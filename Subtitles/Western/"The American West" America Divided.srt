<i>were unable to secure
victory for the North,</i>

178
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:44,807
<i>Abraham Lincoln promoted
Grant to lead the US Army,</i>

179
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,042

<i>Narrator: With tensions
rising in the former Confederacy,</i>

183

<i>H.W. Brands: When Grant
took control of the army,</i>

185

<i>he had to deal with
leftover matters from the Civil War.</i>

186
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:21,574
Grant understood that
there was a feeling in the South

187
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,944
that this defeat was
something that still might be resisted.

188
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,681
<i>And Grant had to attend to that.</i>

189
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,487
<i>Narrator: Grant knows he can't
let rebels like Jesse James</i>

190

191
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,563
<i>So he sends more US
troops south to maintain order</i>

192
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,267

193
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,706
<i>Just over a year since the
end of the Civil War,</i>

194

<i>it's North versus South again.</i>

195

<i>Brands: During the
immediate aftermath of the Civil War,</i>

201

202
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,811
<i>and Union soldiers were in occupation
of much of the South.</i>

203
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,848
<i>Southerners generally resisted this.</i>

204
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:45,085
<i>It was, from their
perspective, a continuation of the Civil War</i>

205
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,654
in which northerners imposed their will,

206
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:50,622
imposed their ways on the South.

<i>Narrator: But the
increased military presence</i>

208
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,027

<i>Narrator: With the Civil War
on the verge of starting up again,</i>

213
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,636
<i>Grant knows a new strategy is
needed to heal the nation.</i>

214
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,601
<i>So he and the US government</i>

215
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,470
<i>look to a plan laid out by

<i>during the Civil War... Abraham Lincoln.</i>

217
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,883
<i>Lincoln knew that the
key to healing the country</i>

218
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,118
<i>would be to give all
Americans the promise</i>

219

there's a chance for

222

<i>and the challenge of

236
00:17:01,215 --> 00:17:04,415
<i>Narrator: The challenge is figuring out</i>

West as quickly as possible.</i>

238

<i>Some say he curled it himself.</i>

381
00:27:48,546 --> 00:27:52,347
He wore a signature
costume, if you will,

382
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:53,949
that he called a uniform.

383
00:27:57,587 --> 00:28:01,123

<i>and a broad-rimmed hat.</i>

385
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:08,463
And he just showed
himself to be superior to others.

Where did you acquire that insignia
on your uniform, soldier?

387

00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,846
You are a disgrace to my unit.

Lieutenant, why are you falling back?

408

<i>But as the North's postwar domination
of the South continues...</i>

<i>Jesse is starting to think bigger.</i>

443

<i>He decides that the best way to
express his hatred for the North</i>

444

<i>In the first 80 years

<i>there was not a

<i>And even in the South,</i>

<i>they hold mostly northern money.</i>

450
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,773
<i>Rob a bank and you're stealing
northern wealth.</i>

451

<i>Sutherland: Jesse

453
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:15,428

No.

When Jesse fires that gun,

00:35:53,879 --> 00:35:58,081
there's a welled-up bitterness
that's been boiling for years.

00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:42,049
they were, "Yeah, I'm
right. You know, I was questioning

518
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:44,584
whether or not I should have robbed
that bank, but now I know I'm right."

519
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,286
(laughs)

520
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:48,421
<i>Narrator: With his reputation growing,</i>

521
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:51,358
<i>Jesse James is fanning the
flames of rebellion in the South.</i>

522
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:57,630
<i>Over 400 miles away,</i>

523
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,967
<i>the US government is
dealing with an even greater problem</i>

524
00:38:01,102 --> 00:38:02,301
<i>than southern uprisings...</i>

525
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:09,174
<i>as Indian attacks by
warriors like Crazy Horse</i>

526
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:11,643
<i>are slowing down western progress.</i>

527
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,384
<i>But General Ulysses S.
Grant has an answer...</i>

528
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,555
<i>Civil War hero George Armstrong Custer.</i>

529
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,528
Grant was quite happy with
the performance of Custer.

530
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:37,168
<i>Custer was one of the great
heroes during the Civil War.</i>

531
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:39,469
<i>He was also willing to
do whatever was necessary</i>

532
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:42,285
to deal with the Indian issue right now.

533
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:45,942
<i>Narrator: For
Custer, it's the opportunity</i>

534
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:49,579
<i>he's been waiting for to
step back into the spotlight.</i>

535
00:38:56,088 --> 00:38:59,089
<i>For months, Custer has
been hunting bands of Indians</i>

536
00:38:59,191 --> 00:39:00,923
<i>across the southern plains...</i>

537
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:03,525
Halt!

538
00:39:03,627 --> 00:39:06,061
<i>But hasn't been able to track them down.</i>

539
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:15,420
<i>Gardner: I think Custer
had the same ambitions</i>

540
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:18,388
that any long-term military
officer had.

541
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,428
That was to advance in rank.

542
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:24,411
<i>Advance in rank and to
win laurels, win glory.</i>

543
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:27,215
<i>That was hard to do in
the post-Civil War West.</i>

544
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:30,484
<i>I mean, you weren't
meeting a foe that was lined up</i>

545
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,353
with 10,000 men on the field of battle.

546
00:39:32,488 --> 00:39:35,188
You were meeting a very elusive foe.

547
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,292
<i>So I think Custer was frustrated often</i>

548
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:43,130
<i>with what he wanted to do,
and I think he wanted glory.</i>

549
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:52,204
<i>Narrator: Finally,
Custer catches a break.</i>

550
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:12,290
<i>His regiment discovers a
band of Cheyenne Indians</i>

551
00:40:12,425 --> 00:40:14,325
<i>camped near the Washita River</i>

552
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:17,361
<i>suspected of
attacking settlers and troops.</i>

553
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,565
Get the men ready.

554
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:22,633
Half an hour.

555
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:26,670
I want to hit them with
everything we've got.

556
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:32,709
You have your orders.

557
00:40:32,812 --> 00:40:34,411
Yes, sir.

558
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:47,156
<i>Narrator: Desperate for
another chance at greatness,</i>

559
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:49,926
<i>Custer prepares a surprise attack.</i>

560
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:57,533
<i>Jacoby: Custer is quite
consciously, I think, very aggressive</i>

561
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:00,035
<i>in his war against Indians</i>

562
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:02,408
because he's really
trying to reclaim the glory

563
00:41:02,518 --> 00:41:04,436
that he experienced during the Civil War

564
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:06,942
<i>when he was this American hero.</i>

565
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:21,681
<i>Narrator: It's only been three
years since the Civil War ended.</i>

566
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,128
<i>But now with Custer
riding into a battle for glory...</i>

567
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:34,901
<i>and Jesse James inciting
a rebellion in the South...</i>

568
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:41,774
<i>America is on the brink of
fighting a two-front war.</i>
