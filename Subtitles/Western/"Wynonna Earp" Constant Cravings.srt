1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,373
- Previously on Wynonna Earp...
- You wait until everyone

2
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:06,960
you love is in agony.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,959
All I want are the scumbags
who came for Ward Earp.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,507
But I have a picture of all seven

5
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:15,450
standing by your dad's dead body.

6
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:18,030
I know you've been looking
for a Stone Witch?

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,020
- I have her name.
- (loud bang)

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,940
I have encountered
this before at the B.B.D.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,440
- Kandahar?
- We're all guilty

10
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:25,880
of something, right, Earp?

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,890
We can't.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,919
- (thump)
- (groaning)

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,870
C'mon, baby. Use... the force...

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,089
Crap. (grunting)

15
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,969
See, you're dead. Again.

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,960
And unlike revenants, you
can't come back to life.

17
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:46,567
(grunting)

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,320
Except as a ghost, I'll
haunt your ass sideways.

19
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,490
Come on. Nope.

20
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:59,330
Stay focused, Earp. I want you here...

21
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:01,285
- now.
- That's what all the boys say.

22
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:04,218
Oh, yeah?

23
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:07,839
- (yelling)
- No... No.

24
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:11,392
No.

25
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:13,261
Dead.

26
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:15,179
Wake up!

27
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,108
- Break his shoulder.
- Or we could

28
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,711
just go for a beer. Come on.

29
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:28,526
- (groaning)
- Come on. Find my weakness.

30
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:35,116
Ice cream? The Clippers? Thongs?

31
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,368
The revenants are going to
win, you're going to fail,

32
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,421
and then we're all going to die.

33
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:43,341
(grunting)

34
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:51,966
(cheering)

35
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,185
Say my name, bitch!

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,520
No, I mean... Make your
peace. It's my new jam.

37
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,639
(humming)

38
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,978
- Good job.
- You think I don't listen, but I do.

39
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,899
- Yeah, you've limbered up.
- Yoga.

40
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:10,902
- No, it's something else.
- What?

41
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:13,704
- What makes you say that?
- Yoga fosters serenity

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,991
and I see zero evidence of that.

43
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:19,911
No inner rest for the wicked.

44
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,631
'Cause I still have a hideous to-do list.

45
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,583
Show that to Waverly.

46
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:28,002
See if she can
identify the last two revenants.

47
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:30,171
Way ahead of you.

48
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:33,591
Except for the showing her
part, which I am going to do.

49
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:36,928
At dinner. Come with? It's on you.

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,181
I got to clean up.

51
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:43,267
You got to loosen up. Later!

52
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,608

You said Clootie would be there.

00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:53,087
No, I said it was her last-known
name and address.

71
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,557
And that much is a goddamned gift.

72
00:03:56,592 --> 00:04:00,227
Well, your "gift," as
you call it, was useless.

73
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:03,431
- Tits on a bull.
- Then she's in the wind.

74
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:07,318
And I'm thinking you're
the reason she ran.

75
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:09,603
Know any idea why that would be?

76
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:12,490
The one that comes to
mind, I mean, perhaps,

77
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,492
is that I want the witch dead.

78
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:16,694
(throat clearing)

79
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:20,948
I sympathize with your predicament.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,084
I'm also two spits away from
finding the one thing

81
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,086
that I want most in this world.

82
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:27,455
But damned if I can't turn it up now.

83
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:31,042
- Why would that be, Doc?
- I really don't give a shit.

84
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:33,044
(chuckling)

85
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:35,679
See, my interest in you
has waned and I have located

86
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,549
other parties whose pursuits are more...

87
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,601
comparable to mine.

88
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,720
Really.

89
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,691
(low voice) I will leave your tongue

90
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,194
flapping out your windpipe.

91
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,697
You'll be pulling lead out
of your ass for months.

92
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,150
(click)

93
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:58,319
I'm bored.

94
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:01,155
Leave if you want.

95
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:04,241
Go get dead.

96
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,794
Only one death scared me.

97
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,829
And it didn't take.

98
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:14,385
Bobo.

99
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,408
Where the hell is everyone, Torque?

100
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,556
This is all that
showed up to work today, boss.

101
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,144
Maybe what you pussies need

102
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,229
is a little motivation.

103
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:27,264
(whirring)

104
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:35,523
Please, boss! (yelling)

105
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,828
- (cell dinging)
- Oh!

106
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:43,497
Woop!

107
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:46,917
Ugh! Ever hear of manscaping?

108
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:49,753
Hey, that was meant for private eyes.

109
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:52,706
Don't tell me you're back chomping
at the Champ. Come on.

110
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:56,510
- He is just so beneath you.
- Uh, yeah, he is.

111
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:59,130
Gross, dude. There is more to life

112
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:02,883
than crazy hot, toe-curling,
out-of-body,

113
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:05,219
back-into-body,

114
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:07,688
angels-singing-Hallelujah sex.

115
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:10,808
Wait, wait. Hold up. Whose
truck are you borrowing?!

116
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,111
Please. I can get from here to
there on my own horsepower,

117
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:16,814
- thank you.
- Wait, who is it? Is it Dolls?

118
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:19,650
- Please.
- What's up, Waverly?

119
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,652
I never see you.

120
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:23,954
Yeah, I know.

121
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,157
Between late shifts at
Shorty's and well, you know,

122
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:28,959
- my sister's back in town, so.
- Hey, Hetty!

123
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:29,966
(bell dinging)

124
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:32,880
Order up! Hetty, you hustle that
butt before food gets cold!

125
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:36,300
Coming, Mama! She
keeps wondering who does such

126
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:39,837
"terrible things."

127
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,640
Probably someone with
a big bug up their ass.

128
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:47,728
- Wait... Coffee? More coffee?
- Not getting any better, hon.

129
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:50,764
But I know that some day

130
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:52,766
people will see through the noise

131
00:06:52,818 --> 00:06:54,578
and understand what a
beautiful soul you are.

132
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:58,489
Let's get serious.

133
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:01,025
Ugh, God, I hate that picture.

134
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:03,494
I love it. Reminds me why I'm needed.

135
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,496
Two left.

136
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,032
Faceless is a pain-in-my-ass mystery.

137
00:07:08,034 --> 00:07:11,368
But this one...

138
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,787
You know anything
about Neck Tattoo here?

139
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,540
Uh...

140
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,876
Yeah, looks like an old cattle brand.

141
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:22,179
For that sort of stuff,
Uncle Curtis used to go and see...

142
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:26,133
- No. No, no, no.
- Who?

143
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:29,603
No, nobody goes out there
unless they really have to.

144
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,274
Who is this person nobody goes
to see unless they have to?

145
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:36,610
The Blacksmith.

146
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:38,646
(intense music)

147
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:43,200
Tell me more about this Blacksmith.

148
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:46,153
In 10 words or less? 'Cause
that's all Waverly had.

149
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:49,240
Artist, loner, mucho
info about the Triangle.

150
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:51,292
OK, so are they going to
help us with a revenant,

151
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:53,961
- some revenants, or what?
- Look.

152
00:07:53,996 --> 00:07:56,580
I'm the one with the
vendetta. Why are you gunning so hard?

153
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,882
- (click)
- Ooh! What?

154
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:01,669
Don't move. Landmine.

155
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:05,139
Oh, good. There's more.

156
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:09,476
And it comes with accessories.

157
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,167
Always been branded a bad girl,

158
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,044
just didn't expect
it to happen for real.

159
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:24,933
You know, the only thing I
hate more than trespassers

160
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:28,603
is an Earp. I mean, I can feel
your negative energy from here.

161
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,723
But landmines and a magical
hot poker scream good vibes?

162
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:34,476
Who's your barely disguised friend?

163
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,895
FBI, CIA, UPS?

164
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:38,814
Don't ask. It takes him
like, five minutes to explain

165
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,149
and we don't have time.
I'm kind of in the shit,

166
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,985
and you're the only one who can help.

167
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:45,787
- Why should I?
- Because if you don't help us,

168
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,291
you're going to be helping things
far worse than an Earp.

169
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:52,294
- Good answer.
- Thanks.

170
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,880
(sighs)

171
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:57,299
Alright. Come on.

172
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,501
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hello!

173
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:01,920
How do you deactivate...?

174
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:05,173
Great Gaia, it's not live.

175
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,843
What do you think I am?

176
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:11,179
One, two, three.

177
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:13,431
(scream)

178
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,484
(sighs)

179
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
(machinery humming)

180
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:35,871
- Hard-core.
- That's what it means?

181
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:39,207
That's what they were. These
are livestock brands

182
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,460
from the late 1800s till
now. Registered and unregistered.

183
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,846
So you made all of these?

184
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:48,466
No. I've collected
them here as a reminder.

185
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:53,438
Those who are
marked... who are chosen...

186
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:56,358
- often did not choose it themselves.
- I feel you, sister.

187
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:59,110
The Tate family were cattle rustlers.

188
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:01,146
They stole livestock and
rebranded it as their own.

189
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:04,032
- Any Tates still in the area?
- Not that I know of.

190
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:08,069
You're in pain. I felt it straightaway.

191
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:11,489
Just a cold going around.

192
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,708
There's a battle.

193
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:15,710
Deep inside.

194
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:18,914
Your soul is being
torn. You must protect it.

195
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,967
Let me make you a salve.

196
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:24,636
Hey. You got one that'll
cure "crotchety curmudgeon-itis"?

197
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:27,589
- 'Cause he's got a raging case.
- We got everything we need.

198
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:29,424
- Come on, Earp.
- Sorry. He's not used to

199
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:32,177
acting normal... human.

200
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,179
Thanks for your help.

201
00:10:34,181 --> 00:10:36,848
(footsteps)

202
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,401
(birds chirping)

203
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,436
(Waverly): God, there's just so much.

204
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:43,772
(Champ): Yeah. Curtis spent the
last few years of his life

205
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:46,408
hand-picking it, from
the Badlands to the Rockies.

206
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:48,410
And you know that because...?

207
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:51,579
'Cause every time he went out,
I did two things, drive and dig.

208
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:54,249
Curtis had a nose for buried stuff.

209
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:58,036
He was kind of like you, into the...

210
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:01,006
into the past of where things come from

211
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,925
and stuff before today, uh...

212
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:07,295
- You mean like "history"?
- Yep.

213
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,548
How can somebody so
pretty be so smart, huh?

214
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,386
Because they're not mutually exclusive.

215
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,888
'Member the last time we
got mutually exclusive?

216
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,057
Now that was historic, eh?

217
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:21,276
- Huh? Right?
- Babe.

218
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,528
Not in front of my legacy.

219
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:26,064
What's this?

220
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:29,234
Oh, my God. Uncle Curtis.

221
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:35,657
- It's his handwriting.
- What is it?

222
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:42,998
- It's a poem.
- (fart sound)

223
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,417
"There once was a
girl from Nantucket..." Huh?

224
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,836
- (chuckling)
- (door opening)

225
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:51,389
- Hands off my sister, nine seconds!
- It was eight seconds, loser.

226
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:55,343
Waves. In your research,

227
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:58,263
you come across any "cattle
rustlers"? Tate family?

228
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:01,433
Yeah, sure. I guess
somewhere along the way they went legit

229
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,568
because they
eventually morphed into Tatenhill.

230
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,570
As in Tatenhill Farms?

231
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:10,075
Totally organic operation, grass-fed...

232
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,861
- Neck Tat?
- Think so.

233
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:18,366
- (loud gasp)
- (Waverly): What the hell?

234
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:20,368
1200 stage one Screaming Eagle!

235
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,504
Yeah, I hauled it for Waverly.

236
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,173
No, Curtis's will stipulated
that the bike goes to Wynonna.

237
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:29,294
- What?
- (scream-laughing)

238
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:32,514
I knew we were soulmates.

239
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:34,766
Ohhh!

240
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,885
(Wynonna purring)

241
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:39,554
What am I going to name this sexy beast?

242
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,806
Doc!

243
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:43,975
Never seen a cowgirl look
more at home in the saddle.

244
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:48,063
Bend your ear a
moment, Wynonna? In private?

245
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,115
(door opening)

246
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,072
You're here! Why are you here?

247
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:59,207
I just... 'Cause of course, you can be.

248
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:00,639
It's just, I wasn't expecting...

249
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:02,210
That would be weird. Why would I?

250
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:04,829
When it comes to
understanding the delicate nature of women,

251
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,082
I'm not the fastest draw in the west.

252
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,884
And I always find it
difficult to make the request of a lady.

253
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,721
- But you know, we...
- We? There's no "we."

254
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:16,724
'Cause if there was, that
would just be way...

255
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,644
- Exactly.
- Yeah, exactly.

256
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,263
Wait, what are you asking me?

257
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:24,315
Wynonna...

258
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:30,438
I need you to arrange a meeting for me

259
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,323
with Deputy Marshal Dolls.

260
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:39,164
Yes, but with all due respect, sir,

261
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,282
I heard you the first time.

262
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,371
Sir, the supply is low. I
had to dilute some of the...

263
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:49,457
(heavy breathing)

264
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,427
Look, I need more.

265
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,429
I understand.

266
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:56,931
(phone clattering)

267
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,134
(Wynonna): Yo, Dolls!

268
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:03,271
Yes. I'll be right out.

269
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:05,273
(sighing)

270
00:14:05,308 --> 00:14:07,392
(knocking)

271
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:11,563
You know, there are some things...

272
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:15,233
He wants to talk to you.

273
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:19,061
- About what exactly?
- I don't know. He's right here.

274
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,723
Could you kindly
convey to Deputy Marshal Dolls

275
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,761
that the nature of my visit is earnest?

276
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:26,470
Nope. Not getting in the middle of this.

277
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,677
Besides, there is one sprinkle
donut out there

278
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:31,142
- with my name all over it.
- (door slamming)

279
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,053
I know you and me,

280
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:37,140
we're as different as
whiskey and tea. But I find myself

281
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,094
in the compromising
position of needing your help.

282
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,977
Well, tea's getting
cold, Holliday. What's up?

283
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,631
I'm looking for a
woman. Used to go by the name

284
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:47,441
of Constance Clootie. Now
she uses the alias C.C. Stone.

285
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,159
- Bobo's lawyer?
- And the witch responsible

286
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,148
for my tenure at the
bottom of that godforsaken well.

287
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,814
Witch... the Stone Witch?

288
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,638
- I don't know her by that name.
- Why should I help you?

289
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:01,799
Well, because I know how badly

290
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,124
you want
information on one Bobo Del Rey?

291
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:11,845
I need evidence of his
more unearthly activities.

292
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:13,935
You get me that and we
have a deal. You understand?

293
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,375
But then again, he
wasn't the risk-taker that I am.

294
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,577
You have the day to deliver.

295
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:55,218
(quiet groaning)

296
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,721
Is it official? Are
you two going steady?

297
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,475
Yeah, we've come to an agreement.

298
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,643
So how do you feel about cows?

299
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,396
(intense music)

300
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,015
(distant mooing)

301
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:15,856
(loud thump)

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,033
(Dolls coughing)

303
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,420
OK, so we need this one
alive. HQ says we're not delivering.

304
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,256
They need hard
evidence of revenant activity...

305
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,926
quid pro quo for the
resources they provide.

306
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,928
What resources? You won't
even buy me dinner.

307
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,097
Could you please take
this seriously just one

308
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,432
goddamned time?

309
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,969
OK. A,

310
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:48,141
the last guy who talked to
me like that got a nail gun

311
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,107
to the nads.

312
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,943
And B, creepy dude.

313
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,228
Farmhouse porch. 2 o'clock.

314
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,700
Oh, yeah, Dolls. That's him.

315
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:09,659
Hey! Stop! I've got beef with you, Tate.

316
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,295
And it's not just delivering meat puns.

317
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,881
- Leave us alone.
- Don't shoot him, Earp.

318
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:23,757
I can see your great-great-granddaddy
in your eyes.

319
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,393
Last thing I saw before...

320
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:28,645
I can cuff him, Earp. Put
Peacemaker down, OK?

321
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,931
He attacked my home, Dolls.

322
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,933
Dragged my sister to her death.

323
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,318
Took a souvenir photo
with my father's body.

324
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,522
And I hope he burned in Hell!

325
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:45,195
(warped yelling)

326
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:50,116
What the hell, Earp? Now
they're going to delay...

327
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:52,786
Goddammit!

328
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,790
Dolls, there'll be another one.
There's always another one.

329
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,960
What the hell is your deal?

330
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:03,346
(extended groan)

331
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,299
- It's human.
- In theory anyway.

332
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,301
(distant, warped screaming)

333
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,057
Us. "Leave us alone."

334
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:16,560
That's what Tate said.

335
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:19,229
So who the hell is "us"?

336
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:28,610
Why do revenants always have
to be such a freakin' hassle?

337
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:31,198
This guy had a mummified
arm on his property. And this.

338
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,034
This is way more than a "hassle."

339
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:36,286
Good point. The at-home
butcher shop raises it

340
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:39,005
to the level of aggravation.

341
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,803
But the creep factor on
this aggro goes to 11.

342
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:57,774
Not so much "family" as "victims."

343
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,277
Maybe he tries to
keep their memories alive.

344
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:02,612
Oh, that's nice.

345
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:06,066
You know, for a serial killer.

346
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:27,087
(crashing)

347
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:33,894
(footsteps)

348
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:46,356
(clanking)

349
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:49,025
(footsteps)

350
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:55,248
Ooh, are we going to role-play?

351
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:57,784
Please don't shoot, Sheriff.

352
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:01,288
My husband's in the
barn, so take what you will.

353
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,757
And now you say...

354
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,460
Well, how fortuitous for
me to find you here.

355
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:09,596
Or does the good luck fall on you?

356
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:12,215
Baby, either talk sense

357
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:14,134
with those lips or use
'em for something else.

358
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:17,804
Now, this is what Bobo's been digging up

359
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,607
half of Purgatory for? These two fellas?

360
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,435
It's taken him years. Word is their

361
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,944
bits are spread out for miles.

362
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:27,197
- Why?
- I'll tell you if you gimme a ride.

363
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:30,700
See, Bobo's putting 'em
back together for some slut

364
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:34,788
in fancy clothes. To
make some kind of trade.

365
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:37,290
Bethany, love, you
don't set up the stakes

366
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:40,043
and then give your hand away.

367
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:43,830
Seriously? You ain't so hot, you know.

368
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:49,386
Don't. You'll be even less
hot when you're dead.

369
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:51,388
Bobo will kill you if he
finds out you were here.

370
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:54,140
And I'll kill you if you tell him I was.

My grandfather Edwin
Earp, the one-year wonder?

00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:50,146
That was the year he was the

when my dad became the heir!

383

And then nothing until...

384
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:56,953
but that's before.

385

The bone marrow in this

386
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,959
Spontaneous mummification
isn't unknown in nature. But this...

Ain't natural.

388
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:20,927
Those are human bite marks.

389
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:22,929
A cannibal revenant?

390
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:25,073
Resources were scarce in
the old west. People starved.

391
00:22:25,194 --> 00:22:26,816
Eat or be eaten.

got a taste for it.

394
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:33,773
Like cilantro.

395
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:37,611
Yeah, I was thinking more of
the Donner party, but sure.

396
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:41,498
Ugh. I can't believe this
guy was eating people.

397

we're looking for a woman.

414

Here. Look, he sat here. Every day.

415
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,797
Yeah, what about a "beautiful mug"?

416
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:11,917

(Dolls): Alright, he
was running that way.

423
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,189
It's an open field.

424
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:37,242
So we would've seen
him running for miles. Odd.

425
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,281
This is where you shot him.

426
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:45,534

427
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:54,293

429
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:59,881

Dolls. Mama Olive. The
woman who owns the diner?

of her sitting in this exact chair.

was doing down here? Hiding?

Herman. He's my brother. But I didn't

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,090
have anything to do with it. I swear.

510
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,593

511
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:57,812

think? What did you do with her?

512
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:01,399
(low voice) It's Mama. She got him.

513
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,401
- I'm sorry.
- Got who?

514
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:07,238
- She's hungry. Starving.
- Mama Olive is the cannibal?!

515

Yeah.

You did see the "No Trespassing"

Uh, I was wondering, um...

520
00:30:25,853 --> 00:30:27,770
I need to talk with you.

521
00:30:27,855 --> 00:30:30,155
And you think an $8 bottle of pinot's
going to make me listen?

522
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:32,575
Hell, no. No, the wine's mostly for me.

Curtis McCready. I shoulda known.

525
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,284
Hurry up.

526
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:45,170
(Wynonna): Move your
ass. You better not be lying.

527
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:47,540
She'd take him to her cellar. I swear.

528
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:50,292
I never liked you, you know.

529
00:30:50,378 --> 00:30:52,294
I have a gun at your back, you idiot!

530
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,215
I'll make you a deal. Take Mama.

531
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,935
- She is a cold, hard harpy.
- Thought I had a bad childhood.

532
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:04,473
- Dolls! Dolls!
- (banging)

533
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,442
Hermie made sure that no
one would ever be heard.

534
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,777
(groaning)

535
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,813
(heavy breathing)

536
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:16,619
(gunshots)

537
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:19,154
(growling)

538
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,957
Where's the key?

539
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:25,661
I ask the Earth to give up this ash.

540
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:31,584
I ask the air to silence its name.

541
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:37,423
I ask the water to cleanse this girl.

542
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,394
I ask the fire...

543
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:47,066
to loosen its hold.

544
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,356
Free from the tethers, purified
by the elements,

545
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:56,609
Waverly Earp, you are
now open to receive

546
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:59,662
this fragment of man into your life.

547
00:31:59,697 --> 00:32:03,616
- Do you accept?
- I do.

548
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,201
(whispering) Wait. Did
I just marry a skull?

549
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:10,039
You are connected. You are as one.

550
00:32:10,124 --> 00:32:13,842
The Keeper of the Bones,
and the Stone Witch's Son.

551
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:16,211
- (low voice whispering)
- (gasping)

552
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:18,213
OK, what have I done?

553
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:20,100
When I bonded Curtis
to the skull, I didn't

554
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,684
know whose it was. It never told me.

555
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,202
- What?
- She's going to be coming for me.

556
00:32:23,203 --> 00:32:24,687
I need protection.

557
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:26,855
- I need to find some salt.
- What?

558
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:28,974
Who's coming? Am I in danger?

559
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,728
Of course you are. This is
what it means to be blessed.

560
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:34,730
You poor sweet girl, what
was Curtis thinking?

561
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:44,657
- Wynonna!
- (low voice) She can't hear you.

562
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:48,127
Say your prayers, sweetheart.

563
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:54,166
I got a hollow place in my
belly that needs to be fed.

564
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:57,419
- (growling)
- Hurry up.

565
00:32:57,471 --> 00:32:59,755
- I'm trying.
- If you know where they are

566
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:01,757
- and you're not telling me...
- I swear I don't.

567
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,226
Look.

568
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:07,896
I need you to understand. See,
we didn't have a daddy.

569
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:11,100
Mama had some money, but
she put it all into an old hotel

570
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:12,641
and restaurant.
Back then, if food didn't

571
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,236
have maggots in it,
they practically gave it

572
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:16,238
- a Michelin Star.
- OK, no more food talk.

573
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:18,047
Ms. Olive, you don't have
to live like this.

574
00:33:18,072 --> 00:33:19,215
We could take you somewhere

575
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:22,027
where people could understand
what you are.

576
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:24,246
You think I'm some fragile old lady?

577
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:28,083
Back then, you lived and
died by what the seasons gave you.

578
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,078
(roaring)

579
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:31,954
Winter fell. A year of blizzards worse

580
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:34,006
than anybody had ever seen. Livestock
died, deer vanished,

581
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,425
the root cellar got
emptied months before spring.

582
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:38,877
So what, did you eat the hotel guests?

583
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,965
You did!

584
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:46,301
Damn right I did and I'd do it again.

585
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:48,887
Loved it.

586
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:51,356
- You loved the taste?
- Nothing else compared.

587
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:54,610
Then one day, a
certain marshal came into town,

588
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:56,612
investigating some missing people.

589
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:59,281
Great-great-granddaddy Wyatt Earp.

590
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:03,068
Herman was all, "We gotta protect
Mama." Such a suck up.

591
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:06,989
He was a good boy.
Yeah. He fought for his Mama.

592
00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:11,243
- Ah! And Hetty?
- She was useless.

593
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,534
Born that way.

594
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,331
Me? I just got caught in
the crossfire and became this.

595
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:17,863
I didn't choose it and it's not fair.

596
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:20,170
- Believe me, I get that.
- I just want

597
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:22,361
to live like a girl. Buy lip-gloss,

598
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,339
- wear flirty skirts...
- Did you find the keys?!

599
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:27,810
Girls don't have them
chances that boys have.

600
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:30,479
I learned that the hard way.

601
00:34:30,514 --> 00:34:32,848
I didn't want Hetty to go through that.

602
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,484
Mama dressed me like a
boy and then like a man.

603
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,188
She looked like
Herman. Very much like twins.

604
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,907
Couldn't tell us apart.

605
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:44,493
Ow!

606
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:46,995
Right down to the goddamn tattoo.

607
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:49,448
Laser removal. Greatest invention

608
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,533
of the 20th century.

609
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:53,752
Ha!

610
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,871
Got 'em.

611
00:34:55,956 --> 00:34:59,041
(sighing)

612
00:34:59,093 --> 00:35:01,343
Ah! Oh, the hunger!

613
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:04,763
Herman! He was such a good boy.

614
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:06,882
He always brought his Mama dinner.

615
00:35:06,934 --> 00:35:08,884
He won't be bringing
you anything anymore.

616
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:11,220
He can't help you.

617
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:13,519
But I can, OK?

618
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:17,442
You are going to be delicious.

619
00:35:17,528 --> 00:35:20,646
(roaring)

620
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:24,032
Your friend is already dead.

621
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:26,902
She's eaten and she's
stronger now. If you open this door,

622
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:29,037
I don't know what she'll do.
- Shut up and help me.

623
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,039
There's something...

624
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:35,244
There's something wrong
with you. You're spoiled!

625
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:38,714
Yeah. I'm an acquired taste.

626
00:35:38,749 --> 00:35:41,583
Dolls? Please don't be eaten!

627
00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:43,919
- I'm OK.
- Can you get the ladder up?

628
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:46,255
I'm not that OK.

629
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,423
You can't get both me and Mama.

630
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:50,315
Yeah, I like to think
big. Toss me the cuffs!

631
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,761
(muttering)

632
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:59,401
OK.

633
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:01,353
(heavy breathing)

634
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:04,156
You know, everyone's right
about you. You are a bitch.

635
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:08,277
Yeah. A bitch with some
hella sexy moves.

636
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:12,281
(yelling)

637
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,116
Cool.

638
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,952
She was the one who wanted
to kill your daddy.

639
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:19,454
And now I'm going to kill you.

640
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,456
- (click)
- (bang)

641
00:36:21,508 --> 00:36:25,260
(roaring)

642
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:27,462
You OK?

643
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:29,464
(crashing)

644
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:33,101
Holy shit, she took the door.

645
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:40,734
(dragging sounds)

646
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:43,153
(grunting)

647
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:48,993
You almost had me, Hetty.

648
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:53,188
One hell of a sob story.

649
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,249
(panting)

650
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:57,251
It's all true.

651
00:36:57,303 --> 00:37:00,671
Except you left out the
part about wanting my daddy dead.

652
00:37:00,673 --> 00:37:03,507
Each time an heir came of age,

653
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:06,260
Mama would get
ravenous and then murderous.

654
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:09,730
Killing Ward was the
only way to stop her.

655
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:12,182
So you are the sixth.

656
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:17,237
This curse won't end until you end.

657
00:37:17,273 --> 00:37:20,774
Funny. I feel the
exact same way about you.

658
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:22,993
(click)

659
00:37:23,029 --> 00:37:24,995
Make your peace.

660
00:37:29,669 --> 00:37:32,586
(low moaning)

661
00:37:32,622 --> 00:37:35,372
(crackling)

662
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:39,043
(sighing and loud breathing)

663
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:41,545
- Hey.
- Hey.

664
00:37:41,547 --> 00:37:45,466
- Good job.
- I know.

665
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:47,685
OK, let's go get my gun.

666
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,887
Can't we just enjoy the moment for once?

667
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:52,556
Earp!

668
00:37:52,558 --> 00:37:54,975
(sighing) Coming.

669
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:57,027
♪ ♪

670
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:15,713
Hey, thanks for bringing my "lunch."

671
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:18,749
- Was it any trouble?
- Of course it was.

672
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:20,442
Do you know what
they'll do to me if they

673
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:22,052
find out I smuggled that from the lab?

674
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:24,171
They track that
shit like it's plutonium.

675
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:26,423
Look, I just needed
enough to tide me over, alright?

676
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:29,510
Whatever you did to
get yourself cut off?

677
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:31,512
Undo it.

678
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:36,350
The people upstairs want results.

679
00:38:36,402 --> 00:38:39,319
Don't call me again.

680
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:42,156
(zipping)

681
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:44,191
(shaky breathing)

682
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,952
Doc. Now's not a good time.

683
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:57,337
Just so you know, my
mission was for naught.

684
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:59,339
Yeah, you said you'd
get something on Bobo.

685
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:01,458
I couldn't get close enough.

686
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,178
You OK, there, partner?

687
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:06,463
(Dolls sighs)

688
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,465
Our deal's off.

689
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,768
I think it is time for you to leave, OK?

690
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:12,770
I see what is happening to you.

691
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:14,722
The sweating. The skittery disposition.

692
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:17,307
The stink of desperation for the drug.

693
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:19,727
Whatever it may be.

694
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:22,696
- Get out of my way.
- I want C.C. Stone.

695
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:24,698
And I...

696
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:26,700
I want you gone.

697
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:30,537
Leave Wynonna alone. You're
gonna get her killed.

698
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:34,408
Least I wouldn't be in
withdrawal when I did.

699
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,994
