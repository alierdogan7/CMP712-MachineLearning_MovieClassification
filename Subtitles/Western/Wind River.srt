1
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,800
Man: I am Washakie,
of the great Shoshone Nation.

2
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,600
I wish to share with you
the story of Nick Wilson,

3
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,600
or Yagaichi, as he is best
remembered
among the Shoshone people.

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,300
The legend
of the white Indian boy

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,500
took place within our familiar
valleys and mountains,

6
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,600
known as "Wind River."

7
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,700
Yah!

8
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,300
Damn.

9
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,900
Shoshone.

10
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Aah!

11
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,100
Yagaichi!

12
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,200
He's a comin'.

13
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,900
Take him.

14
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,400
- Pretty good time.
- I’ve e been riding like hell.

15
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,000
What happened to you?

16
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Shoshones.
Pocatello's band again.

17
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
- Did you get 'em?
- I didn't have to.

18
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,200
You didn't have to?

19
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,900
Man: Kid, you ain't too smart
taking them Injuns lightly.

20
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,800
Ain't gonna be
safe around here

21
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
until they're all
dead and buried.

22
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,100
Yeah, well, as I recall,
they were here first.

23
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,700
Say, that's a nasty one,
we'd better take care of it.

24
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,600
There's a message
from your ma'.

25
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
There's some old woman
staying at your house

26
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
with a funny name.
Anaba?

27
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,500
Anuba.

28
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,900
- Apparently...
- Don't take that! I got

29
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,800
to go to Grantsville!

30
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,500
Man: Nick. Nick.

31
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,400
N iii-iiick!

32
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Nick! Nick!

33
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,500
- Whoa!
- Hey! It's my turn!

34
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,600
Whoa, aah!

35
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,300
(both laughing)

36
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,900
Nick: Someday I'd like to ride
a real fast horse.

37
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
You have trouble
to ride the sheep.

38
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Someday I'll be
a great rider.

39
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,700
(laughing)

40
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,300
Maybe you could learn
on your muuda.

41
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,200
My what?

42
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,100
Muuda.

43
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,000
I taught you.
Donkey.

44
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,100
I'd rather ride
a Bu... bungo,

45
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,900
and be a great
Da... dagwahni.

46
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,800
You learn fast.

47
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,600
But white cannot be great
warriors. Only Indians.

48
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,700
Like my brothers
to the north.

49
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,500
I'll be
a great explorer then,

50
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
like Louis and Clark.

51
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
Anything
but a sheep-herder.

52
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,100
The great Shoshones
of the Wind River.

53
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,900
My father ride with them.

54
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,400
He tell me
they scalp Crow and Sioux

55
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,500
while they ride
on their horses.

56
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
Golly.

57
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,900
Pantsuk,

58
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,000
maybe we could
leave this place.

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,900
We could run away.

60
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,800
We could live
with your brothers in the north.

61
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,100
What about our families?

62
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,900
What about the sheep?

63
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,500
We can let Sylvester
take care of everything,

64
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,900
since he knows
so much.

65
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,500
Come on,
let's make a pact.

66
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,600
What is pact?

67
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,000
A promise...
or an agreement.

68
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Blood brothers.

69
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Pact.

70
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,700
Lots of hunts,
and fishing.

71
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,400
We'll need horses and packs
for the trip.

72
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,400
And much jerky.

73
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,600
That's for sure.

74
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Pantsuk, you're
my best tsaa hainj.

75
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,100
You are
my best friend, too.

76
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,900
Aah! What'd you
do that for?

77
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,900
I should do worse.
And you...

78
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,500
Why aren't you helping
your father?

79
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,400
- Get goin'.
- Leave him alone.

80
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,900
This is your job...

81
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,200
to make sure the coyotes
don't kill the sheep.

82
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,100
When grown, that lamb
could have kept us for a month.

83
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
If I ever catch you
slacking off again,

84
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,300
I'll kick your scrawny hide
to Salt Lake and back,

85
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
- you hear me?
- I can't do it all by myself.

86
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,700
I hate this place.

87
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,000
(sobbing)

88
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,500
Washakie: Before the dreams,

89
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,500
My mother Anuba,

90
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,200
a shaman and healer
among our people,

91
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,100
could not speak
for a very long time.

92
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,600
A mighty avalanche had taken
her two sons, my brothers.

93
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,100
When mother started
having the visions,

94
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,200
the power was understood.

95
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
She knew the boy
in her dreams

96
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,000
was good medicine
for our nation.

97
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,600
And we must find him.

98
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,800
I sent my finest warrior,

99
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,000
Morogonai.

100
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,700
(calling)

101
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
- What are you looking at?
- Don't do that.

102
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,100
You wanna wake the dead?
Then hush.

103
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,000
- What are you looking at?
- Shh!

104
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,400
It's Louis and Clark
if you must know.

105
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,300
What's it about?

106
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,700
It's about
Louis and Clark.

107
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,600
- Who are they?
- Surveyors.

108
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,200
- What's surveyors?
- Explorers.

109
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,100
they mapped out all the western
territory with Sacajawea.

110
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
She was a Shoshone.

111
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,700
Shoshones can scalp a person
with one hand

112
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,600
- while riding a horse.
- they ride a horse

113
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,800
- with one hand?
- No,

114
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
- they scalp with one hand.
- How do you know?

115
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,700
I just do. Listen,
why are you so nosy, anyway?

116
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,600
You writing a book?

117
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,500
Shh, shh.

118
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,000
Why don't you just go to sleep
before you make me catch hell?

119
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Don't cuss, Nick.

120
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
N ever you mind.
Just go back to sleep.

121
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,600
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

122
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

123
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,800
Don't let
those bed bugs bite.

124
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm gonna bite you.

125
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,900
- Prissy.
- 'Night, Nick.

126
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,800
(signaling)

127
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,700
Nicholas.

128
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,000
(Nick, in haste)
Our Father, bless this food

129
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
so it may nourish
and strengthen our bodies

130
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
and do us the good we need.
We say these things in the name

131
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,700
- of Jesus Christ, Amen.
- Amen.

132
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
I think you s et
a re cord.

133
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,300
Woman: Nicholas.

134
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,200
Criminy, Ma.

135
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,900
I think you boys
are turning into heathens.

136
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,200
It's hotter
than hell out there.

137
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,300
Sylvester, I don't want
any cussing in this house.

138
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,600
If your father were here...

139
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Who do you think
I learned it from?

140
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,300
I never saw ground
so full of rocks.

141
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah, they must be
growing more every y ear.

142
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,100
Ma: Sylvester, your boots
are caked with mud.

143
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Take them outside.

144
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Chicken coop
needs mending.

145
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,800
Chickens got out
last night.

146
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Why you looking at me?
What about Jake?

147
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,900
Just shut up
and mend the fence.

148
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,400
Can't. Got to
watch the sheep.

149
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,100
You'll watch the sheep
after you mend the fence.

150
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,400
Why can't you do it?

151
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,200
- I got to plow.
- Nick: I'll plow.

152
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,400
- You ain't man enough.
- Yes, I am.

153
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,600
You don't even know how,
you dumb jackass.

154
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
- That's enough of that.
- Just fix the fence!

155
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,400
If I don't get them crops in,
you don't eat.

156
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,700
Nick: I wouldn't be
missing much.

157
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
- You ain't starving, are you?
- I might as well be!

158
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Stop it, you two!
I'll mend the fence.

159
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,000
You got too much work.
Nick'll do it.

160
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,100
He does little else around here.
He'll do it after you eat.

161
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,600
- No!
- I said do it!

162
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,200
You can't tell me what to do,
you're not my father!

163
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,900
I hate it here,
and I hate you!

164
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Eliza Nicholas!

165
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
When's father coming home?

166
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,900
Ma: Only
the Good Lord knows.

167
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,300
(chickens clucking)

168
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Nicholas!

169
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
Nicholas, no!

170
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Yah!

171
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,300
Nick: Whoa! Ahh!

172
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,200
Benjamin, stop!
Wait, Benjamin!

173
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Nick: Benjamin, stop!
Stop!

174
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,800
Sylvester: Nick, no!

175
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,400
Nick: Help!
Benjamin stop, please stop!

176
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,200
Stop!

177
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,300
Nick!

178
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Stop!

179
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,700
(thud)

180
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Man: Our Father
who art in heaven,

181
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,900
hallowed be Thy name.

182
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Thy kingdom come,

183
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
Thy will be done,
on earth,

184
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,200
as it is in heaven.

185
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,500
Give us this day
our daily bread,

186
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,600
and forgive us
our trespasses,

187
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,100
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
and lead us not
into temptation,

189
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,500
but deliver us from evil,

190
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,200
for Thine is the power,
and the kingdom,

191
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,600
and the glory,
forever. Amen.

192
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,000
We dedicate
this final resting place

193
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,400
as a place of peace
and tranquility,

194
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,800
until the morning
of the first resurrection,

195
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,100
in Jesus' holy name,

196
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,000
Amen.

197
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,500

Native American language)

198
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,600
(crying)

199
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,000
Stay back,
I'm warning you!

200
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,700
I'm not a yagaichi!

201
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,900
What you say?

202
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,400
I said I'm not a crier.

203
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,700
You know Shoshone?

204
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,900
No, just some Gosiute.

205
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,400
How you learn?

206
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,300
My friend.

207
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,700
Pantsuk.

208
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,800
Pantsuk.

209
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,400
What are you
gonna do to me?

210
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,100
- Nick: You gonna scalp me?
- Scalp?

211
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,500
Don't you scalp
white people sometimes?

212
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,800
We scalp you?

213
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,600
Aaah! Ahh!

214
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,900
No! No y ell.
No y ell.

215
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,600
I no scalp you.

216
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,100
Be still.

217
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,700
You be still.

218
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,500
Look.

219
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,600
You see him?
He stand tall.

220
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,000
He strong.
You like him?

221
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
If you come with us,

222
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,300
you keep him.

223
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,900
- You mean, just leave?
- He is fast.

224
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,700
Fast like the wind.

225
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Are you gonna kidnap me?

226
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,600
- Kidnap?
- Force me to go with you?

227
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Force?
No, no, no.

228
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,500
No, no,
we no force you.

229
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
We couldn't just go.
My mother would miss me.

230
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,300
I couldn't hurt her
like that.

231
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,300
We will not take you.

232
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,600
Not take you.

233
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,100
But, maybe...

234
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,200

235
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,000

236
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,900

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,700
like a great man.

249
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,700
Great man.

250
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Morogonai:
The wind calls you.

251
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,900
Pantsuk:

252
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,800

Stop!

292
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,600
Aaah!

293
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,400
This...

294
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,000
no good way
to ride horse.

295
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,300
I know that, I told you,
I can't ride without a saddle.

296
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,600
You must learn.

297
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,700
I want to go back.

298
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,500
No.

299
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,700
You are scared...

300
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,300
to fall.

301
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,000
I will make it...

302
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I will fix it.

303
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,900
U p.

304
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,700
Come on, up.

305
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,100
Here, here.

306
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,900
Now, your feet
no dance.

307
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,600
You no scared,
you no fall.

308
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,400
We must ride.

309
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,300
We rest

310
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,500
when the sun goes down.

311
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,400
Come.
(signaling)

312
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,100
Man: All right, men.

313
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,400
You know why we're here.
We're looking for the boy.

314
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,900
All right?

315
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Sylvester,

316
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,900
why don't you take
those first three men,

317
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,700
and head out on top
of the ridge?

318
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,900
You two men take the bottom,
and the rest of you

319
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
follow me through the canyon
and we'll fan out.

320
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,300
Let's go get him.
Move out.

321
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,700
Stop, please stop.

322
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,500
(crying)

323
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,700
Ohh.

324
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,200
- Why you not talking?
- I did!

325
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,000
You didn't hear.

326
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,000
Come down.

327
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
How you say?
Take off this,

328
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,000
take off this.

329
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,100
Aaah!
It's stuck.

330
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
- Sit down.
- What did he say?

331
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,000
He say you...

332
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,400
very brave.

333
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,700
We must cut off
your legs.

334
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,200
- Don't cut my legs off!
- No, no, we must cut off...

335
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,200
not your legs,

336
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,300
your pants.

337
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,500
Morogonai: Okay.
Be still.

338
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,400
Aaah!

339
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,200
Be strong. Strong.

340
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,500
(fabric ripping)

341
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,100
And your leg?

342
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,000
It hurts.

343
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,900
We need sleep.

344
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,100
We must ride
when the sun goes up.

345
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,500
I don't want to go.

346
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,200
Then you keep.

347
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,900
What's it for?

348
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,000
Mountain lion.

349
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,000
And coyotes.
Many.

350
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,300
Also, many Crow Indians.

351
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,300
This Indian fast
and strong.

352
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,600
You need to keep
hiding in trees.

353
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,100
Crow Indian sees you,

354
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,500
- kill you.
- Can't you take me back?

355
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,500
No.

356
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,400
Many white people
looking for us.

357
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,300
I am feel bad

358
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,100
your leg.

359
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,100
When the sun
rises up,

360
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,100
we go.

361
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,800
Who was that?

362
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,200
Pocatello.

363
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,500
He is Shoshone also.

364
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,100
But he goes away from us.

365
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,600
He is a leader

366
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,500
among the people who...

367
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,800
hate the white man.

368
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,300
What did he say?

369
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,600
He want me
to make a trade...

370
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,800
you for two horses.

371
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,500
What did you say?

372
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,400
Not enough.

373
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Looks like
someone's clothes.

374
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,100
Man: What is it?

375
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,500
It's Nick's trousers.
There's blood on them.

376
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,500
Sylvester: Let's go.

377
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,000
Yah!

378
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,300
Well, brother, we'd better
go after him. Come on.

379
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,100
- Yah!
- Yah!

380
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,300
(yelling signal)

381
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,200
This great man.

382
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,900
Washakie.

383
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,500
He speak

384
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,700
for these people.

385
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,500
You live with him.

386
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,700
This boy

387
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,200
- Yagaichi?
- Yagaichi.

388
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,400
We have been waiting,
Yagaichi.

389
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,500
This woman

390
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,700
Anuba.

391
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,300
She's to be

392
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,800
your mother.

393
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,700
Come.

394
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,300
Come.

395
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,200
I have business
to attend to.

396
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
This place is nice
and flat.

397
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,300
We'll camp here.

398
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
It's not even sun down.
We got a good hour yet.

399
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,800
We've been going
since sun up.

400
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,700
We'll camp here.

401
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,500
Maybe if you aren't
so mad at it, it'll cooperate.

402
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,200
Sylvester,

403
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,100
we're heading back
tomorrow.

404
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,400
We've been at it 10 days,
and we ain't found

405
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,300
nothing
but those britches.

406
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,900
Here could be anywhere
in these mountains,

407
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,000
and he could be nowhere.

408
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,900
We have families
we have to tend to,

409
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,200
and so do you.

410
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,600
Your mother
needs you at home.

411
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,500
We go back tomorrow.

412
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,700
Yagaichi.
Yagaichi.

413
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,500
Oh, Yagaichi.

414
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,800
(all laughing)

415
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,100
Ahwo.

416
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,900
- Ahwo.
- Ahwo? Ahwo.

417
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Bowl.

418
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,600
Bowl.

419
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,000
- Bowl.
- Bowl. Bowl.

420
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,200
Ehhe.

421
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,900
Ehhe?
Ehhe. Ehhe.

422
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,700
Blanket.

423
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,300
- Blanket.
- Blan-ket.

424
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,500
Yeah, you'll be speaking
English in no time.

425
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,300
(wolf howling)

426
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,600
What's the matter?
It's just an old wolf,

427
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,700
- esa.
- Ha ah.

428
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,100
I think my mother
would like you.

429
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,600
You're tough,
but you care.

430
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,500
My mother cares a lot.

431
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,600
She's never really
that tough, though.

432
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,700
It's hard on her.

433
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,400
Anuba.

434
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,000
Yagaichi.

435
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,900
Nick. Nick.

436
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,800
Anuba, Nick.

437
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,600
Yagaichi.

438
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,100
- Nick!
- Yagaichi.

439
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,300
- Nick!
- Yagaichi!

440
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,200
Nick!

441
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,300
Yagaichi.
Yagaichi.

442
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,700
(grunting)

443
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
(grunting)

444
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Ho.

445
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,600
This...

446
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,800
ang...

447
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,600
- an... ange... ang...
- Anger?

448
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,200
Anger. No.
Feet.

449
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,000
Feet. Feet.

450
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,500
Feet.

451
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,000
Feet, feet, head.

452
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,400
Woooo, feet.
Do it.

453
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,900
Do it. Feet.
Feet, feet.

454
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,600
Head, feet, feet.

455
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,600
Woooo, feet.
Wooo.

456
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,300
Woooo.

457
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,200
Anger will not
help you.

458
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,900
Get it.

459
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Hah!

460
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,200
No good.

461
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,100
Good.

462
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,700
Thank you.

463
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,700
- A... an...
- Anger.

464
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,100
- No.
- Okay.

465
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,700
Feet.

466
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,300
(cloth ripping)

467
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,700
Are you all right?
I gave you a pretty good whack.

468
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,300
Sorry.

469
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,200
My name's Ya...
Nick.

470
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,000
What's your name?

471
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,300
Oh, damn it,
how do you say it?

472
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,800
Nick.

473
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,200
- Toma.
- Toma.

474
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,500
Toma, that's nice.

475
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,100
(baby crying)

476
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,700
- Sir?
- Mmm.

477
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,100
How come the women do
so much work around the camp?

478
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,400
- It is what they wish.
- Why?

479
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,300
The women cut
and haul the wood,

480
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,000
pack the meat,
take care of the children,

481
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,700
tan the hides,
make the clothes,

482
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,000
and they do
all the cooking.

483
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,200
Some of what you say
is true.

484
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,300
(speaking
in Native American)

485
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,100
Our mother says the women
want it done correctly.

486
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,800
- Boo!
- Prissy,

487
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,800
what the devil
are you doing out here?

488
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,400
I could've caught you
with the axe.

489
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,300
No, you can't see me
'cause I'm a ghost.

490
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,900
And ghosts are spirits
without bodies.

491
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,900
- How do you know that?
- Sunday school.

492
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,200
Hey, don't get too close.

493
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,700
Nah, you can't hurt ghosts.

494
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,800
An arrowhead!
Sylvester, look!

495
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,900
Maybe the Indians
took Nick,

496
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,600
and they dropped it here.

497
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,800
Nah, I think
he just ran away.

498
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,400
Do you think
he'll ever come home?

499
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,500
- He might be dead.
- Shut up, Jake, just shut up!

500
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,300
And what are you doing out here?
You should be helping Ma.

501
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,800
I turned into a ghost,
and floated out.

502
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,500
Sylvester, look.

503
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,000
Sylvester:
First of the season.

504
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,100
Prissy: Yup.
First of the season.

505
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,300
Winter's just around
the corner.

506
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,300
Yup. Just around
the corner.

507
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,400
Priscilla?
Priscilla?

508
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,300
Don't let her see me.

509
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,500
I thought no one
could see you.

510
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,200
Mothers can see
everything.

511
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,700
- Prissy, I can see you there.
- I told you.

512
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,400
Come in this instant.

513
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,300
Or you'll wish you had.

514
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,500
Sure wish Nick was here.

515
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,200
(wagon approaching)

516
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,200
- Man: Where would you look?
- Everywhere.

517
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,100
That's a lot
of territory to cover.

518
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,500
Martha, your bread
is delicious.

519
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Let me pour you
some more Brigham tea.

520
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,700
Man: How do you know
who took him?

521
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,300
I think it was the Bannocks.
they're the only ones

522
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,600
- who come down this far.
- Why the Bannocks? Why not

523
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,700
the Gosiutes or the Utes
or the Crow or the Shoshone?

524
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,100
they were the first ones
I thought of.

525
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,800
- I have to start somewhere.
- And how do you know

526
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,600
they're not going
to take you?

527
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,700
Or worse, kill you?
Will that help your mother?

528
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,100
Good heavens, boy,
you're a farmer.

529
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,500
You'd be eaten alive
up there.

530
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,500
If not by savages, then
by the bear or mountain lion,

531
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,800
- or by the elements.
- I gotta try.

532
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Don't you understand?
I gotta try.

533
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,100
Can't you wait until
your father comes back?

534
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
It'll be too late then.

535
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,600
You think Nick's dead.

536
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,600
That's not what I'm saying.

537
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,300
Martha?

538
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,200
He's gotta try.

539
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,900
I suppose if Brother Miller
takes your south field,

540
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,400
and Brother Cannon and I
take your north,

541
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,300
I suppose we could manage.

542
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,400
You leave Benjamin,
and take my horse Buck.

543
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,000
- Yes, sir.
- On one condition.

544
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
- You come back to your ma.
- Yes, sir.

545
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,800
Oooh!

546
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,200
You have ears.

547
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,100
U s e.

548
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,700
Nick: So what are you doing?

549
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,100
- Walking.
- That's what I was doing.

550
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,300
I’ve e been practicing
with that bow you gave me.

551
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,900
- Good.
- I think I'm getting better.

552
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,600
- Feet.
- I remember.

553
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,000
Morogonai, why'd you tell
everyone my name was Yagaichi?

554
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,100
That's causing me
some awful trouble.

555
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,500
Good name, Yagaichi.

556
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,500
To be a white man
family Washakie,

557
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,700
you need to be strong.

558
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,700
This name, Yagaichi,

559
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,900
is hard name.

560
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,900
Teach you be strong.

561
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,400
What are you
looking at?

562
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,900
Bad days.

563
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,500
What do you see?

564
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,100
We hunt them.
Making war.

565
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,100
You can see
all that in the sky?

566
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,900
Sometimes the sky...

567
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,400
is open.

568
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,700
When does the sky say
this will happen?

569
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,200
hunt always this...

570
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,900
- what is word? Seas... s eas...
- Season?

571
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,800
Morogonai: Season.
hunt always this season.

572
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,500
But is hard,
this time.

573
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,400
- No many buffalo.
- Why?

574
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,700
these Indian people
living over there.

575
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,400
No keep their land.
No keep their home.

576
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,800
Come here now.

577
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,300
they're hungry.
Need to eat.

578
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,800
Is it 'cause of the whites?

579
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,600
Many white people.

580
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,000
Morogonai,

581
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,400
do you hate the whites?

582
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,900
No. Morogonai no hate.

583
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,300
Hate make man...

584
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,500
I hated
my brother Sylvester.

585
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,500
Is no good, Yagaichi.

586
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,500
Keep...
keep this,

587
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,900
Yagaichi,
keep this.

588
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,400
This life no is long.

589
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
No hate.

590
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,600
No hate.

591
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,600
- Morogonai?
- Mmm, Yagaichi.

592
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,900
How do I find
my vision?

593
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,500
Be still.

594
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,100
Quiet.

595
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,300
No words.

596
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,200
Listen.

597
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,000
Your heart...

598
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,200
vision...

599
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,500
comes.

600
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,800
He tried to do
the right things,

601
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,900
but his help was not
always wanted, or understood.

602
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,600
(speaking Native American)

603
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,000
Morogonai gave the boy
love, friendship,

604
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,200
and taught him
the way of the Shoshone.

605
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,900
And the way
from boy to man.

606
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,600
In battle,
you are no longer.

607
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,700
- Do again.
- I'm trying!

608
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,200
If you'd stop
throwing those rocks...

609
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,800
Aaah! Ah!

610
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,100
Female voice:
(music) Far away (music)

611
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,100
(music) You've learned (music)

612
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,300
(music) About the world (music)

613
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,700
(music) And that we are all one (music)

614
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,100
(music) Look to your spirit (music)

615
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,100
(music) To show you the way (music)

616
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,400
(music) When dreamers dream (music)

617
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,300
(music) The legend goes (music)

618
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,300
(music) It's then you'll know (music)

619
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
(music) The wind calls (music)

620
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,200
(music) Your name (music)

621
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,700
(music) You will always
find a friend (music)

622
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,100
(music) Just open up
your heart (music)

623
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,000
(music) If you believe (music)

624
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,400
(music) Then love will
raise you to new heights (music)

625
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,100
(music) See how your love
runs deep (music)

626
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,400
(music) Like the Rivers
of the wind (music)

627
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,900
(music) Let it soar on wings (music)

628
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,200
(music) And bring you home again. (music)

629
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,800
- (signaling)
- (speaking in Native American)

630
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,700
Morogonai!

631
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,800
Look, it's
the Indian from the road.

632
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,000
Pocatello.

633
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:15,600
- Haata.
- Haata? Poisoned?

634
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,100
- What did he say?
- He want you.

635
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,800
White men trade maybe four,
five horses for you.

636
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,300
Good price.

637
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,900
Sylvester: " Dearest Mother,

638
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,100
once again, I'm afraid there is
no good news to tell you.

639
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,400
I have followed many leads,
but still have no sign of Nick.

640
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,100
It is September now.

641
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,100
I will soon
have to make a choice,

642
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,100
to come home,
or endure another winter.

643
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,200
I wish you could advise me
what to do.

644
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,000
I will write again
as soon as I can.

645
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,700
Send everybody my love,

646
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,700
and tell them
not to worry about me.

647
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,600
I'm doing fine.

648
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,700
Your loving son,
Sylvester."

649
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,500
(yelling signal)

650
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,300
- H uh?
- (chuckling)

651
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,700
White men.

652
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,500
(Morogonai chuckling)

653
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,800
Ya ha.

654
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Man: The Mormons
and the Indians

655
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,600
have one spirit Father.

656
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,200
And He is sad
that we fight.

657
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,400
We do not kill
white people.

658
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,300
No, but some
of your brothers do.

659
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,000
Some of yours do also.

660
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,200
Yes.

661
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,500
And our Father in heaven
is full of sorrow.

662
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,900
The white man comes
in peace.

663
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,300
Of course, there are
bad white men,

664
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,900
just as there are
bad Indians.

665
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,700
But for the most part,

666
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,700
these are poor,
honest folk,

667
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,000
searching for a home.

668
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,300
Your friend Brigham
is concerned for you.

669
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,300
He believes
it will not be many snows

670
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,600
before the game
in your country is gone

671
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,700
and there will be no food
for your families.

672
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,500
Would you change
the color of our skin?

673
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,100
Man: No, but we do not desire
for your people to starve.

674
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,100
We will bring
seed and tools,

675
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,700
and teach you
what you must learn.

676
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:37,400
Send my thanks
to my new friend Big Ham,

677
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,100
and tell him
we will council on his words.

678
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,200
(footsteps)

679
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,300
From brother Brigham.

680
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,600
Brother Brigham wanted
to know your words

681
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,300
about this gift.

682
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,300
This is good.

683
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:21,300
He wanted to know
how you felt about the gift.

684
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,400
Whites have
words for everything.

685
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,100
But they are just words
from here.

686
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,600
But this...

687
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,200
cannot speak.

688
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,200
Nick: Sir, am I ever going
to find out why I'm here?

689
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,000
Washakie:
Soon, you will know.

690
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,800
But I don't understand.
You don't teach me anything

691
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,800
like medicine,
or war, or the like.

692
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,500
N ever mind.

693
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,400
Soon I will know.

694
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,700
Washakie: For strength.

695
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,100
You should see
my real mother.

696
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,500
She's quite pretty.

697
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,900
Anyway, I think she is.

698
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,400
Nick: She's probably calling
everybody in from the field,

699
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,900
and hollering at Jake,
"Get Blackie outta the house."

700
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,100
Jake has this ugly
old dog and he...

701
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,200
What am I doing?

702
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,100
You don't understand
a word I say.

703
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,400
Yagaichi.

704
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,400
Washakie: When the summer
moved into fall,

705
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,800
we would go to our winter home
to escape the heavy snows.

706
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,600
Yagaichi traveled with us
at a difficult time.

707
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,800
As the snow
came early that y ear,

708
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,500
the hunting grounds
were scarce.

709
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,600
We were forced
even further south,

710
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,000
to find the abundance
needed for our survival.

711
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,900
What is it?

712
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,400
Is what the sky
has told me.

713
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,600
(signaling)

714
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,900
So?

715
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,100
Crows come.
Fight.

716
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,500
Isn't that good?

717
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,500
I do not like fight.

718
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,200
No good comes.
But Crows

719
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,200
will take our horses,

720
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,500
our women. We do not keep
our horses, women,

721
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,100
we will die.

722
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,600
We must go,
make battle.

723
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:27,800
Nick: Morogonai,

724
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,700
I want you to have this,

725
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,000
for strength.

726
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,500
(horse whinnying)

727
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,800
(war cries)

728
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,200
(gunshot)

729
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,900
(horse whinnying)

730
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,000
Morogonai!

731
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,900
Morogonai!

732
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,900
Morogonai.

733
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,400
Morogonai?

734
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,900
Morogonai?

735
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,000
Morogonai.

736
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,100
(groaning)

737
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,200
I go now.

738
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,700
- No, I don't want you to go.
- I need go.

739
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,100
I need my father.

740
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,400
Stay here, I'm gonna
go get some help.

741
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,400
No, Yagaichi, no.

742
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,800
Yagaichi,

743
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,700
make a goodbye me now.

744
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,500
I am your friend,

745
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,100
always.

746
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,300
Morogonai.

747
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,800
Identify yourself.

748
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,200
Sylvester Wilson,
from Grantsville,

749
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:34,100
- Utah territory.
- You wouldn't be kin

750
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,600
- to Elijah Wilson?
- Yes, sir. He's my father.

751
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,600
All I ask is
to share your fire.

752
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,800
please, come.

753
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
You're more than welcome.

754
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,900
Man: May we offer you
some fish?

755
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,900
they're small,
but they're tasty.

756
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,800
Thank you, I'm fine.

757
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,800
It'd be a shame
to waste them.

758
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,800
We've already eaten, we'll
leave them for the varmints.

759
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,500
Well, if they'd
just go to waste.

760
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,700
Go ahead, do yourself up.

761
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,900
Thank you.

762
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,800
Thank you. To be honest,
I am still hungry.

763
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,900
So...

764
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,800
tell us, brother Wilson,

765
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,100
you look like...

766
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:37,000
you've been away from home
for quite a while.

767
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,700
N ear on to 18 months.

768
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,300
I'm searching for my brother.

769
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,800
Your brother?

770
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,600
We think the Indians took him
about two years ago.

771
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,900
Here,

772
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,700
wash it down with this.

773
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,600
Man #2: Which ones?

774
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,600
Don't know.
Can't find a trace of him.

775
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,700
Man #2:
Why would you continue?

776
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,600
Be cause...

777
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,400
I know he's out here.
I can feel it.

778
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,100
So what does this brother
of yours look like?

779
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,400
He'd be about 15 now.

780
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,200
Maybe near my height,

781
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,100
light colored hair,
blue eyes.

782
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,600
Man #2: Last fall we were up
in Wind River country,

783
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,500
up at Washakie's camp.

784
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:23,000
We saw a young boy
that appeared to be white.

785
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,900
He had light hair.
Didn't get a look at his eyes.

786
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,100
We weren't convinced
he was white.

787
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,200
He was wearing
tribal clothes.

788
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,200
Didn't look like he was
any kind of a prisoner.

789
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,300
Did you find out
his name?

790
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
No, didn't have
a chance to ask.

791
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,500
Why didn't you?

792
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,900
I'm sorry.

793
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,400
It's just that l...
It's been so long.

794
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,200
Where is
the Wind River country?

795
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,100
Pocatello!

796
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,600
This was it,
wasn't it?

797
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,700
You have good aim,
my brother.

798
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,700
I was aiming for his head.

799
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,500
Heard it in the wind,
Washakie.

800
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,900
Morogonai could read
the sky.

801
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,700
He knew what would happen to him
if he had to fight the Crows.

802
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,400
Morogonai is miss ed.

803
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,900
He would be
proud of you today.

804
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,700
You are a warrior now,
my brother.

805
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,300
I had council
with the elders today.

806
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,400
I know.

807
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,600
We are worried
about the posse.

808
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,000
I understand.

809
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,000
I know that I'm done here.

810
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,900
I must go back to my family.

811
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,700
I want to go back.

812
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,100
Do you understand?

813
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,300
The head understands,

814
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,600
the heart...

815
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,800
cannot speak.

816
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,700
Follow the River, it will
lead you back to your people.

817
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,100
I promise to return again
to see my Shoshone mother.

818
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,000
You will return.

819
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:40,900
Yagaichi.

820
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,100
(music) Many moons (music)

821
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,900
(music) have pass ed (music)

822
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,600
(music) Turn the page (music)

823
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,300
(music) As you look out and see (music)

824
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,200
(music) A world of adventure (music)

825
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,500

826
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,300
(music) When dreamers dream (music)

827
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,800
(music) The legend goes (music)

828
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,600
(music) The wind calls (music)

829
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,100
(music) Your name. (music)

830
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,000
What is it, Spirit?

831
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,100
Let's go!

832
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,100
(gunshot)

833
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,000
(war cry)

834
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,800
- Sylvester: I got you covered.
- Nick: And I have you covered.

835
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,800
You speak English?

836
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,800
Who are you?

837
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,800
I asked you first.

838
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,600
No, you didn't.

839
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,500
Nick?

840
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,800
Sylvester?

841
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,300
Yeah.

842
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,900
What the devil
are you doing up here?

843
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,400
Looking for you.

844
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:56,600
- You were looking for me?
- For two years.

845
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,900
Can you forgive me?

846
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,300
It's me that needs
to be forgiven.

847
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:16,900
I guess we're even then.

848
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:20,300
You know,
if we start riding now,

849
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,900
we could get a couple hours
closer to home before suns et.

850
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,100
Why you in such a hurry?

851
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:29,700
You're just going to have
to herd sheep and fix fences.

852
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,200
I think
I can handle that.

853
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,500
We're going home.

854
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,600
(children laughing)

855
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:33,400
Welcome home,
my young brother.

856
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,600
This is where our mother
wanted to be.

857
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,900
I promised I'd come back.

858
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:06,100
I'm just sorry...

859
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,600
I'm just sorry it wasn't...

860
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,300
while you were still alive.

861
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,300
(Nick sobbing)

862
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,100
You are still Yagaichi.

863
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Washakie: In 1857,

864
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,400
Yagaichi returned home.

865
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,900
He mended fences,
and plowed fields.

866
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,400
In 1861,

867
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,200
Nick Wilson went on to be come
one of the founders

868
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:53,200
