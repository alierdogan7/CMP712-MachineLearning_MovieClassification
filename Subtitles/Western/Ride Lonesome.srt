1
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,035
I hear him.

2
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,411
Mornin', Brigade.

3
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,886
I've been looking to find you, Billy.

4
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,194
I know. I've been seein' your dust
for three days.

5
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,128
I figured it better to let you catch up
and have it out'n over.

6
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,566
The others? Where are they?

7
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,403
They went on ahead.

8
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,980
I told 'em I'd be along

9
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,279
after I buried you.

10
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,181
Mount up. We're going back.

11
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,392
You know I can't do that.

12
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,519
It's the only thing you can do.

13
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,498
If I was to ride south with you,
there's them that'd see me hang.

14
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,035
You left a dead man in the street
in Santa Cruz.

15
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,334
- Fair fight.
- He was killed from behind.

16
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,237
Like the others.

17
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,174
I don't know how much they're paying you
to bring me in,

18
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,214
but it ain't near enough.

19
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,350
I'd hunt you free. Let's go.

20
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,097
I guess that makes me out a liar, don't it?

21
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,924
Them boys didn't go ahead.

22
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,201
They're scattered all in rocks.

23
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,832
There's no way for you to get outta here.

24
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,647
Now, look, Brigade,

25
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,646
I got no quarrel with you.

26
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:20,922
If you ride outta here,
I'd forget about this whole thing.

27
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,329
What's one more bounty to a man like you?

28
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,825
Money's got blood on it.

29
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,666
We're goin' on back.

30
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,000
You don't understand.

31
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,566
I give the word, you're dead.

32
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,645
Maybe. But before I hit the ground
I'll blow you half in two.

33
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,680
- You're bluffin'.
- Am I?

34
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,552
Call 'em off, Billy.

35
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,462
Hold your fire boys. It ain't gonna work.

36
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,399
I knew I should'a done it my way.

37
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,969
In the back?

38
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,441
Charlie!

39
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,910
Charlie!

40
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,470
You all find my brother Frank.

41
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,448
You tell him what's happened.

42
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,977
Tell 'em Ben Brigade's takin' me
to Santa Cruz.

43
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,018
You hear me, Charlie?

44
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,318
Well, you tell him that.

45
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,259
He'll know what to do.

46
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,495
Now, get goin'.

47
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,879
You better put them on tight.

48
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,781
Hop on.

49
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,264
You know my brother, Frank?

50
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,633
Heard of 'im.

51
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,532
Then I guess you know you ain't
gonna get me to Santa Cruz.

52
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,261
Wells Junction.

53
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,825
There's nobody out'n about.

54
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:57,001
You don't suppose Frank'n the boys
circled high around and are waitin' do you?

55
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,409
Let's see.

56
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,531
- Anybody home?
- Stay right there.

57
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,901
- Drop the gun.
- Better had.

58
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,756
Well, I'll be. Ben Brigade.

59
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,688
Hello, Boone.

60
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,826
Fancy runnin' into you in all this empty,

61
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,571
I saw you come up over that rise.
Couldn't quite make you out.

62
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,270
A man can't be too careful
in this part of the country.

63
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,869
You're a long way from home.

64
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,541
- No more than you.
- I can go back.

65
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:53,050
- You must be Billy John.
- So?

66
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,850
I heard a lot about you!

67
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,864
You ain't as small as I thought you'd be.

68
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:06,370
You staying for the night,
or going to Santa Cruz?

69
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,805
Did I say I was goin' to Santa Cruz?

70
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,805
Not in words.
I came through there a while back.

71
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,313
I heard that Billy John had killed a man.

72
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,809
The man knottin' tie rope
said it was murder.

73
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,679
- Where is the station man?
- He ain't here.

74
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,880
Had some of his animals loose-herded
up on that flat.

75
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,324
Went out this mornin' to gather 'em
before the Eastbound come through,

76
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,259
- but they beat 'em to it.
- Who's they?

77
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,129
Freeds, Mescaleros,
Sunday-school teachers, for all I know.

78
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,532
He went to find 'em.

79
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,127
- Left you here to tend the station?
- Not exactly.

80
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,194
Whit!

81
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,705
The woman, bring 'er out here.

82
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,971
Never mind.

83
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,210
Now you all get your horses
and ride on outta here.

84
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,582
Now, look, lady.

85
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,190
Just do like I say.

86
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,754
That's no way to act.

87
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,821
Me and Whit's been
doin' you a service, with your man away.

88
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,296
- Tell her we ain't here to harm her.
- Why are you here, Boone?

89
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,698
A man needs a reason
to ride this country. You got a reason?

90
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,935
Don't matter. I want you gone. All of you.

91
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,039
But ma'am, we can't do that.
Just up and ride off.

92
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,780
No tellin' when your man'll
find them horses'n get back.

93
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,848
Besides, woman ain't safe out here alone.

94
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,918
- She won't be alone.
- No?

95
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,353
No, the Westbound's comin'.

96
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,099
They're in a hurry.

97
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,998
Whit, fetch up them animals in the corral.

98
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,766
We can make up the team change
for the lady before we go.

99
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,633
I don't need your help.

100
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,768
No, but the folks on the coach do.

101
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,711
They ain't had a meal hot or square
since they left Santa Cruz.

102
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,372
If I were you I'd look to feed 'em.

103
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,991
I know what you're thinkin'.

104
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:14,597
You're thinkin' that me and Whit's been
sittin' here waitin' for the coach to pull in.

105
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,430
Waitin' to take off with the Fargo box
or somethin' pure awful like that.

106
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,465
- Well, you're wrong.
- Am I?

107
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,563
Plum.

108
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,101
Mescalero.

109
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,132
Don't come out here!

110
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,469
Nothin for a woman to see.

111
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,252
What call they got to do a thing like that?

112
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,651
Murder raid. That or they wanted the horses.

113
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,314
- Butchers.
- Boone, that dust boil.

114
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,287
You figure they drew off
when they sighted the station?

115
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,028
Looks that way. Enough of 'em,
they'll try to scald us out before dark.

116
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,568
Whatta we gonna do?

117
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,202
- Only thing we can, bury the dead and wait.
- Wait?

118
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,705
If they catch us in the open,
come night, we wouldn't have a chance.

119
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,040
We'll fort up in the station till morning.

120
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,646
What about Billy?

121
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,806
What about him?

122
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,442
Well, him sitting out there
between you and Santa Cruz,

123
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,713
kinda makes the hill
higher to climb, doesn't it?

124
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,687
You could swing north, take Billy to Bisbee.

125
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,087
- A rope's a rope.
- He's going to Santa Cruz.

126
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,261
- No matter what.
- No matter what.

127
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,145
If you ask me, it ain't Christian.

128
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,247
Covering these folks
without reading over them.

129
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,149
I don't know if it's gonna help them now.

130
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,212
Yeah.

131
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,520
- Whit.
- Yeah?

132
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,900
- I shouldn't think it like this.
- What?

133
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,062
Look out there.

134
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,641
War signs.

135
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,803
Well, we got a treaty with the Mescaleros,
ain't we?

136
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,608
Just words on paper.

137
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,545
Yes, we been gettin' along.

138
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,446
I knew a man once. Got along with his wife.

139
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,417
One day she up'n shot him.

140
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,546
Dead?

141
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,320
- But why?
- Got mad.

142
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,026
Mescalero, they're mad.

143
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,292
But we ain't done nothin' to 'em.

144
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,263
We're white. That's good enough. Come on.

145
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,325
Sam.

146
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,933
You figure Brigade knows why we're here?

147
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,841
Not yet.

148
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,972
Guess there ain't no way him
findin out, is there?

149
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,242
Only one.

150
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,783
I'm gonna tell him.

151
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,284
- Tell him?
- Tonight.

152
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,616
If I were you,

153
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,952
I'd hold onto that shovel...

154
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,482
...'cause likely as not we're gonna
be needin' it again. Soon.

155
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,668
- I make it three.
- Four.

156
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,843
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

157
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:23,245
My husband
should have been back by now.

158
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,850
He said he'd keep after as far as Dry Fork.

159
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,954
If he hadn't picked up the animals by then,
he'd double on back.

160
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,452
That would have put him here before dark.

161
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,389
He likely got cut off.

162
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,461
- He wouldn't leave me here alone.
- Not if he had a choice.

163
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,795
You think something's happened to him?

164
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,130
I didn't say that.

165
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,603
There's any number of reasons
for his not getting back.

166
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,369
Even if he found the horses he'd have
to loose-herd them clear here by himself.

167
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,533
Could take him half the night,
maybe longer.

168
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,071
He never shoulda gone.

169
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,305
You'd have him lose his animals
and not go after them.

170
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,977
Not talkin' about animals, talkin about you.

171
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,647
- Me?
- He left you alone.

172
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,945
I can take care of myself.

173
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,015
If you were mine, you wouldn't have to.

174
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,081
Meaning?

175
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,926
Meaning I'd never of brought ya here
in the first place. Nowhere for a woman.

176
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,761
Running a swing station
is my husband's job, Mr. Brigade.

177
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,994
He should find a better one.

178
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,938
Like bounty hunting, for instance.

179
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,607
You cook good coffee.

180
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,101
Mr. Brigade...

181
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,477
You'd better get some sleep.
We'll be leaving first thing come morning.

182
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,209
- Leaving?
- Three days'll put us in Santa Cruz.

183
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,272
But I...

184
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,320
If your husband's not back, we'll swing
toward Dry Fork, pick him up on the way.

185
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,355
- Well, I...
- Good night, Mrs. Lane.

186
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,155
Best cookin' I had in a long time.

187
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,710
Mighty handsome woman, Mrs. Lane.

188
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,575
Don't look like they're
gonna try us, does it?

189
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,621
- Brigade?
- Yeah.

190
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:19,729
You were sayin,
a man needs a reason to ride this country.

191
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,702
You were right.

192
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,831
I don't suppose you heard about the poster
they got out on Billy John.

193
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,097
Poster?

194
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:36,270
Gotten tacked to near every tree 'n stump
'tween here'n Rio Bravo.

195
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,877
Claims the territory'll grant amnesty

196
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,116
to anybody that brings Billy in.

197
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,457
You know you won't believe this.

198
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,721
But me'n Whit went near a week

199
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,662
before we found out what that word
amnesty meant.

200
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,490
A fella sellin' Bibles over in
Santa Cruz told us.

201
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,268
It means the law's willin' to drop
any and all charges it's got against a man.

202
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,373
All he's gotta do is turn the key on Billy.

203
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,840
I know that ain't the reason
you rode 'im down.

204
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,047
But that's why me and Whit's gonna
tag along with you.

205
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,046
We figured that when Billy's brother Frank,

206
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,549
hears that you're ridin' him
in to hang, he's gonna come killin'.

207
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,525
But, if anybody can get Billy
safe to Santa Cruz, it's you.

208
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,259
If I do.

209
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,772
Then there's only one man standin'
between me'n startin' life clean over.

210
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,808
Make doubly sure Whit
keeps that Winchester on Billy John.

211
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,379
We wouldn't wanna lose 'im, would we?

212
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,345
We sure wouldn't.

213
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,274
Brigade! Brigade!

214
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,079
We can't take those animals along.
It'd slow us down.

215
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,016
- But we're responsible...
- They'll eat their way to the next swing stop.

216
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,712
Time comes, you can pick them up there.

217
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,152
Got out that black for you to ride.

218
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,089
The sooner you get on it, the
sooner we'll get clear from here.

219
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,999
Don't look like you and Mrs. Lane
get along too well.

220
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,501
We'll stay on the stage road to Dry Fork.

221
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,867
- Dry Fork?
- Swing south from there.

222
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,428
That's the long way, ain't it?

223
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,736
- Gotta pick up the station man.
- Or what's left of 'im.

224
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,712
Whit's right. If he had been alive,
that fella'd be back by now.

225
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,212
We're goin' to Dry Fork.

226
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,778
Not right away we ain't. Look.

227
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,330
- What do they want?
- They'll get around to it.

228
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,741
- What's he doing?
- He wants to talk.

229
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,249
Stay here.

230
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,114
He's got a horse. Wants to make a trade.

231
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,783
For what?

232
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,656
You.

233
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,791
He said they'd been seein' you here.

234
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,662
He wants to take you for his squaw.

235
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,331
So what we do now?

236
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,597
- Play along with 'em.
- Play along with...

237
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,575
If we don't we're apt to stir up
every buck in the country.

238
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,633
Come on.

239
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,247
- Just do like I tell you.
- Brigade.

240
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,778
Can't abide to see a woman's hair
hangin' from a Mescalero war-lance.

241
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,020
I hope you know what you're doin'.

242
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,330
- He'll offer his trade. I'll turn him down.
- Then?

243
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,967
With any luck they'll ride off.

244
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,474
Out in the hills, try to figure how else
to get you away from us.

245
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,530
I see.

246
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,834
No matter what happens
don't break down in front of 'em.

247
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,402
If you do, they'll take it wrong. Shame 'em.

248
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,072
I don't scare easy, Mr. Brigade.

249
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,710
I hope not.

250
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,476
That tears it.

251
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,549
Looks like you won.

252
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,495
They'll be back if they want her bad enough.

253
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,631
I thought you didn't scare, Mrs. Lane.

254
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,732
That was my husband's horse.

255
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:53,374
Too bad about the woman. She sure
is takin' it hard.

256
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,853
I tried to tell her it wasn't for certain
her man was dead. She wouldn't listen.

257
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,860
The way they treated 'em on the
coach, I don't hardly blame her.

258
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:09,965
I can't get over the way them Indians
wanted to trade her for a horse.

259
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:14,164
If it'd be me, I'd give a whole herd.

260
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,698
She's about the best all over
good-lookin' woman I ever seen.

261
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,610
- She ain't ugly.
- She sure ain't.

262
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,984
You got a reason for stayin'
in this open country?

263
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,887
Seems to me you'd keep a hill close
to your back, considering.

264
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:35,393
The way I see it, brother Frank
can't be too far back.

265
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,826
Talk had 'im up Val Verde way.

266
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,490
Heard about Billy,
he wouldn't waste any time.

267
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,362
Likely ride out the night.

268
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,267
To do that,
it'd put 'im behind us even sooner.

269
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,935
Dobe Corral's just over that rise.
We're headin' there.

270
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,741
I don't think
Frank's gonna come along before...

271
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,644
I'm not talkin' about Frank.
I'm talking about Mescaleros.

272
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,181
Medicine country.

273
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:02,813
They figure to jump us up
it'll be somewhere soon.

274
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,718
Maybe them four at Wells Junction
went for more?

275
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,156
- I know they did.
- How can you be sure?

276
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,626
'Cause there they are.

277
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,991
Keep movin'.

278
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,198
You sure Dobe's just over that rise?

279
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,499
Positive.

280
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,671
Ain't we gonna hurry?

281
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,039
Yeah, now!

282
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,162
Move!

283
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,999
Take her out.

284
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,207
Get him!

285
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,206
Sure beats all, don't it?

286
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:21,047
What a man'll put himself through
to get his hands on a woman.

287
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,519
I can't blame 'im though.

288
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,748
Haul their dead to the crest of the hill.

289
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,790
- Does that hurt you?
- It'll be just fine.

290
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,129
Yes, ma'am. Better get it cleaned up.

291
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,558
There's five horses.
Musta' pulled out early this morning.

292
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:13,965
What we do now, Frank?

293
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,871
- We keep after them.
- But our animals are nearly dead.

294
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,740
Said we keep after 'em.

295
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:59,346
This'll keep the chill off.

296
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,680
Well, you can say thanks.

297
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,513
It just don't seem right.

298
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,586
What don't?

299
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,087
Brigade wantin' to stay the night here.

300
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,291
It seems he'd be more in a hurry
to get to Santa Cruz.

301
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:57,001
- Maybe he figures a Mescalero...
- No, it ain't that. It's somethin' else.

302
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,166
What?

303
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:07,977
I know it sounds crazy, but I think
he wants Frank to catch up.

304
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,987
- Catch up?
- The way he's been stickin' to open country.

305
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,623
Staying to the flat instead of the ridges.

306
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,793
Seemin' not to care whether
or not he's bein' followed.

307
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,060
But why would he want
to fool a thing like that?

308
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,035
I don't know.

309
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:35,506
Could be he figures it'd make it just
that much harder on us.

310
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,147
- On us?
- We're ridin' with 'im.

311
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:43,119
Frank might not hold kindly to that.
He could get us killed.

312
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,215
I never thought about that.

313
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,416
One way or the other, Brigade's
gotta face it out and he knows it.

314
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,664
Maybe we should forget about
the whole thing.

315
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,527
Ride away alive.

316
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,268
We can't do that.

317
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,640
- Lf Frank's goin' to come down here...
- You've been up north of Socorro?

318
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:15,580
- Some.
- I got a place up there.

319
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,520
- You got a place?
- It ain't much. Not yet, it ain't.

320
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,386
Got my herd to build, wire to
stretch'n such.

321
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,493
Only trouble is,

322
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,227
if I ride back there,
there's them that'll see me hang.

323
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,334
Unless, of course, the territory
was to drop the charge.

324
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,807
Oh, that word.

325
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,274
- Yeah, amnesty.
- Amnesty.

326
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,742
So, we get ole' Billy Boy back to Santa Cruz

327
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,508
and be just that close and never...

328
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,449
Never havin' to look over your shoulder
again and sleep with a gun in your hand.

329
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,454
Going off dead inside
when you see a man wearin' tin on him.

330
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,784
We just come too far, Whit.

331
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,458
Can't turn back now.

332
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,733
We just can't.

333
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,779
Will he be all right?

334
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,376
If I could get 'im on his feet he
would. The leg isn't broken.

335
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,785
- He can't get up?
- Won't.

336
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:02,519
Got it in his head he's down for good.
Hurts him to stand. Won't even try.

337
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,652
There's nothing you can do?

338
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,492
Stay with 'im. Let him know he's not alone.

339
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:17,067
I'm sorry about everything.
I know I'm a lot of trouble.

340
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,573
You... You took an awful chance out there.

341
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,949
Seemed like a good idea.

342
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,684
Hi, boy.

343
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,705
I guess I always knew.

344
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,035
- Knew?
- That it would end like this.

345
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,140
My husband didn't want me
to come out here.

346
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,778
Put in for a transfer the day
we took over the swing stop at the junction,

347
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,785
for a town job.

348
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,653
Every month it was supposed to
come through.

349
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,414
It never did.

350
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:11,256
I tried to tell myself it didn't matter,
that my place was with him.

351
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,526
Then I found myself
watching for coaches and hoping.

352
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,698
He must've noticed.

353
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,136
He asked me
to go on to Bisbee and wait for him.

354
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,730
Said I'd be safe there.

355
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,342
As much as I wanted to, I couldn't do it.
I couldn't leave him alone.

356
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:36,443
- He was a good man.
- Yes, ma'am, he'd have to be.

357
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:45,826
They told me why you're taking the boy
to Santa Cruz.

358
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,558
Did they?

359
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:51,324
- They'll hang him, won't they?
- Yes, ma'am.

360
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,428
- He's so young.
- He killed a man.

361
00:37:57,141 --> 00:38:01,077
- It doesn't bother you? Bringing him in.
- No, ma'am.

362
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,742
You just don't seem like the kind
that would hunt a man for money.

363
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,046
I am.

364
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,221
Good night, Mr. Brigade.

365
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,022
Mrs. Lane,

366
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,459
I made a place for you inside the wall.

367
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:29,563
- You'll be safe there.
- Thank you.

368
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,540
Good night.

369
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,213
She's sure something, ain't she?

370
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,011
Said she was married to that station fella
near a year.

371
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:31,386
Can you imagine having her around
all that time?

372
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,799
All them days. Nights.

373
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:43,498
Just thinking on it
gives me a way down shiver.

374
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,874
I wonder what she'll do now,
she's without a man?

375
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,482
Find another.

376
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:58,179
But if she loved that fella hard enough,
she'd stay a widow, wouldn't she?

377
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:04,656
Ain't the kind. Not her. Some are.
Some can get along without.

378
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:09,328
Not her. She's the kind that's got a need.

379
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,936
Deep lonely need only a man can get at.

380
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,464
How do you know?

381
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,041
I've seen it in her eyes.

382
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,024
In her eyes.

383
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,165
Is Brigade still trying
to get that animal up?

384
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,103
Yeah. He was at it all night.

385
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,163
Why doesn't he shoot him
and get it over with?

386
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,843
He said he wanted to wait.

387
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,539
He claims animals are like people.

388
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:01,346
Feel the morning sun on them
makes forget all the hurt they got.

389
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,648
Makes them want to start over.

390
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:09,054
There are sure times he doesn't act like
a man that makes his way killing.

391
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,627
Miss Lane.

392
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,127
Could I have a word?

393
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:29,305
Something you ought to know.

394
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,711
My brother, Frank,
he'll be along most any time now.

395
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,514
Won't anywhere be safe once he gets here.

396
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:41,750
And you being a woman,
I'd hate to see anything happen to you.

397
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,254
- Is that all?
- No.

398
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,198
No ma'am, what I was thinking was,

399
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:54,101
I'd see to it that Frank made it
right by you if you was to help me.

400
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,969
- Help you?
- Yes, ma'am. Yeah.

401
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,272
I've been watching Brigade
ever since the junction.

402
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,313
The way he looks at you, kind of hungry.

403
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,481
You shouldn't have any trouble
getting yourself close against him.

404
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:12,852
- Close enough to help me get safe away.
- I don't understand.

405
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,393
- Come on, sure you do.
- She said she didn't.

406
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,765
You can't blame a man for trying.

407
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,299
- Is this what you wanted her to get for you?
- I sure could use it.

408
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,038
We're moving out.

409
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,372
I'll be riding your horse.

410
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,111
- What am I suppose to do?
- Walk.

411
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,812
I don't think so.

412
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,249
You let me go.

413
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,590
If you don't, I'll swear I'll cut you in two.

414
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,895
No, you won't, Billy Boy.

415
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,835
Not unless you jacked that saddle gun.

416
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,896
That's my Winchester you got.
You pump a round into it, did you?

417
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,737
'Cause if you didn't,

418
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,903
you got a hammer hanging
over an empty chamber.

419
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,908
I shot myself in the leg once riding.

420
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,747
I never carried it around
under the pin since.

421
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,311
You're lying.

422
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,585
There's one way to find out.

423
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,588
Pull the trigger.

424
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,493
That is if you think you have time
to jack that gun

425
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,966
before I blow your brains out.
Go ahead, pull.

426
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:35,233
Or ain't you used to killing a man
from the front?

427
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,773
- You just put it down, Billy Boy.
- No.

428
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,775
I said, drop it.

429
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,300
I could've swore.

430
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,177
Looks like we don't
have to shoot him, either.

431
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,391
The woman, she's falling behind.

432
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,296
- Now, Boone, back there...
- Yeah?

433
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,627
Thanks for getting that gun
out of my middle.

434
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,462
I couldn't let him shoot you
without a chance.

435
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,627
Why? You'd have had Billy.

436
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,797
Never would've enjoyed being a free man
done you that way.

437
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:26,365
Thought maybe you was afraid
you might need me with Frank to catch up.

438
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,673
- It crossed my mind.
- I figured it did.

439
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,574
- Top of that hump, we'll be in Santa Cruz.
- We?

440
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,743
Look, Brigade.

441
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,618
You and me going against each other,
it just ain't right.

442
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,318
I said to Whit more than once,
I'd give most anything

443
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,383
if we could work out something
short of killing.

444
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,723
Such as?

445
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,225
Them dollars they're giving you
to bring Billy in.

446
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,790
I'll match them, double if you say.

447
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,967
It'll take me awhile, but I'll get it.

448
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,370
How? Stopping coaches? Killing?

449
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,739
- That's all over with.
- Is it?

450
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,109
Gotta be.

451
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,506
A man gets half way,

452
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:08,073
he ought to have something of his own
to belong to and be proud of.

453
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,585
- They say that.
- I've got me a place.

454
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,452
Gonna run beef. Work the ground.

455
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,458
Be able to walk down the street
like anybody.

456
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,224
All I need is Billy.

457
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:24,430
I set out to take him to Santa Cruz.
I full intend to do it.

458
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,369
Well, I just wanted you to know how it was.

459
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,962
Way I look at it,

460
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,976
it ain't near as hard for a man
if he knows why he's gonna die.

461
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:37,035
They stayed here the night.
Can't be more than a half a day ahead.

462
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:43,179
- That'd put them in Santa Cruz by morning.
- Could, but it won't.

463
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,744
Should have known all along.

464
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,082
Brigade knows we're after him.

465
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,987
But he's still taking his time

466
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:57,083
moving in the clear, not covering his tracks.

467
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,397
It's been plain from the first.
So plain I couldn't see it.

468
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,558
But I don't follow.

469
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,363
It ain't Billy he wants. It's me.

470
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,700
But Billy's the one with the bounty on him.

471
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:13,072
It ain't the money Brigade wants.
Not the money at all.

472
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:18,103
I did him a hurt once. Long ago.
So long I almost forgot.

473
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,511
And all the time I was thinking
that was why he was taking Billy in to hang.

474
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:25,851
To get even. That isn't it.

475
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:29,790
He knew I'd come after him.
He wants me to catch up.

476
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,920
And I think I know where.

477
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,594
Let's let the boys rest their horses.
There's no hurry. He'll be waiting.

478
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,472
Hang tree.

479
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,708
You can be glad it ain't long ago, Billy Boy.

480
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,613
It was, like as not Brigade here
to hang you over that jury limb

481
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:34,945
and have it over.

482
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:38,181
Gone dead now, but in its time,
more than one danced their last on that.

483
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,189
Ain't that right, Brigade?

484
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,690
- Brigade...
- I heard you.

485
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:46,160
Come to think of it,
you strung a few there yourself.

486
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:50,525
You talk too much.
We'll night at the river bed.

487
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,594
Touchy, touchy.

488
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:20,391
- Quit it.
- It's something to do.

489
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,693
I said, quit it.

490
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,541
Don't you ever get tired
of holding that gun on me?

491
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:38,411
It won't be long now.
I'll have you in Santa Cruz by morning.

492
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:44,917
Brigade figures to split
the bounty with you, does he?

493
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:48,151
- Nope.
- Then why are you helping him?

494
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,819
- I ain't.
- You're holding a gun.

495
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,419
- I got a reason.
- Such as what?

496
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,533
- Amnesty.
- Amnesty?

497
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,099
- Some word, ain't it?
- What's it mean?

498
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,171
Free.

499
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,436
Free?

500
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,979
That's what we'll go
as soon as we get you to Cruz.

501
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,515
Me and Boone.

502
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,153
We ain't always seen eye to eye to the law.

503
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:23,156
If we get you next to a rope,
it'll make us even. We can start over.

504
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,285
- Boone's got a place...
- Hey did you...

505
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:32,059
You mean they'd do that
just for bringing me in to hang?

506
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,270
We got a poster on it.

507
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,834
I guess that kind gives me a worth, don't it?

508
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,937
To us it does.

509
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,050
What about Brigade?

510
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:55,755
What about him?

511
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,690
He's the one that caught me.

512
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:03,062
I don't figure he's going to hold kind
to you taking me away from him.

513
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,560
I thought about that.

514
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,530
I thought about that a lot.

515
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,430
It really don't matter.

516
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,204
You ain't going to get me
to Santa Cruz anyway.

517
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,406
If Frank was coming,
he'd have been here by now.

518
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,642
Maybe.

519
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,517
It's a shame about that woman.

520
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:38,259
There's going to be a lot of killing
if Frank gets here.

521
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,666
Not knowing she's along,
you can't tell what's going to happen.

522
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:50,541
Frank wouldn't shoot a woman, would he?

523
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,142
Not only Frank. There's the boys.

524
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,214
I never thought about that.

525
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,678
Whit?

526
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,582
Whit.

527
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,025
Why don't you let the hammer down
nice and easy on that gun

528
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:08,064
and the two of us ride right on out of here.

529
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,188
Yeah.

530
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,098
You wouldn't want to see a woman
all shot up and dead, would you?

531
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,535
- Well, no.
- Well, then?

532
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:19,974
- Then what, Billy?
- You're every place, ain't you?

533
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,974
He was trying to talk me out of my gun.

534
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,610
Where's Mrs. Lane?

535
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,182
Down there by the river bank.

536
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,794
If he tries to talk that gun away
from you again,

537
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,262
let him have it.

538
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,320
Yeah.

539
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,676
- I didn't mean to startle you.
- I couldn't sleep.

540
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,686
I'm glad.

541
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,119
We'll be in Santa Cruz tomorrow, won't we?

542
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:17,565
If we get an early start,
we should be there by noon.

543
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,406
And what then, Mrs. Lane? For you, I mean?

544
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,235
I don't know. I'm not sure.

545
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,284
This country's nowhere for a woman
without a man.

546
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,626
I'd be obliged to look after you.

547
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,090
- I can manage.
- I'm sure of that.

548
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,800
The first I saw you at the junction,
I said to Whit,

549
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:59,308
"There's a woman
who can take care of herself. "

550
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,242
I saw it in your face.

551
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:06,942
The way you hold your head.
The way you walk.

552
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,382
All over proud of being a woman.

553
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,051
Not afraid to let a man look at you.
Think what he wants.

554
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,222
Burn inside to put his arms around you.

555
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:23,295
Not like some I know.
Always acting like it was Sunday.

556
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,494
Thinking every man who looks at them
wants them.

557
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,067
No, sir.

558
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:32,140
A man had you, Mrs. Lane,

559
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,606
he'd never know a black lonesome night.

560
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,521
- Good night, Mr. Boone.
- Mrs. Lane.

561
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,024
If you're counting on Brigade
being any help to you,

562
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,758
better forget it.

563
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,402
He won't be going all the way to Santa Cruz.

564
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,868
I got to kill him.

565
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:51,018
Hang tree. So that's what they call it.

566
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,919
Mr. Brigade,

567
00:59:55,992 --> 01:00:00,452
I try very hard, but there's some things
I just don't understand.

568
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,594
Back at Dobe,
when Billy had that gun on you,

569
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,762
- Boone saved your life, didn't he?
- Yes, ma'am.

570
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:13,439
Then why would he want to kill you now?

571
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,410
- He told you that?
- Yes.

572
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,149
- Why?
- He wants Billy.

573
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,207
Billy?

574
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,790
You mean you'd kill each other for bounty?

575
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:35,997
- Like two dogs fighting over a bone.
- You could say that.

576
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,392
- I see.
- No, ma'am, you don't.

577
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,860
It's not Billy I want
or any of the others I've had to ride down

578
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:45,499
to make my way on the one man I'm after.

579
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:50,945
And will he bring enough bounty
to see you through to your next dead man?

580
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,413
Mrs. Lane.

581
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,149
Long ago I was the Sheriff of Santa Cruz.

582
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,744
I rode Billy's brother Frank in for murder.

583
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,688
The jury found him part guilty,
sent him to Yuma.

584
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:06,218
He swore that when he got out
he'd get even. He was young, wild.

585
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,820
I had a wife. Looked a lot like you.

586
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,832
She wanted me to turn and run.
Keep running.

587
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,529
Pleaded with me. I couldn't do it.

588
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,769
Word came that Frank was out.
I waited for him in the street.

589
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,173
He didn't come.

590
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,270
When I got home, my wife had gone.

591
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:29,275
Frank had taken her. Brought her here.

592
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,376
- Here?
- Yes, ma'am.

593
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:33,921
He hung her.

594
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,482
Whit.

595
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,924
Get on that rise,

596
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,656
when you see dust, high end it back here.

597
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:17,522
- Sam.
- Yeah.

598
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,736
When are we going to kill Brigade?

599
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,574
- Soon.
- You know, I've been thinking,

600
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,741
he ain't a man you can go straight at.

601
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:38,149
We have to figure some way
to get him between us.

602
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:43,115
- Can't kill a man like Brigade from behind.
- We could stand off.

603
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,353
I don't hold to ending a man
with a long gun.

604
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,989
Don't worry, when the time comes,
I'll take care of him.

605
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,465
I hope so.

606
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,298
I hate to see you lose your place
up Socorro way.

607
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,897
- I'll be mighty proud to work for you.
- Work for me?

608
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:00,465
I plowed when I was young.

609
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:03,944
I ain't much with chickens,
but I can slop pigs with the best of them.

610
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:06,447
How long you and me been riding together?

611
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:09,349
- About two years.
- More like five.

612
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,609
So?

613
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:15,152
So you ain't going to be working for me.

614
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,625
You're going to be a partner.

615
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:24,165
- Partner?
- Right down the middle.

616
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,399
How come?

617
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,899
'Cause I like you.

618
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,002
I never knew that.

619
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,945
- Now get on that rise.
- Yes, sir.

620
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:07,032
I'd like to say it again, Mrs. Lane.

621
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,543
I'd be obliged to look after you.

622
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:14,544
I could help you bury Brigade
and live happy ever after, is that it?

623
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,582
There's some things
a man just can't ride around.

624
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:06,824
Hey!

625
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,561
Frank's coming!

626
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:15,072
- How far back?
- A mile, maybe less.

627
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,606
I saw him from the top of the rim.

628
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:22,617
- Do we cut and run, or don't we?
- This is as far as I go for now.

629
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,743
Figured it was.

630
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,185
Whit, look after Mrs. Lane.

631
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,280
Should have known it
when you wouldn't swing north to Bisbee.

632
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,381
It's been Frank all along.

633
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,688
- You... You wait...
- Shut up. I said shut up!

634
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:38,495
Last night I heard you tell Mrs. Lane
why you've been hunting for Frank.

635
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:39,591
So?

636
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,603
Billy can wait.

637
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,198
Me and Whit will be covering you
in the brush.

638
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,638
Look, Boone.

639
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,669
- This won't change anything.
- I never figured it would.

640
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:56,776
Get up on your animal, Billy.

641
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,116
- But I...
- Do like I tell you.

642
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,618
Look, Brigade.

643
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,097
You know you ain't got a chance.

644
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,155
One.

645
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,457
You.

646
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:17,563
What are you going to do?

647
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:19,970
That's up to Frank.

648
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,287
That's close enough.

649
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,730
You're fixing to have a little hanging I see.

650
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:28,641
I thought that tree would be dead and down
by now.

651
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,470
Cut him loose.

652
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:38,111
- You're standing alone.
- I wouldn't count on it.

653
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:43,422
- He's got two Winchesters behind him.
- Is that so?

654
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:55,201
- So what do we do now?
- Sit there and watch your brother hang.

655
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,771
- You don't mean that.
- Don't I?

656
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:01,304
- He's only a boy.
- He's as old as his gun.

657
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:05,336
It's me you're after.
You got no quarrel with Billy.

658
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,939
What quarrel did you have with her?

659
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:11,679
That was a long time ago. I'd almost forgot.

660
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,985
- A man can do that.
- Don't let him do it, Frank.

661
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,358
I done you enough. Don't make me kill you.

662
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:30,469
- I can't let you do that.
- Stop me.

663
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:35,176
Any shooting and that horse will go
right out from under Billy.

664
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,769
If his neck don't snap,
you can cut him down in time.

665
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,145
That is, if you're alive.

666
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:43,014
You don't leave a man much choice,
do you?

667
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,676
I thought for a minute
you were gonna let him swing.

668
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,238
So did I.

669
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,647
Brigade.

670
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,683
I don't suppose there's any way
of getting Billy from you?

671
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,815
Aside from going over you?

672
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,492
Come and get him.

673
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:59,519
Better get Whit to catch up Billy's horse,
unless you want him to walk to Santa Cruz.

674
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,933
You mean I can have him?

675
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:08,567
Take him. I got no more use for him.

676
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:20,145
You heard what he said, Whit!
Get them horses!

677
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,283
Yes, sir.

678
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:32,925
Funny how a thing can seem one way,
and then turn out altogether something else.

679
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:37,659
You said you wanted to start over.
I hope so.

680
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:41,829
'Cause if you don't, I'll be the one
who comes looking to find you.

681
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,837
- I'll remember that.
- Good luck.

682
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,745
Mr. Brigade.

683
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,942
- Will you be going on to Santa Cruz?
- No, ma'am.

684
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:00,448
- I think I understand.
- I figured you would.

685
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,187
Good bye, Mr. Brigade.

686
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:37,585
Well, that figures.
