But you might not be Mesito.

5
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,673
The Mesito from whom I heard
was a man.

6
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:11,648
Not a keeper of hens.

7
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,349
That's better.

8
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:18,768
Ehh, you animal!

What kind of work?

13
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:31,392
You'll know when we are

Is the Dutch?

15
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:38,705
Yes, I was commissioned to come and see you and you

Are you deaf?

18
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:56,629
Finally, it was time!

19
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,260
I have already fired.

20
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:21,438
Three.

21
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:22,712
You?

22
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,338
I just want one.

23
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,985
- Do you?
- Give me three, but they are good.

24
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,844
What do you, friend?

00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,320
I want two gentlemen.

26
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:39,883
I feel that it's going to win.

Still have not won,
and I speak first.

29
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:47,295
You will need to put 4 weights
if you want to see me.

30
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:53,733
- Augustus.
- No, not now.

31
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,283
Vah, is too much for me!

00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,701
I will not.

00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,082
- Where is it?
- In Mexico.

00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:13,866
You talk, man.
Do you play or not?

39
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:17,284
What kind of work?

40
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,939

This is a terrible moment!

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,664
Ehh!
Hey what are you doing?

73
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,672
You can not leave!

74
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,439
Have a contract with me!

75
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,539
That's where we expect the Dutch.

76
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,451
Bring out the prisoner!

77
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,975
Platoon!

00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,874
Forward!

81
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,501
Silence, damn!

82
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,367
Get up, dog!

83
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:03,438
Silence!

84
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,030
Rascals!

85
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,216
To the wall, soon!

86
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:16,015
Ready!

87
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:20,411
Aim!

88
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,094
Mesito!

89
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:12,803
There seems nothing serious.

90
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,112
Will heal soon.

91
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,586
Thanks, my friend.

92
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:35,512
Still not what I'm here,
and I've won a battle.

93
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:41,300
Long time no see, Captain.

94
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:43,182
Too, Dutch.

95
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,995
Thanks for coming, samurai.

96
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:50,412
Luis,
good job.

97
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:54,420
Hello, old Dutchman!

98
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:57,795
And this why?

99
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,734
When I tell you to come, come.
I need you alive, not dead.

100
00:17:01,918 --> 00:17:03,028
Okay, Dutch.

101
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,247
Although you have a very rare
greeting.

102
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:13,660
Years have passed, but you do not
have changed, Dutch.

103
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:18,908
Then you will not need to remind you
he who gives orders here I am,

104
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,573
and I'm willing to do anything to get it.
Is it clear?

105
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,439
There is something that is not what it looks in
that old Mexican in there?

106
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,322
Is what we pay.

107
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:30,738
We work for him.

108
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:34,862
But is that how you will give us $ 1000 per head?
A peasant!

109
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:40,192
For your information, the farmer knows where
gold is worth half a million dollars

110
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:42,546
just waiting
apoderemos we it.

111
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,059
A bank?

112
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,009
Not exactly.

113
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,188
A bank on wheels.

114
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:55,651
A train. A nice train
with a rich cargo.

115
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:19,109
Well folks, now eat.

116
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:31,576
Well, now tell us what's
that train laden with gold.

117
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:34,434
What matters, is a train!
It will be easy.

118
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:38,361
You may not opine you so
when you know how that train.

119
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,191
I do not care.

120
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:44,117
For half a million dollars by me
his back and I'll take it myself.

121
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,798
No, not that simple, Luis is right.
Is not a train either.

122
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,760
- Not be easy.
- What's so special?

123
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,171
I'm going to explain.

124
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:57,032
Toma.

125
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:59,491
First, the locomotive.

126
00:21:00,454 --> 00:21:02,690
Immediately
a closed van.

127
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:05,942
- I do not see the difficulty.
- Full of soldiers.

128
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:09,275
- Soldiers?
- After an open car with 2 machine guns.

129
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:10,880
And with more soldiers.

130
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,637
Nobody told me you had to
faced with an army.

131
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:15,324
Next is our coach.

132
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,705
Fully shielded.

133
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,377
And within it, 8 armed men guarding
jealously half a million dollars in gold.

134
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:28,184
- And finally, another open wagons.
- With more guns.

135
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:30,439
No friend, no,
with a cannon.

136
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:35,331
You've gone mad, Dutch.
You need to wise men, not us.

137
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,367
No, you are exactly
men need.

138
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,524
But, hey, how can we solve
the canyon for example?

139
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,229
Vah, do not worry friend!
The Dutchman has it all planned.

140
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:53,161
Listen you do not stop to smile and say
Amen to everything, and still do not know who you are.

141
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,389
What does it matter who I am?
The important thing is what I am.

142
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:57,889
What are you?

143
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,471
Young, for example.

144
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:01,676
Enough to not be afraid!

145
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:02,624
What did you say?

146
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:04,081
Simply, freeze!

147
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:07,317
Let go, Mesito!
And you, Luis, keep your mouth shut!

148
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:10,736
None of these men will lie behind
when the time comes.

149
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:20,086
Well, it's time to
you may know each other.

150
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:23,665
As I am the only one who knows all,
I will make presentations.

151
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:31,447
Augustus, spent five years together
in the army. Captain Benet and me.

152
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,379
The genius of dynamite,
they called it.

153
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:36,318
He was able to fly anything and say
a few pieces would be reduced.

154
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:42,556
During the War of Cuba, entrusted
fly the mission of Fort Manareta.

155
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:46,273
It was a good job,
blew up the fortifications, the arsenal,

156
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:47,989
and to the safe
Cuban army.

157
00:22:48,623 --> 00:22:49,787
And then he escaped.

158
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:52,715
The United States Army
even goes looking for him.

159
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:57,715
Now Mesito. It was not for money
so it got into difficulties.

160
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
But for food.

161
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:01,680
400 head of cattle to be exact.

162
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:06,073
Anyway, did not agree with the
pay given to him as rail,

163
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:09,396
and stole a train of meat
ready for sale.

164
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:13,815
The trouble was that man who tried
sell was the same owner.

165
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,432
You will not need to say that he was caught
and jailed.

166
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:19,908
Two weeks later escaped.

167
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:21,666
And walk fugitive.

168
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,130
Caring for chickens.

169
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,525
I told you to shut up.

170
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:30,541
The samurai.

171
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,964
Exalted master in handling the sword.

172
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:36,834
And in the release of knife.

173
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:43,511
Fled the country the night with his sword
6 men was sliced ​​in 4 seconds.

174
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:45,369
In three seconds, sorry.

175
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:46,574
Does not talk much.

176
00:23:47,397 --> 00:23:49,390
But when it acts,
do not fuck around.

177
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,665
Once they interpreted jeans
its silence as cowardice ...

178
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,114
began to sneer at his slanted eyes.

179
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,047
And eight of them settled before
that no one would notice.

180
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,509
What about the boy?

181
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:02,811
What can you do?

182
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:07,650
Louis. Luis Dominguez,
of Trapecistas Dominguez.

183
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:09,755
Circus acrobats.

184
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,492
Mom and Dad Dominguez
and his son Luis.

185
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:17,441
Only one night Dad fell from 3
0 m.
without a net and that's the number.

186
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:19,142
Luis found himself without work,

187
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:23,334
and found that robbing banks was
which was more on account.

188
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,093
The trouble was that he threw down the gauntlet
several times.

189
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,396
The first had it locked
6 months.

190
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:28,506
The second 6 weeks.

191
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:30,681
- And the third Louis?
- 6 minutes.

192
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:33,878
Yes, it sold off the two guards
who carried him prisoner.

193
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:36,347
His portrait now walks
all over the walls of Mexico.

194
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:54,011
Now, will you tell us what
your plan to seize on that train?

195
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,114
No time for that, I will tell
during the trip.

196
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
For how the trip?

197
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:58,499
Yes, the New World.

198
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:02,587
We start now.

199
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:24,459
Why leave all?

200
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:28,056
After the killing of soldiers
Do you want to stay?

201
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:43,190
Thank you. During the first stage
trip, join us.

202
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,962
When we part,
carry them with you.

203
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:02,017
If they had the height,
better simulate that go with your family.

204
00:29:56,181 --> 00:29:57,756
Why will you not,

205
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:00,153
but when I take my hand
that half a million ...

206
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,865
When I have my $ 1,000!

207
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:08,063
You know what I'm going to spend?

208
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:10,987
Let me guess.

209
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:15,232
Probably in a top hat,
an elegant ruffled shirt,

210
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:17,886
and one of those lace handkerchiefs
who get into the sleeve.

211
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:20,181
You have not given one, Dutch.

212
00:30:20,412 --> 00:30:21,724
I thought I knew your tastes.

213
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:26,414
Well, that proves you can never
boast of getting to know a man.

214
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:31,850
Come on, no joke. You know that
I am not one of those smug.

215
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:36,196
I'll join with 200 head of cattle.
But honestly now!

216
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,765
- I can give you some advice?
- Of course.

217
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,632
Buy yourself something you can not eat.

218
00:30:52,013 --> 00:30:55,405
What? Are you going YOU ARE
nervous as old maids?

219
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,746
Do not start again, Luis.

220
00:30:58,084 --> 00:30:59,254
How about out there?

221
00:31:00,222 --> 00:31:03,322
If the guard duty of Augustus
is as quiet as mine,

222
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,493
will have to work hard
to stay awake.

223
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,974
Anyway, not who
hell could discover here.

224
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:13,735
We are alone with cacti and wind.

225
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:17,023
I do not trust, since General Huertas
came to power,

226
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:18,837
soldiers are lurking
everywhere.

227
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:23,040
Have you heard? What do you think?
And speaks to me of soldiers!

228
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,526
He is not stupid enough to let
captured by them three times.

229
00:31:28,831 --> 00:31:30,928
Neither I was stupid enough to sell
its owner ...

230
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:31,933
Just the two!

231
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:35,209
KEEP weapons
for when the case!

232
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:38,250
He believed that there would
need to shoot.

233
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:39,859
Did not you have a plan?

234
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,063
And I have it, but in any plan
complications can occur.

235
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:44,378
Complications?

236
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:47,181
Do you begin to doubt the result perhaps?

237
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:52,339
I have not hesitated in my life.

238
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:56,293
And do not come if you had done was not
sure my plan will succeed.

239
00:31:57,103 --> 00:32:01,749
Dutch, you know me.
I'm a little slow when it comes to thinking.

240
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,648
And there is something that has me on tenterhooks.

241
00:32:03,653 --> 00:32:06,101
Still have not said how
is the work!

242
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:11,669
That half a million gold send it to
General Huertas some friends in Europe.

243
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:15,538
It's kind of contribution to
protect their interests here.

244
00:32:16,116 --> 00:32:20,376
If gold does not come to Mexico City, will
to give many axplicaciones their masters.

245
00:32:21,882 --> 00:32:24,864
What this pint in the old peasant
Morales Town?

246
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:28,913
The old farmer is Manuel Esteban, a
of the leaders of the revolutionary forces.

247
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:32,851
Wants to take the gold to buy
weapons and ammunition.

248
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:38,424
What we expected environmental apoderemos
million to deliver it later?

249
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,142
You said it, buddy.

250
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
That expected.

251
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:08,830
Luis Dominguez.

252
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:17,404
Well, Dominguez.
I waited a long time now.

253
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:25,109
I'm Captain Gutierrez
and have been caught in my jurisdiction.

254
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,834
I must warn you that as you were
found in the company of rebels,

255
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:36,135
I suppose you are rebels,
You know what happens in these cases?

256
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:38,417
You shall be shot!

257
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:42,909
Except you, Dominguez.

258
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:48,804
You,
you will be hanged slowly.

259
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:53,945
If you want to release for you,
you have to tell me your names,

260
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,864
What were you doing with those rebels,
what you came to Mexico,

261
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:00,654
who called you,
and who gave you hospitality.

262
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:02,136
That's it.

263
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:13,623
Be advised that I have tried
with many stubborn

264
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:15,432
and perhaps more stubborn than you.

265
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,733
All ma sooner or later
have spoken.

266
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:20,758
Some after several days
without sleep.

267
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:23,152
Other for leaving them without water.

268
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:26,217
And others having lost an eye.

269
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:29,371
When the Captain is in a good mood
torture her mother.

270
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:37,224
Do not listen to your friend.

271
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:39,945
Is doomed.

272
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:43,152
While you can you
stay alive.

273
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,699
Come on.
Speak!

274
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:51,262
What do you think, Captain?

275
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:54,960
Had not ever come
with real men?

276
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:15,369
Take them away!

277
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:21,277
I will give some time for you to think
how to save his skin.

278
00:35:33,956 --> 00:35:34,956
Ehh, you!

279
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:36,834
Bring these men!

280
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:40,204
Tie them to the sticks!

281
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:46,272
No!

282
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:48,661
No!

283
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:57,176
Go! There is a romance
between Japanese and the girl.

284
00:35:57,762 --> 00:35:58,762
Forward!

285
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,133
Stop!

286
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,762
Left!

287
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:32,427
Attention!

288
00:36:34,962 --> 00:36:35,962
Load!

289
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:39,486
Aim!

290
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:41,602
Fire!

291
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:47,289
In!

292
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,878
Sentinel!

293
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,292
Dominguez is dying.

294
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,451
Was it the blow to the head.

295
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:41,688
He's dying!

296
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:48,205
Back!

297
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,450
Back!

298
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:13,110
Mesito!
Take the gun.

299
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:15,577
And when the shooting starts,
salt firing.

300
00:40:48,202 --> 00:40:49,771
A thin sheet of steel.

301
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:53,110
Too beautiful
East for a vile.

302
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:58,854
The saber will keep to use as a gala
when I make general.

303
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:02,962
Is not it good idea?

304
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:08,716
Of course if I get to find out what
have come to do in Mexico these men,

305
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,135
could ...

306
00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:16,871
show my gratitude setting free
the eyes oblique, and his companions.

307
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:21,423
Ohh!
How much loyalty!

308
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:26,877
You do not want to reveal his secret even
that this could cost you your life and yours.

309
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:32,977
Note that heroism
is a man, girl!

310
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:39,115
It is much easier to persuade
a woman to forget her ideals.

311
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:40,181
Much ...

312
00:41:41,744 --> 00:41:43,178
Much easier

313
00:41:44,357 --> 00:41:46,454
And much more enjoyable.

314
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,921
For pity's sake!
No!

315
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:56,772
Out of here!

316
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,666
Thank you.

317
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:59,426
Well, here we parted.
Return to your people.

318
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,360
I leave with a gun, you know
how it handles.

319
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:08,040
And do not worry,
soldiers will follow us.

320
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:50,951
Stephen!
We are friends of Manuel were!

321
00:45:52,909 --> 00:45:54,352
Soldiers chase us!

322
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:57,385
We take care of it.

323
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,006
Maybe I'm wrong, but not
can cope with all these soldiers.

324
00:46:58,712 --> 00:47:00,265
I know, and they know it too.

325
00:47:00,707 --> 00:47:02,826
But resist
to give us time to flee.

326
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:04,179
It will cost them their lives!

327
00:47:05,775 --> 00:47:07,898
Yes, kill them all.
We also know it.

328
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,991
And are willing to die for nothing?
They must be crazy!

329
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:14,126
There are men who die for money,
others for a cause.

330
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,268
And they die for us.

331
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,272
Breathe
for each one of us.

332
00:47:44,005 --> 00:47:48,335
- Impossible!
- We shall see. Take a look down there.

333
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:52,460
What the hell is that?

334
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,500
The train of exploration.

335
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:58,418
Precedes the other in 20 minutes and check
if there is damage on the tracks

336
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,597
or explosive charges.

337
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:02,722
If you find any obstacle alerts
immediately to our train.

338
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:05,604
Have you seen enough?

339
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:16,392
Dutch, are you sure
you get it?

340
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:19,034
Never be sure until the
work is finished.

341
00:48:19,304 --> 00:48:20,304
For me over.

342
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,599
I retire.

343
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:27,081
That could not work out or a month
time and we have only 4 days.

344
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,633
No, we only have three.

345
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:32,223
I do not like Dutch!

346
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Why not?

347
00:48:35,385 --> 00:48:38,925
You have a plan. It will be good,
but not for that train.

348
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,862
Listen to me! My plan is on paper
and result in practice!

349
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:47,179
Now the train is going for gold, within
3 days we take possession of half a million.

350
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:50,582
To give to the revolutionaries,
of course.

351
00:49:14,296 --> 00:49:17,505
The next time you see it,
be ours.

352
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:46,226
Sorry gentlemen, this bandit
tried to rob me.

353
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:47,907
But I managed to capture him.

354
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:49,742
Do you want to take him prisoner?

355
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,692
Dutch,
What about that house?

356
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,238
Is abandoned
As the station.

357
00:51:56,567 --> 00:51:58,384
These rails seem
in good condition.

358
00:51:59,047 --> 00:52:01,964
Instead the ties are broken
as crackers.

359
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:06,692
That does not think any more than food.

360
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,391
How much do you think can they hold?

361
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:16,436
The passage of a wagon once or twice.

362
00:52:16,893 --> 00:52:19,571
Well, enough said.

363
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,230
Enough of shooter!

364
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:11,436
- To hit the target there is nothing like this.
- Nobody hears you shoot the pots.

365
00:53:12,373 --> 00:53:15,471
But along the train route is
platoons of soldiers every 6 miles ...

366
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:17,617
willing to intervene
the first shot.

367
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,581
And do not forget the soldiers
going in the cars.

368
00:53:21,555 --> 00:53:22,555
Keep working.

369
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:34,751
I ordered a Mesito
I did them.

370
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,435
I hope these will coviertas
to reduce the noise.

371
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:41,686
Operate with dynamite
like a cannon.

372
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,642
I have not given a full charge, but
will give you an idea of ​​how it works.

373
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,618
It works great!

374
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,053
Keep worrying about noise.

375
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:12,406
Do not worry, you can cover your
with the train whistle.

376
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:16,460
How about Captain?
Will he all right?

377
00:54:17,638 --> 00:54:21,080
I'm too old to think, well
you're the one who calls the shots.

378
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:24,525
But if you want my opinion,
I think they'll kill us all.

379
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:29,510
It's not like before, Dutch,
when you and I were together there.

380
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:34,062
No more ...
romantic adventures.

381
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,999
Reflect. Today we are only 4 old and
a boy against at least 100 soldiers.

382
00:54:41,343 --> 00:54:43,238
Against an armored train.

383
00:54:43,507 --> 00:54:46,136
Against a cannon that can be turned off
a candle to 5 km

384
00:54:46,406 --> 00:54:50,322
5 men against guns
and automatic rifles.

385
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:53,186
Before there were all those things.

386
00:54:54,202 --> 00:54:56,372
We finished, and you know it.

387
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:58,496
Then why did you accept?

388
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,313
Because we are already dead
long.

389
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:06,925
Our time has passed.

390
00:55:07,273 --> 00:55:08,273
He left.

391
00:55:08,694 --> 00:55:10,180
Look at me for example.

392
00:55:10,832 --> 00:55:14,036
After leaving the army
I became a professional player.

393
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,877
He played very well before.

394
00:55:18,087 --> 00:55:21,716
But when you've spent years manipulating
dynamite feel inside ...

395
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,990
as a vacuum.

396
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:27,336
It is what it is, but do not let live.

397
00:55:27,945 --> 00:55:30,403
And suddenly,
when you marcándote a bluff,

398
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:34,568
hand ... you and trembles
sweat like hell.

399
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:38,779
So I ended up plucking
the poor devils.

400
00:55:42,035 --> 00:55:45,859
And the others are no better. Mesito no longer
knows what he is sleeping in a bed.

401
00:55:46,225 --> 00:55:50,383
The samurai throwing knives in a shack
fair for a dollar a day.

402
00:55:51,627 --> 00:55:54,111
And Louis ...
Who is Louis?

403
00:55:54,212 --> 00:55:56,504
A petty criminal
like a hare.

404
00:55:57,614 --> 00:56:02,636
And you yourself, Dutch. A man without a country
the service of these ragged.

405
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:07,735
No, my case ...
is different.

406
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,311
Different?

407
00:56:10,795 --> 00:56:12,435
No, we are all equal!

408
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,967
So we have embarked
in this case.

409
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:20,016
This time we cleared them all.
Everyone!

410
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:22,929
And you know it.

411
00:57:23,845 --> 00:57:24,845
Samurai ...

412
00:57:25,674 --> 00:57:27,435
Shoes, belts and what knives?

413
00:57:32,661 --> 00:57:33,661
Very good.

414
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:35,731
Louis.

415
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:40,344
Shoes, belts,
and handle.

416
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:41,710
And the clock?

417
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:52,745
Shoes, belts, fuses, covers,
cable channels, what about the dynamite?

418
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:57,788
It appears that you have everything.

419
00:57:58,185 --> 00:57:59,416
Except encouragement.

420
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:01,442
There, you will, Captain.

421
00:58:03,348 --> 00:58:04,348
Mesito.

422
00:58:05,304 --> 00:58:08,120
- Is this what it is?
- To let us all a drink.

423
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:10,502
Save it for when we
something to celebrate.

424
00:58:10,525 --> 00:58:11,525
Is the clock?

425
00:58:11,814 --> 00:58:13,618
- Huh?
- Do you watch?

426
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:15,839
- Ah, I have.
- Let me see it.

427
00:58:16,153 --> 00:58:17,428
- I have it!
- Show me!

428
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:40,518
Cuélgatelo neck, so you may not have
sit on top of it.

429
00:58:40,703 --> 00:58:41,783
Come on, put it on.

430
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:42,971
Instructions.

431
00:58:43,693 --> 00:58:46,568
- Again!
- Yes, again and as many as fit.

432
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:51,672
20 minutes for open wagons.
3 minutes to move from car to car.

433
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:54,870
5 minutes for contingencies.
Total 34 minutes.

434
00:58:57,192 --> 00:58:58,192
Mesito.

435
00:58:59,398 --> 00:59:03,725
At 6:45 the train of exploration.
20 minutes after the convoy.

436
00:59:04,068 --> 00:59:07,604
I have 20 minutes to attach the rails
and changing needles.

437
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:09,598
All in 20 minutes.

438
00:59:09,604 --> 00:59:10,893
They are more than enough.

439
00:59:11,316 --> 00:59:13,431
Not when the last
that fit one of life.

440
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:23,705
Places, everyone!

441
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:49,336
Come down!

442
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Get in!

443
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:00,985
- There he is!
- Half a million dollars.

444
01:01:01,463 --> 01:01:02,463
Now!

445
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:19,619
Attention!

446
01:01:26,538 --> 01:01:27,538
Attention!

447
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,980
Attention!

448
01:02:09,598 --> 01:02:11,104
Exit the train of discovery!

449
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,330
Raise the escort!

450
01:03:28,212 --> 01:03:29,264
Guard to train!

451
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,822
Lord Mayor.
Lady.

452
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,634
- Have you come to see the train?
- Yes, Captain.

453
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:53,725
Kindly.

454
01:03:54,011 --> 01:03:56,939
As you can see is well protected.
Heavily armed.

455
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,597
General Huerta has thought of everything.

456
01:03:59,957 --> 01:04:03,331
Even men have been
carefully chosen by their officers.

457
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:06,341
All guarantees absolute security.

458
01:04:06,964 --> 01:04:09,037
- Do not you think, Mr. Mayor?
- Yes, of course, Captain.

459
01:04:09,398 --> 01:04:11,168
This is the car of gold.

460
01:04:11,445 --> 01:04:14,259
Apart from the armed escort
traveling inside ...

461
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,515
is externally protected by a
sand-filled cushion.

462
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:19,870
Impressive.

463
01:04:43,064 --> 01:04:44,724
Present arms!

464
01:09:48,418 --> 01:09:49,418
Peter!

465
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:07,602
What will you do?

466
01:10:07,607 --> 01:10:09,702
I do not want that gold
General Huerta arrives.

467
01:10:10,622 --> 01:10:12,727
- Is it against Huerta?
- Right.

468
01:10:12,732 --> 01:10:14,789
Then I help, I
I'm with the Revolution.

469
01:10:15,971 --> 01:10:18,109
- What about your partner?
- He is with them.

470
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:20,683
Maybe tell me the truth,
but might not.

471
01:10:26,123 --> 01:10:27,335
Do not do stupid things.

472
01:13:43,543 --> 01:13:44,859
Hey, look!

473
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:03,706
What is it, Captain?

474
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:05,638
Hurry!

475
01:20:06,264 --> 01:20:07,464
I can not do.

476
01:20:12,395 --> 01:20:13,395
Why not?

477
01:20:14,008 --> 01:20:15,559
I dropped a cover.

478
01:20:16,538 --> 01:20:17,752
And you can not do without it?

479
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,633
Sure! Want to hear the explosion
up in Mexico City?

480
01:20:22,124 --> 01:20:24,122
Or that stifle the noise
with your hands?

481
01:20:25,639 --> 01:20:29,632
Listen genius!
You will blow up loads!

482
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:31,289
I do not care how!

483
01:20:31,611 --> 01:20:34,603
I do not care who loses a hand,
or half-face!

484
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:38,518
Lieutenant!

485
01:21:40,683 --> 01:21:42,375
Lieutenant, here is water!

486
01:22:01,063 --> 01:22:02,063
Refrésquense!

487
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:36,085
Take!

488
01:31:38,179 --> 01:31:40,933
Inside these guns or I'll shoot
one on!

489
01:31:41,478 --> 01:31:43,549
Throw them down!
And raise your hands!

490
01:32:30,267 --> 01:32:31,267
Now?

491
01:32:31,902 --> 01:32:32,902
No, not yet.

492
01:32:33,363 --> 01:32:35,679
We will provide when we get to ...
where we go.

493
01:32:36,341 --> 01:32:38,691
Everyone knows the path to take.
So on!

494
01:32:38,805 --> 01:32:40,234
Mesito!
Go into the truck!

495
01:32:40,251 --> 01:32:42,156
Luis!
Tie them in that corner!

496
01:32:42,161 --> 01:32:43,818
While the gold charge.
Come on!

497
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,240
Ah, come on!

498
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:14,813
Come on, give me a hand!

499
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:39,791
Mesito!
Are you okay?

500
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:41,955
Beautifully!

501
01:34:46,133 --> 01:34:47,133
One for me,

502
01:34:48,675 --> 01:34:50,368
One for the Dutch and Luis.

503
01:34:52,313 --> 01:34:53,969
Augustus and the samurai.

504
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:57,510
One for me.

505
01:35:07,117 --> 01:35:08,529
He is very busy.

506
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,710
One for Augustus and the samurai.

507
01:35:12,401 --> 01:35:13,401
One for me.

508
01:35:14,254 --> 01:35:15,885
One for the Dutch.
Louis.

509
01:35:19,037 --> 01:35:20,664
Augustus and the samurai.

510
01:35:26,278 --> 01:35:29,157
- Come on, cut the jokes!
- I'm not kidding.

511
01:35:53,388 --> 01:35:55,055
Hebérmelo had figured.

512
01:35:55,955 --> 01:35:57,001
Stand there, Mesito!

513
01:36:01,097 --> 01:36:02,593
Louis reloads in the truck.

514
01:36:07,122 --> 01:36:08,282
Have you imagined?

515
01:36:08,601 --> 01:36:11,599
- Why not?
- Because I'm so stupid like you.

516
01:36:16,215 --> 01:36:19,265
You can not take it all, Dutch!
All no!

517
01:36:19,296 --> 01:36:23,205
No, not everything, my friend.
Here are the $ 1000 that you owe.

518
01:36:23,991 --> 01:36:25,984
The rest comes with us.

519
01:36:26,592 --> 01:36:28,965
With us, no.
Me.

520
01:36:32,344 --> 01:36:33,344
Dutch ...

521
01:36:34,014 --> 01:36:35,014
You said ...

522
01:36:35,673 --> 01:36:36,673
We agreed.

523
01:36:37,592 --> 01:36:39,759
We gold repartiríamos
between you and me.

524
01:36:40,341 --> 01:36:42,319
What you played well,
I never said that.

525
01:36:42,885 --> 01:36:45,452
I listened to me,
but your ambition, like everyone else.

526
01:36:46,297 --> 01:36:48,135
I promised $ 1000 and there they are.

527
01:36:49,302 --> 01:36:50,551
Yours too, Louis.

528
01:36:59,367 --> 01:37:02,617
Dutch,
has been a masterstroke.

529
01:37:04,591 --> 01:37:06,496
You made us risk our skins.

530
01:37:06,859 --> 01:37:09,893
You made him believe the boy
who would you go halfway,

531
01:37:10,494 --> 01:37:13,545
and had perfectly planned
the stay with it.

532
01:37:16,402 --> 01:37:17,933
Not for me, Captain.

533
01:37:18,751 --> 01:37:21,769
I told you it was for the revolutionary
and to them will go.

534
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,693
A few years ago I was a hunted man
in the United States.

535
01:37:25,764 --> 01:37:30,117
So I came to Mexico.
I found good people who shook my hand.

536
01:37:30,953 --> 01:37:32,108
And I met a girl.

537
01:37:32,778 --> 01:37:34,633
For a time all went well.

538
01:37:37,013 --> 01:37:39,834
Then one day,
soldiers came,

539
01:37:40,763 --> 01:37:44,006
saying that his father and brothers
were revolutionists,

540
01:37:44,689 --> 01:37:45,990
and that she was his accomplice.

541
01:37:46,591 --> 01:37:50,775
I knew nothing about the Revolution and did not know
the problems of farmers, so ...

542
01:37:52,073 --> 01:37:53,290
I was released.

543
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:58,596
But they shot the other,
even the girl.

544
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:01,748
It was my wife.

545
01:38:02,634 --> 01:38:04,777
No Captain, gold is not for me.

546
01:38:05,866 --> 01:38:08,608
It is for Manuel Esteban, for farmers,
for the Revolution.

547
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,237
I did this for my wife.

548
01:38:13,927 --> 01:38:15,554
Now you listen to me.

549
01:38:16,586 --> 01:38:20,035
You can hide, go to another country,
rename.

550
01:38:20,987 --> 01:38:22,641
But wherever you are

551
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,120
I'll find you.

552
01:38:26,262 --> 01:38:28,003
No matter how long it takes.

553
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,314
But I will find you.

554
01:38:31,984 --> 01:38:33,224
I know you will, Captain.

555
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:38,391
I will leave the horses for a day
from here.

556
01:39:03,501 --> 01:39:04,501
Soldiers!

557
01:39:26,105 --> 01:39:27,127
You two, come with me.

558
01:41:34,045 --> 01:41:35,216
Are you with him?

559
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:38,165
No, I am with mine.

560
01:42:07,511 --> 01:42:08,511
Dutch!

561
01:42:16,148 --> 01:42:17,946
Did you succeed?

562
01:42:19,318 --> 01:42:20,318
Ehh ..!

563
01:42:25,883 --> 01:42:27,577
Yes, we succeeded!

564
01:42:27,878 --> 01:42:29,098
Viva!

565
01:43:42,563 --> 01:43:43,563
Thank you!

566
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:52,250
