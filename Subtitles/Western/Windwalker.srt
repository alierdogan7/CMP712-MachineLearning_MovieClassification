00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:54,125
In the winter of 1797, illness forced a band of
Cheyenne to migrate south, leaving behind those
who were too weak or sick to travel.

2
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:16,043
I will search for elk, my father

3
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,450
Why are there tears?

4
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:25,145
Gratitude for a son

5
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:41,700
Take care of your grandfather,
my children. He is sich

6
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,400
He needs comfort

7
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:00,500
Don't worry

8
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:04,501
My eyes are dim, but I still see

9
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,200
I am a burden...

10
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,500
to my family

11
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,101
Grandfather...

12
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,500
we will take care of you.
Are you  afraid to die?

13
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:22,633
No, it is time for this old body to
nourish the earth

14
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,910
But I was not always old

15
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,117
You were once a boy?

16
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,495
Old men do not grow from young girls

17
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,515
He was a great warrior

18
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:43,470
I need a wife to give me children

19
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:45,230
They are swift and strong

20
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,954
You have one wife already

21
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,259
I have counted many coups

22
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,927
Ah-foolish boy

23
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:11,450
Get Away!

24
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,500
Get Away!

25
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:16,050
Get Away!

26
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,286
I said - Get Away!

27
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,240
I will come back later

28
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:52,766
Eight skins

29
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,060
More than she is worth

30
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,350
Old friend, these horses are for you

31
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,950
I would share my life with your daughter

32
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,740
forever…

33
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,983
You have shamed this warrior

34
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,950
I am no longer welcome
among the Cheyenne

35
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,663
I am leaving

36
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:50,000
Keep your woman...

37
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,540
We are enemies until one of us dies

38
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:49,030
Our father is one of these sons?

39
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,820
Ehere is our father's brother?

40
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,850
Did you hear me? Get the wood

41
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,650
Get some help!

42
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,880
Cheyenne! Cheyenne!

43
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,025
Cheyenne!

44
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,800
Cheyenne!

45
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,200
Do not be afraid, little one

46
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,150
Do not be afraid

47
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:41,120
I am your father

48
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:50,650
You are my son

49
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,840
I am your father

50
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,300
You are Cheyenne

51
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,790
You are Cheyenne

52
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,200
You are Cheyenne

53
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,460
Come quick!

54
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:33,580
Good journey, my father

55
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,700
The great white horse of the Cheyenne

56
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,380
A great warrior rides this horse

57
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,815
Nice little woman, that one

58
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,930
I will take her into my lodge with me

59
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,220
She will kill you-fool

60
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,850
More pleasant to die under a Cheyenne
woman's blanket

61
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,450
Than under the hooves of a war horse

62
00:50:55,410 --> 00:51:01,900
We must have a horse

63
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,001
This warrior and his horse,
they are like one

64
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,800
The one will take us to the other

65
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,610
He cannot be caught

66
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:47,200
let us circle until the sun sleeps...
then come again to this place

67
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,740
I'm hungry

68
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,000
We are all hungry!

69
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,840
She cannot help her pain

70
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,700
Oh Great One...

71
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:30,850
I have not heard with my ears

72
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:36,410
But now I understand with my heart

73
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:44,130
He came back

74
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,850
Do not fear. This old man is no spirit

75
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,335
I was called back!

76
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,680
He grows weaker. He must eat

77
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,810
I have brought food 

78
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:32,340
The Crows fell upon us. They are
still in the hills...

79
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:37,000
The Great One has sent you back to us!

80
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,280
Enought of this

81
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,250
He has counted coup and shamed us

82
01:06:21,351 --> 01:06:24,300
He is grat warrior

83
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,000
we kill him but he disappears

84
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,700
And his great horse

85
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,950
maybe the medicine of his ghost horse
is too strong for us

86
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,770
I fear no enemy's medicine

87
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,200
I will find him

88
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,750
On my belt I will hang his scalp

89
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,900
It will not be long now

90
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,950
I will havethis... "ghost horse"

91
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,350
We have take two horses...

92
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,000
That is honorable

93
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,150
I will have the white stallion…

94
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,900
And the heart of this enemy

95
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,800
And I will have his little woman

96
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,700
This Cheyenne is no common warrior

97
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,780
He will kill you all

98
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,050
Youu speak like a woman!

99
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,350
Pride blinds you eye

100
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:26,000
This Cheyenne bleeds like every man

101
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:29,550
and he will die like every man

102
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,330
You have no courage

103
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:34,035
Does it take courage...

104
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,000
...to fight womenand children for
this horse?

105
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,900
We shall find and take all their horses

106
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,850
And my woman - by sunset

107
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,700
This is honorable. Then we will go

108
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:39,750
Grandfather, where did you get this 
big bear skin?

109
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,150
From a big bear

110
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,500
That's here

111
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,750
How did you come to be alive?

112
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,200
Was it not good to die?

113
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:51,150
Ah, so many questions. But that is good

114
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,700
It's a very long story

115
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,250
I have many questions mysealf

116
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,000
I have yet to fully understand

117
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,300
why this old man was brought back

118
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,850
from the land of the

119
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:10,200
sky people

120
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,201
Grandfather?

121
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,250
Will the Crows come again?

122
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:27,800
Yes, they will come again

123
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,440
It is shameful

124
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,600
to follow this wounded warrior and
his women

125
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:07,550
If you fear his strange medicine…

126
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,200
then do not ride with us

127
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,850
Go on...

128
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,500
You are all fools!

129
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:18,100
I do not want to be part of it

130
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,900
Then leave us!

131
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:09,200
It is too soon for you to be warriors

132
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,700
You hearts are brave, but they are small

133
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:16,710
Today our hearts are full of one another

134
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,830
We must fight...

135
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:25,800
We must fight!

136
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:11,650
May all that pass come in peace

137
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,800
He must die for Smiling Wolf!

138
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,300
No - bind him

139
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,150
he shall not die

140
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
They are close

141
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,400
They warn us! Who is afraid?

142
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,350
Oh Great One

143
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,300
give us strenght

144
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:14,500
Do not fear death

145
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:18,000
As spring begins with winter

146
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,000
so death begins with birth

147
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,400
It is only a step

148
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:30,900
in the great circle of life

149
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,800
Fight without fear

150
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,100
You are Cheyenne!

151
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,700
You are Cheyenne!

152
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,850
I am not Crow

153
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:18,900
I am Cheyenne!

154
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:26,150
I am Cheyenne!

155
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,600
I am Cheyenne!

156
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:39,250
The lost one!

157
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,600
I have found my son

158
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,900
For this you have kept me so long

159
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:55,850
now I understand...
my son is returned to me!

160
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:17,750
This enemy insults me!

161
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,900
an old man comes to fight his battles

162
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,150
This is a joke!
Where is the great warrior?

163
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:31,650
No, evil eye, many seasons ago you
stole my son

164
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,450
Have not these years caused enough
heartache?

165
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,950
now let there be peace between us

166
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,700
Now I know the truth

167
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,820
I am not Crow

168
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:40,200
Let us part in life, not in death

169
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,950
My medicine is strong. This is my emblem

170
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:12,350
You raised me

171
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:14,900
but I am no longer your son

172
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:20,300
My heart is now with my true family

173
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,650
You should die...

174
01:38:30,850 --> 01:38:32,900
but I let you go

175
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,350
In peace
