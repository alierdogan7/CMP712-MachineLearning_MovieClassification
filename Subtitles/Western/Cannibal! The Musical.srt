1
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:55,089
The sky is blue and all the leaves are green.

2
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:59,235
The sun's as warm as a baked potato.

3
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:03,423
I think I know precisely what I mean,

4
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:07,160
When I say it's a shpadoinkle day.

5
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,867
And as I ride with my girl,

6
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:14,838
She's my best friend in the whole world!

7
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,943
We'll move along, set our goals high

8
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:24,782
With eyes full of hope as we aim for the...

9
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,005
Sky is blue and all the leaves are green.

10
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:32,161
My heart's as full as a baked potato.

11
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,238
I think I know precisely what I mean,

12
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:40,516
When I say it's a shpadoinkle day!

13
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:53,242
When I say it's a happy-go-moinkaly
lucky shpadoinklely...dayyyyyy.

14
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:56,781
It's a long, long way for us to go,

15
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,476
But if we don't try we'll never know.

16
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:04,561
Stay optimistic, set our goals high,

17
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:09,406
There's nothing we can't do if we aim for the...

18
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:12,719
Sky is blue and all the leaves are green.

19
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:16,938
The air's as pure as a baked potato.

20
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:20,234
We think we know exactly what we mean,

21
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:24,197
When we say it's a shpadoinkle day.

22
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:28,050
When we say it's a shpadoinkle day!

23
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,771
I know that there's more to life than women.

24
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,148
I just can't seem to figure out what else there is.

25
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,912
I don't need it every night,
every morning would be just fine.

26
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:29,562
A little sex, that's all I'm askin' for.

27
00:22:30,995 --> 00:22:34,240
That's all I'm askin' for!
That's all he's askin' for!

28
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:37,925
Something I can test,
a gal would suit me best.

29
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:41,631
I got a thing to use,
I know what to use it for.

30
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,934
A girl I can love, and kiss,
and hold, and fu...

31
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,423
That's all I'm askin' for!

32
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:50,487
Now I don't wanna be rich
for the sake of women.

33
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,884
I wanna be rich for the sake of our lord.

34
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:58,389
Enough to build a church
where everyone can come.

35
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,459
Enough for the lord,
that's all I'm askin' for.

36
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:04,088
That's all I'm askin' for!

37
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:05,595
That's all he's askin' for!

38
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,383
It ain't a lot to ask.
I'm sure we'll get it fast.

39
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:12,973
A friend of mine was mining
and he made a lot of cash.

40
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,892
He made a gazillion dollars, how is that!

41
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,823
That's all I'm askin' for!

42
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,007
He did not make a gazillion dollars!

43
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,389
You wanna ask him?!
I'll tell you where he lives!

44
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:24,670
That's all he's askin' for.

45
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,880
That's all I'm askin' for.

46
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:29,819
We're tired of being sick.
We're sick of being poor.

47
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,504
We've had a little luck,
Now we want a little more.

48
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:36,502
Enough so we'd never do anything anymore.

49
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:38,236
That's all we're askin' for!

50
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:41,970
Hey, what about you Mr. Miller,
what are you askin' for?

51
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:45,471
No, no, I don't sing.

52
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:48,066
Aw come on, if you can talk, you can sing.

53
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:52,196
I just wanna make enough so
I can open up a shop of my own

54
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,359
and go on with my family trade.

55
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,915
Well there, that's great. What is it you do?

56
00:23:57,899 --> 00:23:58,546
I'm a butcher.

57
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:01,071
You're a butcher?!

58
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:02,877
Yeah.

59
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:14,033
I've never had much in the
way of friends or fam'ly.

60
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:19,002
My horse is the only pal
I've ever known.

61
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:24,669
I'd like to build a ranch
in the Rocky Mountain air.

62
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,491
A home for us,
that's all I'm askin' for!

63
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,128
That's all we're askin' for!

64
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:31,586
That's all we're askin' for!

65
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:35,281
We're tired of being sick.
We're sick of being poor.

66
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:38,976
We've had a little luck,
now we want a little more.

67
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:41,936
A girl I can love! A church!
A ranch! A store.

68
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:45,153
That's all we're askin',
that's all we're askin',

69
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,791
that's all we're askin' for!

70
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:52,217
Ahahahaa!!...Shpadoinkle!!..hahahaa!!

71
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:38,242
She'll never know
what she meant to me.

72
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:42,686
Whenever I was with her

73
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:49,029
I was always as gentle
as I could be.

74
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:57,412
And now I don't know why,
but she's gone away.

75
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:04,401
And I'll just have to stand
on my own two legs.

76
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:13,123
Your eyes, your smile
Made my little life worthwhile.

77
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:17,721
There's was nothing I couldn't do

78
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:26,937
When I was on top of you.

79
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:29,557
I'd pull her hair,

80
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,281
and she'd know to stop.

81
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:37,449
And when she'd look behind her,

82
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:42,149
I'd always be there.

83
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,347
And now I don't know why, but she,
she's gone.

84
00:33:46,713 --> 00:33:49,833
And all I can do is try

85
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:54,728
to carry on.

86
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,540
Your eyes, your smile

87
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:02,919
Made my little life worthwhile.

88
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:08,923
The sky was a lot more blue,

89
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:16,516
When I was on top of you.

90
00:34:28,522 --> 00:34:35,028
When I was on top of you.

91
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:56,941
I can catch a helpless animal,

92
00:43:58,058 --> 00:44:01,240
skin it with my bare hands.

93
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:05,120
I wake up muddy, and I go to bed bloody,

94
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:08,795
'cause I'm a trappin' man.

95
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:13,696
I can brave the nastiest weather.
Weather!

96
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:15,500
Even if it's 80 below.
Below!

97
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:19,177
My pa was an elephant, but that's irrelevant.
My ma was an Eskimo.

98
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:21,497
I eat rabbits' heads for breakfast.
Breakfast!

99
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:23,455
With beaver butt on the side.
The side!

100
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:27,235
My mind's magnificent and my body no different.
I'm full of trapper pride!

101
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:29,973
Yo-ho!
Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

102
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,268
Rip their fur, cut their skin with my knife.

103
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:36,120
Yo-ho!
Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

104
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:41,399
One thing's for sure,
there's nothing like a trappin' life!

105
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,618
I'm badder than the baddest sailor!
Sailor!

106
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:45,229
I make love to women to 10 feet tall.
Good lord!

107
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:49,233
I've got a chest of wonder and balls of thunder.
I can break right through a wall.

108
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:51,515
I love the sound of metal,
Metal!

109
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:53,631
Snapping on an animal's head.
Ka-chink!

110
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:57,357
Sometimes they scamper, sometimes they whimper,
but they always end up dead.

111
00:44:57,851 --> 00:45:01,589
I've always wanted to be somebody

112
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:04,432
who didn't get pushed around.

113
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:08,579
Now that I'm a trapper,

114
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:13,351
I'm the meanest guy around.
Second meanest!

115
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:17,344
The blood of a fresh-cut rodent
is as sweet as brandy wine.

116
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,702
And the brain of an antelope
tastes like cantaloupe.

117
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,492
What a yummy life!

118
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,548
Yo-ho!
Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

119
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:27,781
Rip their fur, cut their eyes out with my knife.

120
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,309
Yo-ho!
Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

121
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,080
Oh, stop!

122
00:45:32,459 --> 00:45:33,445
That's sick!

123
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:36,524
I agree!
Nutter was singing in the wrong key!

124
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:38,978
No I wasn't!
It was Loutzenheiser!

125
00:45:39,162 --> 00:45:40,469
I was singing in E flat minor.

126
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:42,265
The SONG'S in F sharp major!

127
00:45:42,756 --> 00:45:46,945
I think they're the same thing.
I mean, E flat is the relative minor of F sharp.

128
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:51,462
No it isn't! The relative minor is
three half-tones DOWN from the major, not up!

129
00:45:52,672 --> 00:45:55,949
No, it's three down.
Like A is the relative minor of C major.

130
00:45:56,347 --> 00:45:58,330
But isn't A sharp in C major?

131
00:45:58,668 --> 00:46:01,566
Wait, are you singing mixolydian scales or something?

132
00:46:01,944 --> 00:46:05,425
A sharp is tonic to C major! It's the sixth!

133
00:46:05,733 --> 00:46:06,400
No it isn't!

134
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:08,978
Well, it would be like a raised 13th if anything.

135
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:43,935
What is this magic I feel?

136
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:52,064
Seems no matter where I am,
it finds me.

137
00:49:52,730 --> 00:50:00,094
Puts the memories of hope inside me.

138
00:50:00,852 --> 00:50:08,470
Makes me warm once more.

139
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:14,968
He's just a quiet man,

140
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:22,923
But his eyes can see right through me.

141
00:50:23,364 --> 00:50:31,124
Is it only that I feel pity?

142
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:39,534
Could it be something more?

143
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:46,226
Safe as an island,
Far off to sea.

144
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:57,026
I'd almost forgotten
This side of me.

145
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:10,737
What is this magic I feel?

146
00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:18,499
Thought this mushy stuff was below me.

147
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:26,649
Could it be he is the one to show me

148
00:51:27,325 --> 00:51:35,159
What compassion is for?

149
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:42,252
Safe as an island,
Far off to sea.

150
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:49,634
I'd almost forgotten
This side of me.

151
00:51:50,198 --> 00:51:56,473
Perhaps I'm not the cold bitch
I pretended to be.

152
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:12,284
I'd almost forgotten this side of me.

153
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:58,290
Let's build a snowman!
We can make him our best friend.

154
01:00:58,628 --> 01:01:01,781
We can name him Tom or
we can name him George!

155
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:05,309
We can make him tall,
or we can make him not so tall.

156
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:06,224
Snowman!

157
01:01:08,593 --> 01:01:11,766
He'll have a happy face, a happy smile,
a happy point of view.

158
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,844
If you build me a snowman,
then I'll build one for you.

159
01:01:15,028 --> 01:01:18,119
So, let's build a snowman!
We can make him our best friend.

160
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:21,794
We can name him Bob or
we can name him Beowulf!

161
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,172
We can make him tall,
or we can make him not so tall.

162
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:25,989
Snowman!

163
01:01:44,903 --> 01:01:47,420
He'll have a happy face, a happy smile,
a happy point of view.

164
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:50,674
If you build me a snowman,
then I'll build one for you.

165
01:01:51,072 --> 01:01:57,509
Snowman!
Snowman! Snowman!

166
01:27:11,488 --> 01:27:14,539
Hang the bastard, hang him high.

167
01:27:15,009 --> 01:27:17,784
Hoist his body to the sky.

168
01:27:18,193 --> 01:27:21,191
It's as nice as a day can be.

169
01:27:21,734 --> 01:27:24,702
Won't you come to the hanging with me?

170
01:27:36,898 --> 01:27:41,331
Hang the bastard, hang him high.
Hoist his body to the sky.

171
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:44,248
It's as nice as a day can be.

172
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:47,832
Won't you come to the hanging with me?

173
01:27:48,405 --> 01:27:52,768
Hang the bastard, hang him well.
Send his sorry soul to hell.

174
01:27:53,218 --> 01:27:55,326
When his neckbone snaps we'll know.

175
01:27:55,786 --> 01:27:58,436
When the cannibal won't be killing anymore.

176
01:27:58,711 --> 01:28:00,982
His face will turn red,
Then purple, then blue.

177
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:03,651
We'll watch from up here
To get a good view.

178
01:28:04,102 --> 01:28:06,524
And when his eyes bug out we'll know,

179
01:28:06,873 --> 01:28:11,771
It's the end of him
And the end of the show!

180
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:17,631
So hang the bastard, hang him with cheer.
We'll make some hot dogs
And drink a few beers.

181
01:28:17,989 --> 01:28:20,147
And when his tongue rolls out we'll know,

182
01:28:20,741 --> 01:28:25,413
It's the end of the show
And we all can go home!

183
01:28:25,589 --> 01:28:28,824
But not till we hang the bastard, hang him here.

184
01:28:29,224 --> 01:28:31,708
The most exciting thing this town has seen in years.

185
01:28:32,128 --> 01:28:34,337
When his body stops jerking we'll know,

186
01:28:34,758 --> 01:28:38,578
It's the end of him, it's the end of him,
It's the end of him,

187
01:28:39,018 --> 01:28:42,550
And the end of the show.

188
01:28:44,184 --> 01:28:45,068
[Cowbell solo]

189
01:28:57,016 --> 01:29:03,197
So hang the bastard, hang him high.
Kiss his guilty butt goodbye.

190
01:29:03,669 --> 01:29:05,714
It's as nice as a day can be.

191
01:29:06,882 --> 01:29:08,907
Won't you come to the hanging with me?

192
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,596
His veins will pop out all over his head.

193
01:29:11,944 --> 01:29:14,315
We'll tickle his armpits to make sure he's dead.

194
01:29:14,644 --> 01:29:16,925
And when his tongue rolls out we'll know,

195
01:29:17,384 --> 01:29:22,027
It's the end of him and we all can go home!

196
01:29:22,684 --> 01:29:28,763
But not till we
Hang the bastard, hang him high.

197
01:29:29,264 --> 01:29:32,879
Hoist his body to the sky.

198
01:29:33,328 --> 01:29:39,017
When his body stops jerking we'll know,

199
01:29:40,977 --> 01:29:44,735
It's the end of him, it's the end of him,
It's the end of him!

200
01:29:45,176 --> 01:29:53,647
Let's get on with the show!

201
01:29:55,438 --> 01:29:56,457
Hooray!

202
01:33:28,968 --> 01:33:32,747
The sky is blue and all the leaves are green.

203
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:36,927
My heart's as full as a baked potato.

204
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:40,778
I'm sure you know exactly what I mean,

205
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:44,719
When I say it's a shpadoinkle day.

206
01:33:46,116 --> 01:33:56,056
When we say it's a shpadoinkle day!

207
01:34:08,713 --> 01:34:18,989
