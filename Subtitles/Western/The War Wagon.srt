(Theme song begins)

2
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,950
Chorus: <i>"Look at those horses,
what are they draggin'?</i>

3
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,920
<i>"Heavily guarded,
what is that wagon?</i>

4
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,720
<i>"War Wagon, what is it for?
War Wagon, loaded with gold"</i>

5
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,990
<i>Most men are fightin' for a wagon full of gold</i>

6
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,590
<i>Scratchin' an' fightin' for a wagon full of gold</i>

7
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,090
<i>A piece of land, my cattle brand,
a place to rest my head</i>

8
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,090
<i>The feelin' of a woman's love are all you really need for livin'</i>

9
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,090
<i>Three years in prison made me
dream a lot of dreams</i>

10
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,090
<i>Sometimes a dream is not
as easy as it seems</i>

11
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,090
<i>But wrong or right I have to fight,
'cause when the truth is told</i>

12
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,390
<i>All men are fightin' for a wagon full of gold</i>

13
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,090
Chorus: <i>"Look at those horses,
what are they draggin'?</i>

14
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,590
<i>"Heavily guarded,
what is that wagon?"</i>

15
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,590
<i>Most men are fightin' for
a wagon full of gold</i>

16
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,190
<i>Scratchin' an' fightin' for
a wagon full of gold</i>

17
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,190
<i>A piece of land, my cattle brand,
a place to rest my head</i>

18
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,890

a-searchin' for, a-strivin' for...</i>

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,090
<i>a wagon full of gooooooold!!!</i>

25
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:00,593
Sheriff,
Taw Jackson's back in town.

26
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:02,390
Are you sure?

27
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,590
He's ridin' down the street right now,
big as life.

28
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:22,738
Goin' huntin'?

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,625
Don't do anything real fast now, Taw.

30
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:31,500
You fellas seem real jumpy.

31
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:33,750
- How'd you get out?
- Parole.

32
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,250
What. after only three years?

33
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:38,213
Good behavior.

34
00:04:38,637 --> 00:04:43,381
This paper says I have to report in to
the local law officer wherever I am.

35
00:04:43,974 --> 00:04:46,894
Check-in day is every Monday.
Figurin' on stickin' around, are you?

36
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:48,420
For a while.

37
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,420
- Your old spread belongs to Mr Pierce now.
- I heard that.

38
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:54,774
It's his legally, he doesn't want trespassers,
so you stay off it.

39
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,943
Oh, I'll sure do that.

40
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,820
Maybe prison
took some of the starch out of you.

41
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,448
Maybe.

42
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:57,499
- Where's Lomax?
- In Randado. The Oriental Palace.

43
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:01,871
- Billy Hyatt's in Chubisco.
- Levi?

44
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,128
He's down by Mesquite,
with Calita's gang.

45
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:11,510
- What about the shipment?
- The big one's four days from now.

46
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,793
Doesn't give us much time.

47
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:15,713
Nope.

48
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,464
Put back that salt.

49
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:19,890
The salt!

50
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:25,520
Pierce catches you stealin' now,
you won't be worth a damn to me.

51
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,560
- Mr Pierce.
- Did it get here yet?

52
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,260
No, not yet. But it will be here in time the trip after next.

53
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:17,402
That's when we want her.

54
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,610
Alright, let's clean her up.

55
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:22,734
- Check the rim on the left front wheel.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:25,822
Beauty!

57
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:48,390
Mr Pierce,
Taw Jackson's in town.

58
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,790
What?

59
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:51,250
He's out on parole.

60
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,550
- Where is he?
- I don't know, I haven't seen him since this morning.

61
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:57,100
You mean you let him go?
Don't you know he could take a shot at Mr Pierce.

62
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,100
Get Hammond and Brown.

63
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:01,520
You think he'll try somethin'?

64
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,520
Wouldn't you?

65
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,520
Mr. Pierce.

66
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,571
Get fresh horses.
I want you in Randado before sun-up.

67
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,361
Find Lomax.

68
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:18,283
I want him to kill Taw Jackson.
I'll pay him anything he wants.

69
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,323
You'll pay him anything, sir?

70
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,077
I'll go for 10,000.

71
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,081
Hell, Mr Pierce, we'd be willin' to do it for
a lot less than $10,000.

72
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:34,172
If you could. Lomax is the one man
that can, so get movin'.

73
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,304
Yes, sir.

74
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:43,520
Boss, you know the way they feel
about each other.

75
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,392
Lomax would probably ride all the way
over here to kill him for nothin'.

76
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:51,145
Unless there's money in it,
Lomax'll ain't gonna do nothin' for nothin'.

77
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,523
And I want Taw Jackson dead.

78
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:39,193
- What'll ya have?
- Whiskey.

79
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,480
I understand, ah...

80
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,480
Lomax is around.

81
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,489
So?

82
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:52,915
- I wanna see him.
- Yeah, and who are you?

83
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:55,079
Taw Jackson.

84
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:58,953
Enjoy you're drink.
It'll be your last.

85
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,997
Well, that'd be a shame.

86
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:07,960
Kinda hoped
that my last drink'd be a big one.

87
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:11,256
Bottle's in front of you. Pour all you want.

88
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:15,980
- Gonna shoot me in the back?
- You deserve it.

89
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:19,347
- You caused me a lot of embarrassment.
- How?

90
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:23,233
You're the only man I ever shot,
and didn't kill.

91
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,654
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

92
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:31,690
that slug you put in me
kept me in hospital for six months.

93
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,690
(Gunshot)

94
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,690
Lomax.

95
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:56,970
What made you think
I wouldn't kill you?

96
00:10:58,393 --> 00:10:59,540
Curiosity.

97
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:04,475
Well, you're still alive.
Now what's to keep you that way?

98
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,023
- Money.
- How much?

99
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:14,061
Your share'll be over 100,000.

100
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:17,030
That's what I've always said
the world needs:

101
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,534
More simple understanding to bring
people together. Lhotse! Khaloo!

102
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:28,033
- Yeah, we can talk upstairs.
- What I have to say is private.

103
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:34,207
Can't get more private. Neither one
of them speaks a word of English. C'mon.

104
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:55,021
Come on in!

105
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:59,000
God, I hope this meeting will be friendlier
than the one 3 years ago.

106
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,390
Taw: Couldn't be much unfriendlier.

107
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,571
Do you know why Pierce
wants you to kill me?

108
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:09,023
So he could legally steal your land,
once he found there was gold on it.

109
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,528
You were a hard working ranch hand
just defending your property.

110
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,574
But you got shot, framed,
and sent to jail.

111
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:17,545
I always thought that was kind of amusing.

112
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:20,876
Nice to find a fella
with a keen sense of humor.

113
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,584
Old Pierce
found a lotta gold on your land.

114
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:28,959
That ore assays out
at $643 a tonne, normally.

115
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:33,020
But they've hit the mother lode,
which'll be 1,200 per cent richer.

116
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
Until the lode runs out.

117
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:38,725
For a man out a short while you know
a lot about Mr. Peirce's business.

118
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:43,771
- He's important to me.
- You thinkin' about his gold?

119
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:45,904
- My gold.
- Forget it.

120
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:49,485
In town or at the mine, you can't get
within a mile of it. Have some grub.

121
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:52,529
No thanks.
How about outta town?

122
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,400
I guess you don't know about his new toy.

123
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,700
A little iron-plated thing
he calls the "War Wagon".

124
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:03,368
Takes an average of 50,000 in gold
from Emmett to the rail head in El Paso.

125
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:06,084
- Forty-three and half miles away.
- There are a few guards.

126
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:10,916
Thirty-three of them. Twenty-eight
outriders, and five in the coach.

127
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:17,346
Each man is armed with a Henry repeating rifle,
two Colts and 200 rounds ammunition.

128
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,004
- What's all of this got to do with me?
- We're going to take that wagon.

129
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:24,134
We are?

130
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,315
You taken a look lately
at the cemetery at Emmett?

131
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:32,060
There's a big bunch of cheap wooden crosses,
in one corner, all crowded in together.

132
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:36,233
That's a tribute to the last fools
who tried to stop the War Wagon.

133
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,565
You like facts? $1.15 for the casket,
and 12 cents for the crosses.

134
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,700
Pierce foots the bill.

135
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:49,993
$1.27 seems a poor price to pay
for a man's life, especially mine.

136
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:52,850
In four days, Pierce is going to make
the biggest gold shipment...

137
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,000
ever made out of the territory.

138
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,626
A half a million dollars.

139
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:02,294
A half a million? How we gonna
take it, with the Prussian army?

140
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:04,793
With three other fellows.
Five of us.

141
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:09,637
Five? I'm kinda glad I didn't
kill you tonight. You're funny as hell.

142
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,848
- Wanna hear how?
- How we end up in jail or on the run?

143
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:15,062
- Not if we do it my way.
- No chance.

144
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:20,310
$100,000, Lomax, that's your share.
You're ready to listen?

145
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,480
- Why me?
- You're good with guns.

146
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,780
Besides, you're the only safe cracker I know.

147
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,579
- How'd you ever find that out?
- An old friend of yours in prison.

148
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,664
For the last time,
are you gonna listen?

149
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,659
Alright.
Let's hear it.

150
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,129
Stony Flats.
The War Wagon.

151
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,120
(Rooster crows)

152
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
(Knock on door)

153
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,064
Yeah!

154
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,521
- One condition.
- What's that?

155
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:16,411
My time till the robbery costs $100
a day, and if I fire my gun $500.

156
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,111
Haven't got that kind of money.

157
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,573
I'll take a marker against
your share of the gold.

158
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,580
Deal.

159
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,629
You always wear a gun
over your underwear?

160
00:15:32,176 --> 00:15:33,339
Just lately.

161
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,330
(Church bell ringing)

162
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,540
- Morning, Mr Lomax.
- Hello, Smitty.

163
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,540
You want I should saddle your horse for ya?

164
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,610
Please.

165
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:16,374
Your in the third stall on the left.

166
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,370
(Dog barking)

167
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,149
There he is.

168
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,193
- Lomax!
- Morning, Lomax.

169
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:55,490
What do ya want?

170
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:59,748
- Mr Pierce would like to talk to you.
- What for?

171
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,375
It's about Taw Jackson.

172
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,673
What about Taw Jackson?

173
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:10,925
Well, Mr Pierce said he'll go
all the way up to 10,000 dollars.

174
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,178
- Hey, Taw, you hear that?
Taw: I heard.

175
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:22,597
You're worth a lot of money.
Dead.

176
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:28,990
Taw, this wasn't our idea at all. We're just
deliverin' a message for Mr. Pierce, that's all.

177
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,026
Yeah.

178
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:34,361
What's your answer?

179
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:37,073
Tell him that I'm interested in his offer,
and I'll be thinking about it.

180
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,662
Yes, sir, we sure will.
Come on.

181
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:49,376
- The boss ain't gonna like that answer.
- I know it.

182
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,560
Why don't we do it?

183
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:57,086
That would make Mr Pierce
very grateful to us.

184
00:17:57,514 --> 00:17:58,889
Ain't no better time!

185
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,880
Now!

186
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,471
Mine hit the ground first.

187
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,933
Mine was taller.

188
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:23,278
Yes, sir,
a good way to start our partnership.

189
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,658
- How's that?
- A $500 day.

190
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:31,032
- I didn't ask for your help back there.
- Well, I can't afford to let you get killed...

191
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,498
unless I do it.

192
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:40,085
- Hey, why are we headed south?
- To pick up Levi Walking Bear.

193
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:42,918
- Levi who?
- Walking Bear.

194
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:46,381
He's running with Calita's gang,
down on the border.

195
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:50,176
- Pretty rough outfit.
- Yeah. Well, we need him.

196
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:53,555
He's worth 100,000 dollars to ya.

197
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,605
Ninety.

198
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:14,620
Taw: Buenos días.
- Buenos días.

199
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,955
(In Spanish):
Whose pigs are these?

200
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,542
Yours?

201
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:21,585
Fine.

202
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,290
Information?

203
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:44,142
- Buenos días, Señorita.
- Welcome, Señor. Tequila?

204
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:45,649
Sure.

205
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:00,246
Thank you.
Salud!

206
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:08,126
- You're a pretty little girl.
- Little girl?

207
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,668
Well, you're not a little boy.

208
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,375
Where's Calita's camp?

209
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:19,505
Don't know.

210
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:21,256
Are you sure?

211
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:28,847
Well, then.
How about a drink?

212
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,517
A little one.

213
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,275
That's good!

214
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:52,332
Gracias, Señor.

215
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:57,957
- Where did you get that?
- I sleep on this ring.

216
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,461
Yes, every night like this.

217
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:21,565
For the tequila.

218
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:29,326
- Do you not want anything else?
- Later.

219
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,584
- Let's go.
- Go where?

220
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:41,949
Calita's. Third canyon south,
two miles up.

221
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:45,377
You have to appeal to their intellect.

222
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:30,370
(Gunfire in the distance)

223
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,638
Let me guess which one's your friend.

224
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:57,903
Hey, don't shoot!

225
00:23:01,117 --> 00:23:03,403
- Well...
- Yeah.

226
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Yah!

227
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Yah!

228
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,852
Come on. Yah!

229
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,850
Those gallon jugs are only trash,
shoot them up!

230
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,850
Hey!

231
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:46,664
Hey, comrades! Ready?

232
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:03,472
- Who the hell are you?
- Shut up. Don't drop your arm.

233
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:04,970
What?

234
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,852
- Where ya goin'?
- Another target.

235
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,218
Get outta here!

236
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:31,086
My horses! Where are my horses?

237
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,447
Looks like we made it.

238
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,300
Thanks, Taw. You might say I owe
you fellas my life.

239
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,860
Yeah, yuh might.

240
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,417
Lomax,
Levi Walking Bear.

241
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,587
- So you're Lomax.
- What was that all about back there?

242
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:15,082
- We were playin' poker.
- So?

243
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,383
I was cheatin'.

244
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:22,214
- Hey, you got a bargain, big man.
- How's that?

245
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:25,255
Two $500 days for the price of one.

246
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,685
Thanks.

247
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,394
Hey! Why'd you stick your necks out for me?

248
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,733
We got a job for yuh.

249
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:37,904
Lomax, I want you to swing over to Chubisco.
- Chubisco?

250
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,156
Pick up a kid named Billy Hyatt
and bring him out to the old mission.

251
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,276
Sure hate being away from yuh.

252
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,995
I'm afraid that's how it's
gonna have to be.

253
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:51,999
Don't let anything happen to yuh.

254
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,498
Not likely.

255
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:03,798
A beautiful thing to see.
Friendship.

256
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,177
Yeah.

257
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:37,829
You seen a fella around here
named "Billy Hyatt"?

258
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,447
Yeah.

259
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,955
- Where?
- There.

260
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,550
Uh!

261
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,950
Billy Hyatt?

262
00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:04,010
What are ya doin'?

263
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,019
- You Billy Hyatt?
- Yeah.

264
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:09,517
Stand up.

265
00:29:10,572 --> 00:29:15,149
- I can't even sit up.
- Come on now, I said stand up!

266
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,284
I'm doin' ma best.

267
00:29:17,703 --> 00:29:19,230
- Got a horse?
- Huh?

268
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,230
- Have yuh got a horse?
- No.

269
00:29:21,665 --> 00:29:22,742
Come on.

270
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:26,166
I ain't goin' no place.
Let me alone.

271
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:45,290
Billy: Let me off, Mister.
- Not yet, sonny.

272
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,090
- My head's splittin'.

273
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:53,273
Yuh stink!
Tell me kid, what are you good for?

274
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,482
- Good for?
- You heard me.

275
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:02,978
- Nothin'. I'm good for nothin'.
- I believe it. Taw must be loco.

276
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:08,621
- Taw Jackson? Is he out?
- We're on our way to join him.

277
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:13,420
Doggone! Me and him spent two years
in prison together.

278
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,820
Heart-warming.

279
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:20,376
- That means Taw must be ready to...
- Yes?

280
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:24,758
A thing we talked about.

281
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:28,177
Listen, mister, this has gone
far enough. Let me down.

282
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:30,093
I will, sonny, I will.

283
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:37,809
What'd you do that for?

284
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:42,061
You share my horse,
I want you sober.

285
00:30:43,693 --> 00:30:44,771
And cleaner.

286
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:49,360
You can walk yourself dry.

287
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,369
Who's that?

288
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:37,110
- The War Wagon.
- So that's it.

289
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,110
Mister?

290
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,039
- You in with Taw?
- More or less.

291
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:55,082
Then I reckon I can tell you
what I'm good for. Explosives.

292
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:57,713
Explosives?

293
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,760
- Hammond and Brown get back?
- No, Sir.

294
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,870
What about Lomax?

295
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:40,579
Lomax? Not again.

296
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:44,546
Hello, Jackson.

297
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,340
It's Monday morning,
and I'm reporting in.

298
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,390
That's no concern of mine.

299
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,890
Why don't you tell the deputy here,
or the sheriff.

300
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:02,358
- Same thing, you own 'em.
- Alright, Taw, you're duly reported in.

301
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:06,630
- I understand you're stayin' on at my ranch.
- What used to be your ranch.

302
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,730
Why not? It's the nicest place around.

303
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:13,565
- I oughta know. I built it.
- And you did a real fine job.

304
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:18,910
- I'll be out there one day this week.
- Thinkin' of tryin' to get it back?

305
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:22,998
- Think about it all the time.
- You wouldn't stand a chance.

306
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,425
Tell you what I'll do for you, though.
I'll see that you get buried on that land.

307
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:33,050
Between then and now, I'm comin' out
to pick up my personal possessions.

308
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,550
Are they still there?

309
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,880
- How would I know?

310
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,341
- They all disappeared, somehow.
- Ain't nothin' there belongs to you.

311
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,350
This man's wearin' my gun.

312
00:33:46,776 --> 00:33:49,809
You're mixed up about that.
My Pa gave me this when I was a kid.

313
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:54,608
If you want it back, Taw,
why don't you just take it away from him.

314
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:00,113
It's mine.

315
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:07,208
- What's goin' on?
- Just collectin' somethin' that belongs to me.

316
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:10,494
- Who started it?
- Well sheriff, I guess you could say, I did.

317
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,910
The shells in here belong to him.

318
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,910
You tell him, he can come and get them,
anytime.

319
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,639
Throw some water on 'em.

320
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,630
(Horse neighs)

321
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:45,314
Taw!

322
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,859
I heard.

323
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:11,710
- Hey, Taw!
- Hello, Billy.

324
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,670
How ya keepin'?

325
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:15,250
- You look worse than you did
when you were in jail.

326
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,590
Ah, nothin' a drink wouldn't fix.

327
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,000
- Got anything?
- He's a drunk.

328
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,470
He drinks.

329
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:24,017
Way he's been shakin', I wouldn't
trust him with a firecracker.

330
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:28,275
- Is that true, Billy?
- I reckon, some folks look at it that way.

331
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:31,813
But I'm alright, Taw. I can handle my end.

332
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:35,780
- There's a lot at stake here, Billy.
- I can handle it.

333
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:39,904
- Good enough.
- I don't trust drunks.

334
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,917
Neither do I. But Billy stays here.

335
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:48,629
And there's nothing around this place stronger
than that cowboy coffee you're drinkin'.

336
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:53,548
You're sure he knows explosives, huh?

337
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,509
He handles them like you do a gun.

338
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:01,092
Hope you know what you're doin'.

339
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,090
In the distance: "Hayah!
Hayah!

340
00:36:04,023 --> 00:36:06,099
That'll be Wes.

341
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:12,650
Come on, come on.

342
00:36:16,952 --> 00:36:18,000
- Sit down!
- Wes.

343
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,510
- What's she doing here?
- She goes every place I go.

344
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:23,862
Lomax, this is Fletcher.
He's going to haul the gold away.

345
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:26,000
- Why him?
- I work for Pierce.

346
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,245
Ain't nobody figurin' on finding half a million
in gold Pierce's own flour barrel.

347
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:33,715
Half a million?
When do we split it up?

348
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:38,205
Wouldn't be too smart to flash gold
around right after the robbery.

349
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,835
Lomax: Maybe we should wait about six months.
- Six months?

350
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:43,968
Let's don't spend it before we get it.

351
00:36:44,557 --> 00:36:49,000
Keep your eyes off my wife!
- Your wife? I thought she was your daughter.

352
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:49,840
Well, she ain't!

353
00:36:50,271 --> 00:36:51,811
- Billy!
- You keep away from her!

354
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,310
- A drunk kid and a crazy old man!
How the hell...

355
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,810
Cut it out, all of ya!

356
00:36:56,237 --> 00:37:01,024
I didn't bring you here to be the best
of friends. We've got a lot of things  to do,

357
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:05,490
and only three days to do it in.
Come on over here.

358
00:37:12,537 --> 00:37:17,285
This map shows the run
from Emmett to El Paso.

359
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,411
First thing in the morning, Billy, I want you
to ride it, and check these two places.

360
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:24,957
Find out how much dynamite
you're gonna need.

361
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:29,546
The wagon takes five and a half
minutes to cross Stony Flats.

362
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:32,214
That's where we'll hit it first.

363
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:41,050
- Well, see ya later, partner.
- Where you goin'?

364
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,350
To town.

365
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,477
- I've got another business associate there, remember?
- I remember.

366
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:49,064
We wouldn't want him to be impatient,
would we?

367
00:37:49,574 --> 00:37:51,898
And hire somebody else.

368
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:54,900
Take good care of him.

369
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,073
Levi...

370
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:18,430
Let us pass!

371
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,593
Alright.

372
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:57,080
We walk from here.

373
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:03,792
Dumb Indians!

374
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,760
- Looks like they're getting ready to move out.
- They are.

375
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:09,472
Squaws, old men, children.

376
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,351
Pierce has starved them out.
He'll have all the land, now.

377
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:15,015
- What about Wild Horse?
- Him and the warriors are staying.

378
00:39:15,443 --> 00:39:18,358
Pierce'll hunt him down too.
Dumb Indians!

379
00:39:18,776 --> 00:39:19,720
And you're smart?

380
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,320
Sure! Cause I've learned to live in the
white man's world. Do what they do.

381
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:26,190
Grab all you can, anytime you can.

382
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:32,528
Wait here.

383
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,120
(Horse neighs)

384
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,717
- Your enemy is my enemy.
- Taw!

385
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:02,731
- Chief Wild Horse, Natani Jackson.
- Too many warriors have died.

386
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,480
- He says, "Your enemy is his enemy."
- Good.

387
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:11,030
No. He says he will lose
too many braves.

388
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:19,822
Ask him does he ride
with warriors or women.

389
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:27,039
If you want my tribe
and my warriors, I will do it.

390
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:31,350
He will do it, but he wants more
of everything.

391
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,750
He does or you do?

392
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:36,593
- Bargain with him.
- What exactly do you want?

393
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:40,881
He wants 600 bullets.

394
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:46,770
20 rifles.
A dozen blankets.

395
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:49,564
And 30 pounds of salt.

396
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:56,066
Tell him he drives a hard bargain.
But we'll agree.

397
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:04,282
You can stay.
But the white man must go.

398
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:10,872
It is done. And he wants me to stay
for dinner, but you're not welcome.

399
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:13,340
Having a white man in his camp offends him.

400
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,840
- You can tell him...
- What?

401
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:23,046
Nothing.

402
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:31,564
- Three sixes.
Player: Beats me.

403
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:33,652
Hello, Lola.

404
00:42:34,825 --> 00:42:36,987
It's been a long time, Lomax.

405
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,290
- May I join you?
- Sure.

406
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,990
It looks like you're still a winner.

407
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:48,254
I lose every once in a while.
How's your laundry service?

408
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:53,917
- Oh, they can't even speak English.
- A pity.

409
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:58,388
Any limit?

410
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:02,055
If there was, you wouldn't play.

411
00:43:19,866 --> 00:43:22,572
- Fifty.
Player 1: I'm out.

412
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,110
- Lola!
- Hello, Mr Pierce.

413
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,730
Player 2: Too rich for me.

414
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:32,210
- Two cards.
- You get my message?

415
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,410
Yeah.

416
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,372
- Took you long enough to get here.
- I had things to do.

417
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,582
Those two men I sent for you,
what happened to them?

418
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,388
I last saw them in the main street
in Randado. Three ladies.

419
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:49,632
You win, precious.

420
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:55,641
- Let's go someplace private.
- I like it here.

421
00:44:15,459 --> 00:44:18,458
Hey, bartender, how much you get
for whiskey around here?

422
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:19,952
Two bits.

423
00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:26,006
That's two cents.

424
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,802
- You gonna give me an answer or not?
- I'm thinkin' about it.

425
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:36,224
- How much is that?
- 27 cents.

426
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:38,850
Set it right there.

427
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:42,892
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

428
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:46,060
I'll go twelve thousand.

429
00:44:48,823 --> 00:44:50,397
Twelve?

430
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,613
I changed my mind about the tip.
Give me another two cents' worth!

431
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,907
Go out and walk it off.

432
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,217
Listen, I figure on bein'
an important person some day.

433
00:45:11,634 --> 00:45:13,707
You wanna think about treatin' me right.

434
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:15,378
Oh, I will, I will.

435
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:20,550
- What do yuh say?
- I'm still thinking about it.

436
00:45:20,974 --> 00:45:24,887
- Come on, bartender.
- Not for two cents. No.

437
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,515
But I done told you,
me and my friends, we're gonna be rich!

438
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:31,311
Sure. Well, come back then.

439
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:33,849
Hello there, cowboy.

440
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:37,814
You havin' trouble gettin' a drink?

441
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,734
I'm gonna buy this... hey!

442
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,147
What's goin' on down there?

443
00:45:45,914 --> 00:45:50,074
Sheriff, this drunk just insulted the lady.
Lock him up till he sleeps it off.

444
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,537
- What'd he do?
- You didn't notice?

445
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,668
- No.
- You been workin' saloons too long.

446
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:03,630
- What'd you do that for?
- I hate bad manners.

447
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,630
My deal?

448
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,320
Look, I'm gettin' tired of this run-around.

449
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,720
Just give me a yes or no
on the twelve thousand?

450
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:16,931
Yes.

451
00:46:17,735 --> 00:46:21,269
And I want it done quick.
- Don't push me. I'll do it when I'm ready!

452
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,535
What's your pleasure?

453
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,029
Stud.

454
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:49,919
What room is Señor Lomax in?

455
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:51,882
Five, Señor.

456
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:53,959
Five?

457
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,713
- Who's there?
Taw: It's me.

458
00:47:37,805 --> 00:47:41,139
We may be in some trouble. Billy's missing...
- He's in jail.

459
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,217
- Jail?
- Drunk.

460
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:43,840
Why that miserable...

461
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,760
Do you know how close he came to naming
all his soon to be rich friends to the whole town?

462
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,560
No.

463
00:47:47,983 --> 00:47:48,910
That close.

464
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,810
Well,  I'll guarantee that
he'll never take another drop.

465
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,950
You'll guarantee that when he
gets his shaky hands...

466
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,770
on some dynamite he won't
blow us all sky high?

467
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:58,070
- As far as his work goes,
he knows what he's doin'.

468
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,230
I don't care what he knows.

469
00:47:59,658 --> 00:48:01,350
I've stayed alive this long
by what I know.

470
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,860
And that is not to rely on anybody.
I always go it alone.

471
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:06,363
Precious?

472
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:09,407
Always?

473
00:48:09,918 --> 00:48:11,874
Is anything wrong?

474
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:13,868
No, baby.

475
00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:21,297
You just straighten out that kid.
You know Pierce upped the ante on you.

476
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,422
You're worth 12,000 to me. Dead.

477
00:48:25,137 --> 00:48:26,513
And 100,000 alive.

478
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,183
One's a gamble. Other's a sure thing.

479
00:48:30,602 --> 00:48:33,306
Lomax, nothin's a sure thing.

480
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,057
Precious?

481
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:44,030
Well, I didn't feel much like shootin' you
this morning anyway, partner.

482
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:47,364
Neither did I... "Precious".

483
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,446
Hey!

484
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,934
I haven't got time
to tell you what's on my mind.

485
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,276
Get out to Wes's place, and wait for me.

486
00:49:55,134 --> 00:49:57,672
Supposed to meet Taw here.

487
00:49:58,386 --> 00:50:00,344
How's your hand?

488
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:06,012
- I said, how's your hand.
- Fine.

489
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:11,231
Wes is due back any time.
You best wait in the house.

490
00:50:13,024 --> 00:50:16,397
- Don't he let you talk to anybody?
- To nobody.

491
00:50:16,823 --> 00:50:20,686
Reckon you can talk to me, then.
I'm nobody.

492
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:25,024
- How old are yuh?
- Eighteen, I think.

493
00:50:25,662 --> 00:50:28,034
Me too... far as I know.

494
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:36,251
Say...
how come you're married to Wes?

495
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:40,129
I ain't, really. He bartered me.

496
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,580
Bartered yuh?

497
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:47,514
Folks traded me for twenty dollars
and a horse. They's poor.

498
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,595
I'd call that a lot worse than poor.

499
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:59,853
Ain't much never mind.
About same here as it was with them.

500
00:51:00,277 --> 00:51:04,487
- Do your work and keep your mouth shut.
- Twenty dollars and a horse.

501
00:51:06,326 --> 00:51:07,439
Seems to me you're worth...

502
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,698
a little more than that.

503
00:51:14,997 --> 00:51:16,991
How come you're in on this stealin'?

504
00:51:18,417 --> 00:51:20,079
For the money.

505
00:51:20,504 --> 00:51:26,378
I'm gonna have me 100,000 dollars.
That'll make me a very important person.

506
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:28,165
Why?

507
00:51:31,513 --> 00:51:32,627
'Cause it will.

508
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:38,400
(Fletcher arriving):
Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!

509
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,644
Get up, mule! Ya! Whoa.

510
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:44,765
- What are you doin' here?
- Taw told me to meet him here.

511
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,000
- Did he tell you to hang around my wife?

512
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,570
What'd ya expect me to do?
Wait up on top of the mountain, someplace?

513
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:52,090
Don't sass me, boy.
Girl: He ain't done nothin'.

514
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,490
Will you get back to work! Go on!

515
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,488
Leave her alone!

516
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,154
- Come on, boy.
- Fletcher! Put it away.

517
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,043
Come here, Billy.

518
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:18,790
Billy,
from now on...

519
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:23,800
you're not going to say a word,
you're not gonna make a move, unless I tell yuh.

520
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,700
You get that?

521
00:52:27,268 --> 00:52:29,062
You go over the route?
- Yeah.

522
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,660
What are yuh gonna need?

523
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,060
First, I gotta know, how long is the war wagon,
from the lead horse back end?

524
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:38,066
Forty-seven and a half feet.

525
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,654
Then, I'll need about 500 feet of two-ounce
hemp twine, four bottles of gin...

526
00:52:44,076 --> 00:52:45,237
Gin?

527
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,850
You said time is the most important thing,
didn't yuh?

528
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:48,850
That's right.

529
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:52,286
So then I ain't figuring on dynamite.
Fuses don't burn that dependable.

530
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,079
- What are you figurin' on?
- Nitroglycerin.

531
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:58,125
Nitro?

532
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,210
- Wes!
- Yeah.

533
00:53:03,804 --> 00:53:05,925
He's figurin' on usin' nitroglycerin.

534
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:07,630
You know where there is any?

535
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,630
Yeah, Pierce has got some,
he uses it at the mine.

536
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:13,720
- Where does he keep it?
- At your ranch, in a safe.

537
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:17,845
- In a safe? You know the combination?
-No.

538
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:20,352
Let me show yuh somethin'.

539
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:25,500
Ever see a shell like this before?

540
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,900
Yeah.

541
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:32,026
Well, I took in 10,000 rounds
to Pierce last week.

542
00:53:33,995 --> 00:53:36,665
A Gatling gun.

543
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,660
Whiskey.

544
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,660
Mr. Pierce?

545
00:54:27,462 --> 00:54:30,747
I just seen Taw Jackson go in the
Lucky Deuce, and Lomax is in there.

546
00:54:32,048 --> 00:54:36,464
Get the sheriff.
I want this whole thing to be legal.

547
00:54:57,821 --> 00:55:01,438
Bartender, set 'em up on me.

548
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:05,649
I buy my own.

549
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,661
You refusing my hospitality?

550
00:55:16,715 --> 00:55:18,455
I'm ignoring it.

551
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:22,167
Well, I take that as an insult.

552
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:25,673
You take it any way you want.

553
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:44,940
Whiskey!

554
00:55:46,197 --> 00:55:48,070
I said, whiskey!

555
00:55:48,698 --> 00:55:52,235
- We don't serve Indians.
- Then I serve myself.

556
00:55:52,662 --> 00:55:54,368
- Have one with me.
- Sure.

557
00:55:54,786 --> 00:55:56,285
No thanks!

558
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:00,655
- You too good to drink with Indian?
- That's right.

559
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,150
Fight!

560
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,850
(Woman screaming)

561
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,850
Oh!

562
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,350
(More screaming)

563
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,350
Oh!

564
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,350
Uh!

565
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:04,501
Oh no!

566
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:17,500
("Oh, Suzanna" begins playing on piano)

567
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

568
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Oaf!

569
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:24,411
- You might say I saved your life.
- Yeah!

570
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:28,917
- What you do that for?
- Get the horses!

571
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,400
Pierce! I'm the one you hired
to kill Taw Jackson.

572
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,990
You trying go back on your deal?

573
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:50,900
Why didn't you shoot him
when you had the chance?

574
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,050
What chance?
He never went for his gun.

575
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,907
- What are yuh gonna' do?
- I'm goin' after him.

576
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:15,424
Lomax!

577
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:22,627
What sort of stupid stunt was that,
walking into the saloon that way.

578
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:25,382
- We need you tonight.
- I wasn't suppose to join till morning.

579
00:59:25,977 --> 00:59:28,512
The plans have changed. The kid wants to use nitro.

580
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:32,732
- Nitroglycerin?
- Which is in a safe you'll have to open.

581
00:59:33,148 --> 00:59:37,527
Forget it! I'm not gonna be anywhere
near that drunk kid and nitro.

582
00:59:37,946 --> 00:59:39,107
Lomax, that cut's it!

583
00:59:39,779 --> 00:59:42,532
Nobody takes a half a million sittin'
on their backside.

584
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:45,819
Either you quit acting like a prima donna,
or we call the whole thing off.

585
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:51,180
- Alright. It'll cost ya 2,000 more,
your share.

586
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,780
- Not my end, it won't.
- Then let's forget it.

587
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:54,451
You can have 2,000 of mine.

588
00:59:56,836 --> 00:59:59,706
- You're a good Indian.
- Alright, Levi.

589
01:00:00,132 --> 01:00:03,165
Go pick up Wild Horse.
We'll get the kid.

590
01:00:09,137 --> 01:00:10,302
Hey, Taw.

591
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,470
For a minute back there at the saloon,
I thought you were gonna draw.

592
01:00:17,898 --> 01:00:20,303
For a minute back there,
I was.

593
01:00:30,031 --> 01:00:32,022
It'll be that shack on the left.

594
01:00:35,118 --> 01:00:36,401
What a place.

595
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:38,120
Yeah.

596
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:42,780
Well, might as well relax till dark.

597
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:45,284
Nitroglycerin!

598
01:01:44,764 --> 01:01:45,961
Don't!

599
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:52,766
You got five minutes.

600
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,388
Get goin'.

601
01:02:11,206 --> 01:02:12,912
- That you, Frenchy?
- Yeah.

602
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:18,500
- What's up?
- You want a cup of coffee.

603
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,040
"I want a cup of coffee."

604
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,246
Yeah, me too.

605
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:28,010
Just leave it,
right there.

606
01:03:38,951 --> 01:03:41,106
Sure you know what you're doin'?

607
01:03:47,874 --> 01:03:51,325
That's far enough.
You two get over in the corner.

608
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,952
Now, Shack, get rid of that gun,
nice and easy.

609
01:04:00,512 --> 01:04:02,834
What are you doin' here?

610
01:04:03,263 --> 01:04:04,883
Just visitin'.

611
01:04:06,184 --> 01:04:08,970
- And I've gotta give you credit.
- For what?

612
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:13,061
For your good taste.
You haven't changed a thing.

613
01:04:14,357 --> 01:04:17,693
- What do you want?
- My belongings.

614
01:04:18,278 --> 01:04:21,976
- Everything in here belongs to me.
- How about my clothes?

615
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:25,941
- I burned them.
- Even those in the attic, in the trunk?

616
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:29,573
- There's nothin' up there but an old pair...
- Why don't you go get it?

617
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:33,197
- We'll wait here.
- Do what the man says.

618
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,999
Just exactly!

619
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,747
Yes, sir.

620
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,340
It could take a little time.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?

621
01:04:48,971 --> 01:04:50,345
I'm comfortable.

622
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,402
Well?

623
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:09,114
Yeah.

624
01:05:12,657 --> 01:05:14,315
Careful!

625
01:05:47,606 --> 01:05:50,560
- Does it always smoke like that?
- Huh?

626
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:54,945
Does it always smoke like that?

627
01:05:56,284 --> 01:05:58,074
Yeah.

628
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:16,959
- These what you mean?
- That's it.

629
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:21,167
- You'd risk your neck for those rags?
- Whose neck?

630
01:06:43,489 --> 01:06:45,645
We've got two minutes.

631
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,449
Get going.

632
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:08,507
- Thanks for your hospitality.
- Glad you got what you came for.

633
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,885
So am I.

634
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,890
Oh, ah...

635
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:16,061
Don't anybody get too anxious
to go out this door.

636
01:07:20,478 --> 01:07:23,433
Well, don't stand there,
go get him.

637
01:07:23,857 --> 01:07:25,932
Yes, Sir.
Come on!

638
01:07:35,871 --> 01:07:39,655
Bunkhouse!
It's Taw Jackson. Get him!

639
01:08:30,169 --> 01:08:33,866
- Where are they goin'?
- Pierce has run 'em out.

640
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,881
All except Wild Horse.

641
01:09:33,684 --> 01:09:35,640
Bring her on out!

642
01:09:53,491 --> 01:09:58,319
- That's really something, Mr Pierce.
- She's practically a piece of heavy artillery.

643
01:10:48,205 --> 01:10:50,827
- Alright, load her up and let's get moving.
- Yes, sir.

644
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:53,326
Load her up!

645
01:11:33,704 --> 01:11:36,827
- Everything set with Wild Horse?
- He's on his way.

646
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:42,747
It's that time.

647
01:13:29,645 --> 01:13:31,303
- Come on!
- Yeah.

648
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,303
- Hold it steady.
- I'm tryin'.

649
01:15:01,555 --> 01:15:07,096
- How hot's it get around here?
- Ninety, ninety-five. Sometimes more.

650
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:13,978
You better get me a canteen, then,
so as I can water them down a little.

651
01:15:15,402 --> 01:15:16,946
Yeah.

652
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:10,961
- You need any more help?
- I can rig the twine.

653
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:14,959
- I'll just wet 'em down once more.
- I'll see ya later.

654
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:00,341
I got it.

655
01:19:31,963 --> 01:19:35,214
- It's the next ravine, Wes.
- Right.

656
01:19:56,946 --> 01:20:00,809
- We're running a little late.
- It's that extra weight, Mr Pierce.

657
01:20:10,749 --> 01:20:14,495
- How's it going?
- I'll be ready.

658
01:20:56,373 --> 01:20:58,997
- What's that?
- The Kiowa tribe.

659
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:01,659
Pierce has got 'em beat.
They're moving out.

660
01:21:08,551 --> 01:21:12,761
Look's like
Wild Horse's men are ready.

661
01:21:36,743 --> 01:21:39,494
You think he's gonna fall
for that old dust routine?

662
01:21:39,912 --> 01:21:44,155
You better hope so.
You got 100,000 ridin' on it.

663
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:10,430
- Mr Pierce!
- Yeah?

664
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,230
We're bein' followed.

665
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:14,723
Looks like the whole Kiowa tribe.

666
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:22,851
Have the riders drop back!

667
01:22:24,574 --> 01:22:26,285
Everybody pull back!

668
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,640
Hold it!

669
01:22:58,232 --> 01:23:00,557
Let's get back to the wagon.

670
01:23:09,449 --> 01:23:11,158
- Well.
- Yeah.

671
01:23:24,255 --> 01:23:27,088
- What's goin' on back there?
- I don't know, Mr Pierce.

672
01:23:27,506 --> 01:23:29,382
But it looks like the boys
are comin' back.

673
01:23:57,074 --> 01:24:00,738
Indians don't blow up bridges.
Knock on it!

674
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:04,365
- There's a crossing upriver.
- That's about three miles away.

675
01:24:04,788 --> 01:24:07,991
We got no choice.
Let's go.

676
01:24:40,864 --> 01:24:43,021
Mr Pierce!
Look!

677
01:25:03,259 --> 01:25:05,712
Gimme a hand here.

678
01:25:46,461 --> 01:25:47,709
That oughta hold 'em.

679
01:25:55,598 --> 01:25:56,927
Let's go.

680
01:26:18,785 --> 01:26:20,407
We're goin' the wrong way.

681
01:26:22,289 --> 01:26:23,319
Here they come.

682
01:26:23,746 --> 01:26:25,286
We're on the wrong road.

683
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,207
What the hell...

684
01:27:01,947 --> 01:27:03,190
Let's get out of here!

685
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:05,690
- You're hired to guard this gold.
- Not me!

686
01:27:09,705 --> 01:27:12,619
- He's right, Mr Pierce.
- You too?

687
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:25,919
I'm gonna dump it in this gulch!

688
01:27:28,304 --> 01:27:29,335
Jump!

689
01:28:20,933 --> 01:28:23,260
Look like you'll get your ranch back.

690
01:28:40,078 --> 01:28:41,356
Get those barrel tops off.

691
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:49,924
That looks mighty pretty.

692
01:29:57,521 --> 01:29:58,599
Alright, give me a hand.

693
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,650
Taw, that's the last of it.

694
01:31:40,612 --> 01:31:43,066
Well, get goin'.
Take it easy.

695
01:31:44,991 --> 01:31:46,022
Taw!

696
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:11,390
Yatahay!

697
01:32:14,891 --> 01:32:17,181
He says to keep our hands
away from our guns.

698
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:22,309
Dirty, double-crossin'...

699
01:32:30,407 --> 01:32:31,650
You leave that be!

700
01:32:52,886 --> 01:32:54,627
Know what you're always sayin' about me?

701
01:32:56,556 --> 01:32:59,344
Yeah, if we're all gonna die,
let's have one last drink.

702
01:32:59,809 --> 01:33:02,429
- Is that...?
- Yep!

703
01:33:04,353 --> 01:33:05,515
After you, Taw.

704
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:10,730
Don't mind if I do.

705
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,764
Get that wagon!

706
01:34:19,631 --> 01:34:21,621
Indian expert!

707
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:32,620
Yah!

708
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:35,120
Yah!

709
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:50,120
Hyah!

710
01:36:55,470 --> 01:36:58,480
They're picking us clean.
Why didn't you stop them?

711
01:36:58,853 --> 01:37:00,681
Well, just how do I go about that?

712
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:03,520
I'm afraid Taw's right, Lomax.
They'll fight you.

713
01:37:03,648 --> 01:37:06,580
- Shut up, you Indian!
- I know my people.

714
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:08,730
- To them it's flour.
- What about the gold?

715
01:37:08,863 --> 01:37:11,066
- For all they know, it's just food.
- Great, just great!

716
01:37:11,487 --> 01:37:15,616
I'm out 100,000, my share and 2,000 from Levi.
Where are you goin'?

717
01:37:17,078 --> 01:37:18,325
Back to my people.

718
01:37:18,955 --> 01:37:22,285
And what am I supposed to do? Live with the
Indians for the next year and open up a bakery?

719
01:37:22,705 --> 01:37:26,190
With Pierce dead, it don't even pay
to kill you any more.

720
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:27,490
Wait a minute...

721
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,350
You owe me $100 a day and plus 500
when I used my gun. That's $1,200.

722
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,440
I'm calling in your mark.

723
01:37:33,508 --> 01:37:34,920
- Now?
- Now!

724
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:39,633
I haven't got that kind of money.
The only thing I own is standing right there.

725
01:37:43,184 --> 01:37:44,920
- I'll take it.
- My horse?

726
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,220
You're damn right.

727
01:37:46,649 --> 01:37:51,960
You'd leave me out here, 30 miles from nowhere,
without a horse? Penniless?

728
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:55,475
That's your problem, partner.

729
01:38:26,472 --> 01:38:27,770
What happened?

730
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:30,170
Well, we lost part of it.
Toss me those saddlebags.

731
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:42,145
We'll still meet...

732
01:38:42,569 --> 01:38:44,380
in six months and divide it.

733
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:47,280
But in the meantime, 
you'll have to have something to live on.

734
01:38:52,536 --> 01:38:55,906
- Be careful where you spend it.
- We will.

735
01:38:57,876 --> 01:38:59,251
Thanks, Taw.

736
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,650
Billy!

737
01:39:06,549 --> 01:39:10,130
When you catch up with Lomax,
tell him where you got it.

738
01:39:10,887 --> 01:39:13,806
- He's gonna be mad.
- Yeah.

739
01:39:28,071 --> 01:39:31,540
- How much? And what did you do with it?
- 100,000. I hid it.

740
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,640
Where?

741
01:39:33,074 --> 01:39:35,442
- I'll let you know in about six months.
- Six months!

742
01:39:36,579 --> 01:39:39,448
- I want it now.
- It wouldn't be very smart...

743
01:39:39,871 --> 01:39:43,571
to start flashing gold dust around
right after a robbery, would it?

744
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,418
- What am I supposed to do till then?
- Well for one thing...

745
01:39:48,465 --> 01:39:51,994
 you better
make damn sure I stay alive.

746
01:39:55,927 --> 01:39:59,974
- Thats a 24-hour-a-day job.
- That's your problem, partner.
