 your town, Ned.                

348
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:18,385
Flora, bring his partner along. 
     We'll show 'em.            

349
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:21,255
                Come along,     
                Mr. Garvin.     

350
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:24,424
Luther, you stay here           
and guard that press.           

351
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:25,959
You ought to let us know        
you were coming.                

352
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,262
We'd have had brass bands       
and parties galore.             

353
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,330
              I have            
           no ties here.        

354
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,104
Old man Brooks                  
went into bankruptcy            

355
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,473
like most of the people         
in the town.                    

356
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,475
Only he didn't live             
to suffer from it.              

357
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,943
          And his daughter, Amy?

358
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,012
She moved to                    
greener pastures.               

359
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,713
 You never heard                
 from her, Ned?                 

360
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:48,315
                   Once.        

361
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:51,819
                She returned    
            our engagement ring.

362
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,888
               I got it at      
        the Battle of Five Forks

363
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,856
                    just before 
                  Richmond fell.

364
00:17:58,126 --> 00:17:59,393
  Forget her, Ned.              

365
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,061
                    I have.     

366
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,374
  Here you are, gents.          
       Drink up.                

367
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,477
          Ned...                

368
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:19,279
      there's the world:        

369
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,849
                         Texas. 

370
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,617
           You own Texas,       
      and you can buy the rest. 

371
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,651
            And here...         

372
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:25,886
            right here,         

373
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:28,088
      is where all its treasures
         are gonna crisscross,  

374
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,692
      going east and west,      
and north and south: Fort Worth.

375
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,961
   Gents, you are standing on   
the hub of the nation right now.

376
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:37,464
 Uh-- Your axle's               
     busted.                    

377
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,200
Well, you're                    
dead right.                     

378
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,102
Mice are starving               
in this town.                   

379
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,938
My creditors look like          
an army roll call.              

380
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,474
But I'm giving it               
to you dark, boys.              

381
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:49,610
You see, Mr. Garvin,            
I don't want anybody            

382
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:52,479
who's looking for               
a ready-made paradise.          

383
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,080
I know Ned's                    
courage.                        

384
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,250
I envied him out there,         
fighting the battles.           

385
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:57,551
              You did your part.

386
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,953
           We'd have starved    
      without you and your kind.

387
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:03,357
    Let's be level, Ned.        
   They paid for my beef.       

388
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,992
     Oh, I put my head          
 on a block right enough...     

389
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:08,128
   running the gulf             
and through the lines.          

390
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,630
  But when the war ended,       

391
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,331
   I had a small fortune.       

392
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,267
                 That came      
              without asking.   

393
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:16,536
   Well, I didn't think much    
about it until it was all over. 

394
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:19,356
         And then I saw         
        what I could do.        

395
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,523
      Bring the railroad in     

396
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:23,460
    and make this the richest   
       county in the state.     

397
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:27,130
  Unfortunately, the railway    
  company wasn't impressed.     

398
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,932
   "What have you got to        
   freight?" they said.         

399
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,634
       And Blair said, "Cattle. 
     We'll build a packing plant

400
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:33,337
         and ship it all the way
            from Fort Worth."   

401
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,671
That's a great                  
idea.                           

402
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,039
           Is it, Ned?          

403
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,608
        Every cent I own        
         is sunk in it.         

404
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,878
     An empty packing plant     
   big enough for Kansas City   

405
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,645
       right out there          
    on the outskirts of town.   

406
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:45,815
         Panic stopped          
   the railroad from coming in. 

407
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,618
    Why not haul to Dallas,     
       ship from there?         

408
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,238
      That's the remark         
  of a foreigner, Mr. Garvin.   

409
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,909
            Even if Dallas      
     wasn't cotton and industry,

410
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:58,345
    we still wouldn't make 'em  
  a gift of our cattle business.

411
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,846
                    Oh, we'll do
                     all right, 

412
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:01,815
              once we break     
        Clevenger's terrorizing.

413
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:03,850
    He knows he'll have         
 no trail-driving contracts     

414
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:05,118
once we get rails.              

415
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,253
He keeps the panic going,       
but we'll beat him.             

416
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:08,939
  Ned pulling double with me... 

417
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,641
          we can beat           
      a dozen Clevengers.       

418
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,060
And with                        
your paper,                     

419
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,762
put some fat on the bones       
of this town.                   

420
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:16,430
Enough to guarantee             
the freight                     

421
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:17,548
to bring the railroad           
      to us.

423
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:29,492
We'll make our noise            
heard across the state.         

424
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:34,431
We'll get us                    
our own governor in Austin.     

425
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,166
              You, Mr. Lunsford?

426
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,368
  [CHUCKLES]                    

427
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,369
BLAIR:                          
Why not?                        

428
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,105
But I'll need                   
your paper.                     

429
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,256
      And I'll need             
      your guns, Ned.           

430
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:46,309
The whole suffering             
county needs 'em.               

431
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,612
              Don't look, Blair.

432
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,313
            He never wears them.

433
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,715
           What?                

434
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,220
What have they done             
to you, Ned?                    

435
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,357
            Flora will tell you.
               Come on, Ben.    

436
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,825
                           Yes, 
                          go on.

437
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,428
        Go as far south and west
            as you like, Ned.   

438
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,096
             And I hope you hear
                 the beating    

439
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,432
          of the hoofs of cattle
              in your sleep.    

440
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,370
        I'd just as leave       
        set up shop here        

441
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,571

            a partner.

443
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,657
   And a penny newspaper.       

444
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,592
   Sounds cheap, don't it?      

445
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:21,861
   But a penny newspaper        
     can make or break          

446
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,830
the millionaire's               
dollar power on Earth,          

447
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:26,099
turn the beam                   
on them that shine,             

448
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,951
drive the vermin                
to their holes.

00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,404
Why, I can bring                
good people to this town        

450
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:32,239
like moths drawn                
to the light.

00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:33,706
                That's kind of  
               high-flown, Ben.

              Mind if I put it  
                  simpler?      

453
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:37,144
No. Go ahead.

 delouse this burg.

00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:08,076
    Dad would've                
  kicked the bung               

1132
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,444
 out of a barrel                
     of mash                    

1133
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,679
celebratin' the gunnin'         
you gave Clevenger's men        

1134
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,181
at the stockyard.               

1135
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,433
                  I wonder      
                if Ben would.   

1136
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:16,801
               I still believe  
               the printed word 

1137
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:17,836
                   is stronger  
                   than guns.   

1138
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,204
                    Only seeing 
                    him dead... 

1139
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:22,407
Makes a difference              
when it's a friend.             

1140
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:24,743
        Been you                
     instead of Ben...          

1141
00:54:24,745 --> 00:54:27,111
 I'd be on Clevenger's          
     trail myself.              

1142
00:54:28,063 --> 00:54:29,313
                     If it'd    
                   been Blair?  

1143
00:54:31,484 --> 00:54:33,518
    Yes, I'd fight              
      for Blair.                

1144
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,220
   I'm not a schoolgirl         
   that never heard of          

1145
00:54:35,222 --> 00:54:37,288
  all the Amy Brookses          
     in the world.              

1146
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,359
               Blair's walkin'  
            in four-leaf clover,

1147
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,695
               having a woman   
           so broad in the mind.

1148
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,996
                         Hm.    

1149
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:47,565
           You ought to thank me
           for bringin' Amy out.

1150
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:50,068
Tell the truth,                 
I felt sorry for her.           

1151
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,739
Her kind have their day,        
but it sure ends fast.          

1152
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:56,541
 She's got claws,               
     though.                    

1153
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,326
     She got to me              
 when she talked about          

1154
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,994
  the dollar marks              
    in my eyes.                 

1155
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,629
                   Oh, don't you
                    believe it. 

1156
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,598
 I took a quick look            
   at my bankbook.              

1157
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,232
     That was                   
 reassuring enough.             

1158
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:07,602
Any dollar marks                
I've got are red ink.           

1159
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:08,870
                         That'll
                         change.

1160
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,822
                   The railroad 
                  comes through,

1161
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:12,491
Blair's packing plant           
starts humming,                 

1162
00:55:12,493 --> 00:55:14,659
and you'll be                   
fat as a goose.                 

1163
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:16,260
                If that's meant 
               for a compliment,

1164
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:17,361
                you've got a lot
                    to learn.   

1165
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:22,834
            Don't keep yourself 
           such a stranger, Ned.

1166
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:24,502
                It gets lonesome
                   out there.   

1167
00:55:24,504 --> 00:55:25,837
Blair will                      
keep you company.               

1168
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,056
                Blair's not     
            on my visiting list.

1169
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,190
But you just said--             

1170
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,059
                     I said that
                       to you.  

1171
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,277
                You don't think 
                for one minute  

1172
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:34,312
                  I'm not gonna 
                make him squirm.

1173
00:55:36,365 --> 00:55:40,035
Maybe his clover crop           
ain't as thick as I figured.    

1174
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,769
                     By the way,
                    where is he?

1175
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:43,571
   Far as I know,               
  still in Dallas.              

1176
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,273
                   Dallas?      
                  What for?     

1177
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,942
Ah, don't worry.                
It's not another Amy.           

1178
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,611
      He's arguing              
  the railroad through.         

1179
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:53,781
          If he does that, I'll 
         forgive him awful fast.

1180
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:08,313
                  Come out      
               any time, Ned.   

1181
00:56:08,315 --> 00:56:09,781
                  Don't wait    
             for the invitation.

1182
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,016
    I won't.                    

1183
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:13,418
I can't pass up the kind        
of local news you handle.       

1184
00:56:18,056 --> 00:56:19,056
                   Good morning,
                       Flora.   

1185
00:56:19,058 --> 00:56:20,091
      How are you,              
         Blair?                 

1186
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:39,227
                You're beginning
                     to look    

1187
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,763
            more like a lovesick
               bull every day.  

1188
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,098
                        What's  
                     the matter?

1189
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,466
                 Won't Flora moo
                when you bellow?

1190
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,834
Don't swing                     
on the gate, sonny.             

1191
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,686
You might get                   
a bellyful of horns.            

1192
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:53,875
           You may as well      
       get yourself reconciled. 

1193
00:56:55,627 --> 00:56:57,078
                I'm the one     
             she's gonna marry. 

1194
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,280
Why? Because                    
she spoke to you?               

1195
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,015
I heard her say hello           
to a yapping dog                

1196
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,650
out on the trail.               

1197
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:06,154
        Oh, I guess I can savvy 
      an insult when I hear one.

1198
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,323
            I don't have to have
             a barn fall on me. 

1199
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,792
               But that's no way
               to treat a fellow

1200
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,493
             that's bringing you
              some bang-up news.

1201
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:15,563
You won your argument           
with the railroad.              

1202
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,899
                No. I lost it   
                 hands down.    

1203
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,868
                Clevenger's men 
              shot up the train.

1204
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,337
              There ain't nobody
                can take a hint 

1205
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,771
                     faster than
                    railroaders.

1206
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,641
 That's hard news,              
      Blair.                    

1207
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,543
Fort Worth will die without--   
                    [DOOR OPENS]

1208
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,710
                      LUTHER:   
                   Mr. Lunsford?

1209
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:31,980
                 Yeah, son?     

1210
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,998
           I owe you an apology,
               Mr. Lunsford.    

1211
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:37,802
Well, that's                    
a manly thing to say.           

1212
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,120
   What for?                    

1213
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,022
               Well, I've been  
             distrustful of you.

1214
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,825
       But that meeting over at 
      the hotel proved me wrong.

1215
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:47,378
I told you I had                
some real hot news.             

1216
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,629
          What meeting?         

1217
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,064
                    The Panthers
                        Club.   

1218
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,933
                 We're going to 
               get the railroad.

1219
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,235
    They're gonna get their own 
      free labor to lay track.  

1220
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,571
   And Mr. Walter and the other 
    deputies will protect 'em   

1221
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,073
          against Clevenger...  
          o-or anybody else.    

1222
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,109
   But it was Mr. Lunsford here 
      who got 'em up to it.     

1223
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:03,678
                       I'm proud
                        of 'em. 

1224
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,279
                   You should be
                     too, Ned.  

1225
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,115
               You created them,
                    kind of.    

1226
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:08,683
                         They're
                        big now.

1227
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,919
                Better than 200 
              good grizzly boys.

1228
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,554
             I gotta            
            set type.           

1229
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:13,889
They got                        
the muscles maybe,              

1230
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:17,025
but it takes cash to pay        
for feed and materials.         

1231
00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:21,796
             Here's another item
              for Luther to set.

1232
00:58:24,466 --> 00:58:26,101

 Want to stay out               
  of the crowds?

You'll have to
