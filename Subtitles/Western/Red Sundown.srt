1
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:28,182
Water!

2
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,060
Wait.

3
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,618
Do not be a pig.

4
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,455
I don't no know how long I coulda held out.

5
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,530
You are Alec Longmire, ain't ya?
Yes

6
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,168
I'm Bud Purvis.

7
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:52,806
Heard they got ya at Mobeetie.

8
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:55,622
I'm a hard man to hold.

9
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:57,522
Where ya headed?

10
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,041
You tell me.

11
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,119
Paseo?

12
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,757
Good enough.

13
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:27,201
I've heard plenty about your kickaroo draw.
They say it's the fastest yet.

14
00:03:27,202 --> 00:03:29,080
Just tricky.

15
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,598
When I was your age,
I thought of nothin' else.

16
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,777
Used to practice the
draw 2 or 3 hours a day.

17
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,175
So did my brother Mike.
He's dead.

18
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,991
It makes ya think.

19
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:42,771
Sure does.

20
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,788
Mike used to ride with McCormick, didn't he?

21
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:48,027
Yeah, a long time.

22
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,966
They got McCormick last week.

23
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:55,243
I was with him.

24
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,491
Hey.. uh, where we can wash up?
-Out there.

25
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:55,361
You go ahead.
-Alright.

26
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:02,236
Wow, there's nothing like it.

27
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:12,928
I'm kinda hungry.
How 'bout you?

28
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:15,646
I ain't eaten since I left Mobeetie last night

29
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,884
'It's about time then.
-I'm fresh outta cash.

30
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,584
Forget it.

31
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,476
Somebody's gettin' up steam for a big night.

32
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:33,215
Sounds like they got a head start...

33
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:36,952
Come on, set 'em up on him.

34
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:39,349
That's what he thinks.
This time it's on you!

35
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,409
Frank, should see your face!

36
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:44,587
You know I'll tell you something,
If he wasn't my brother I'd...

37
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:48,764
-Come on, what are you waiting for?
-We came all the way to St. Louis to get that deck boys.

38
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:54,881
Come on, cut 'em loss!

39
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,198
This table's taken mister.

40
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:02,635
Yeah, I took it. Okay?

41
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:09,470
I asked you if it was ok.

42
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,909
My brother asked you a question.

43
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,064
That's no kinda answer.

44
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:25,339
Come on, Alec.

45
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,869
Anybody home?

46
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,221
This is the end of the line..

47
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,799
These horses are beat and so am I.

48
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,516
I'll bet you got a sack of coffee in that bedroll.
.

49
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:27,375
They'd spot smoke
5 miles away.

50
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:30,893
I sure am hungry.

51
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:34,029
I got some bread and a jar of strawberry jam.

52
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,369
Well, what are you waiting for?

53
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:58,634
This place sure looks deserted.

54
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,569
I must be getting old.

55
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,567
I remember once I could take
all this and think nothin' of it.

56
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,406
I'm a little beat myself.

57
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:12,544
Naw, naw, I mean old inside.

58
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:17,101
Just think, last night I was waitin' my trial in Mobeetie.

59
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:22,357
Until you showed up, I wasn't sure, but
what I'd been better off stayin' there.

60
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:25,415
We're not in the clear yet. Here.
Thanks.

61
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,850
'Hmm', that sure is good.
There's nothing like strawberry.

62
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:42,542
Where were you goin', when you picked me up?

63
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,602
Just givin' the horse his head.

64
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,859
That what started me.

65
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,878
I took a job once.
Worked a while, got restless and then drifted.

66
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:55,715
I had a chance to pick up some easy dough with my gun.
I took that too.

67
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:01,290
You know what I'd do,
if I had it to do all over again?

68
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,449
What?

69
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,427
I'd get me a real job and stick with it.

70
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:10,225
30 and keep?
I'd even work up for less.

71
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:13,903
I've hired my gun a lot of times
and made plenty with it.

72
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,258
And now I even got the
makin's to show for it.

73
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:27,613
Thanks.

74
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,594
No, sir...

75
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:35,595
not even the makin's.

76
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,404
Down there .

77
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:45,748
Spot! Wake up!

78
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:47,729
Get outta the door.

79
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,411
Hold this against ya. Tight!

80
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:24,336
You'll feel better stretched out on the bunk.

81
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:31,658
Maybe it's not as bad as you think.
- Do not kid me!

82
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,701
Do not waste lead.
We'll sweat them out..

83
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,802
I've been with a lot of men when they died...

84
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:00,841
I've heard 'em laugh at the end.

85
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:03,943
I've heard 'em curse and whine.

86
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:08,843
I was with Joe McCormick when he got his.
He shore went slow.

87
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:13,884
He kept lookin' back on his life and tying to
place the blame for the mess he'd made of it.

88
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:16,205
You know what I think?
- What Bud?

89
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:19,027
We ain't got no one to blame but ourselves.

90
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:27,388
Alec! I been thinking.
Dig yourself a grave.

91
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:28,968
What?

92
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,688
Yeah, about 2 feet deep.
I'll cover ya up...

93
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:35,730
and leave an old tin can or a piece of
stove pipe stickin' out so you can breath.

94
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,410
When they rush us, I hold 'em off.
They'll think you got out some other way.

95
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:41,831
And I leave ya to them huh?

96
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:45,952
I ain't got a prayer and you know it.
Do what I tell ya!.

97
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,872
Why don't you get back on that bunk?

98
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:52,052
You never hear of anybody makin'
it with a bullet in his gut.

99
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:53,493
Come on.

100
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:55,612
I'm doing this to give you a chance.

101
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:59,814
All my life I've been at it.
A big hero, fast on the draw.

102
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:03,196
Kids taggin' after me in every town,
like I wore a medal.

103
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,635
Look what it's got me.

104
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,796
They sure weren't very considerate,
where they plugged me..

105
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:12,336
A guy warned me once...
like I'm tryin' to warn you now Alec...

106
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:16,456
but I wouldn't listen.
I was to big. Gimme your promise kid...

107
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:20,399
If you pull outta this, you'll quit livin' by the gun.
What do you say?

108
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,199
I promise.
-Good!

109
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:27,840
Go on now and get the shovel. Hurry up.

110
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,721
About 2 feet deep.

111
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:50,563
Is a pretty neat job kid.
Maybe you missed your callin'.

112
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:58,446
Hurry up.
I ain't got much time.

113
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,166
This is for Frank.

114
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,967
What was that?

115
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:14,467
Now put that tin can over the end of the pipe.

116
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:17,848
Angle it under the wall
so you can breathe from the outside.

117
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:58,217
Here Alec.

118
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:01,018
Thanks.

119
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,140
This is all I got left from bein' a big man.

120
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:29,162
Do you think you'll be able to breath alright Alec?

121
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:32,063
Yeah Bud, it's okay.
-Alright.

122
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:56,727
Where are they?

123
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:59,468
They won't be long now.

124
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,991
Good luck to you kid.
Have a drink on me if you get outta here.

125
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,197
Where's the other one?

126
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,598
Are you comin' out?

127
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:50,719
He'll come out.

128
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,542
Well, where's the body?

129
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,364
Couldn't a been completely burned up.

130
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:23,605
Must've made it outta here.
Played us for chumps.

131
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,105
- What do we do now?
I do not know.

132
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:33,466
- What about this other guy?
-Leave 'im for the buzzards.

133
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,847
Come on. Let's get outta here.

134
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:31,888
Boy, you're gettin' good Lester.
Let me try one.

135
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:33,609
- Hughie!
- Yes, Mom?

136
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,929
If you keep that up you'll wake the baby
.

137
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,030
Okay, Mom.
Come on, Chuck.

138
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:48,851
Yes, sir.
That was good shootin'.

139
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:51,812
One of these days I'll buy me
a genuine sixgun.

140
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:56,354
They costs $ 17.
-Well... someday.

141
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:59,594
Let me carry it for awhile.

142
00:21:05,326 --> 00:21:08,044
Pow. Got him!
Right between the eyes.

143
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,164
Do you think Jade Murphy really
shot it out with Wild Bill Hickock?

144
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:13,963
Everyone say so.
-But he's still alive.

145
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:16,802
Wild Bill musta missed.
Not him.

146
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:19,183
You hear lots of things.

147
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,302
Who's that?

148
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,175
Hi.
Hi.

149
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:06,335
Say, that’s a nice rifle you got there.
Thanks.

150
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,633
How's the huntin' around here?
I do not know.

151
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:11,892
We just practice.

152
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,990
Did you see the way he walks?
Like a cat.

153
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,771
It's a sign he' plenty fast.

154
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,088
What's the matter?
Didn't you ever see a Gila monster before?

155
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,207
Yeah, but not in a saloon.

156
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,985
There's a case full of Rattlers
on the other side of the door.

157
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:51,305
Harry, give the man a drink.
-Sure.

158
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,625
Eddie Feltzer here is a good businessman.

159
00:22:53,626 --> 00:22:56,824
If a drunk staggers in and leans
up against one of those cases...

160
00:22:56,825 --> 00:23:00,524
9 out of 10 times he'll turn right
around and buy himself another drink.

161
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:04,703
My name is Murphy.
Jade Murphy.

162
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,022
I'm, uh, Alec Longmire, sheriff.

163
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:10,403
Alec Longmire huh??
I've heard about of you.

164
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:14,561
Now you'll go back to your office, go through
a pile of dodgers and see if I'm wanted huh.

165
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:17,401
Yeah, will I'll find ya?

166
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,120
Let's go see.

167
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,099
Finish your drink.

168
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,418
My Pop said he's tired of keepin' the
store and listening to women talk.

169
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:29,138
One of these days he's gonna take off.
I mean if Mom left him.

170
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:31,658
-Just across the street there.
-Hi, Mr. Murphy.

171
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:34,398
- How're you men? How ya doin'?
-Oh, just fine.

172
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:38,277
You don't suppose Jade's arresting 'im?

173
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:57,132
We don't have much trouble around here,
that is, from outsiders.

174
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,652
Trouble's the one thing I'm not lookin' for.

175
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,450
Well, you've got a reputation mister.

176
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:04,871
Call a man a dog, someone
throws a rock at 'im.

177
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:09,391
To save some time Sheriff I'm not wanted,
as far as I know, anywhere.

178
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,529
You're runnin' though.

179
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,049
Anybody likely to show up lookin' for ya?

180
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,070
If I knew that, I'd live a lot longer.
Wouldn't I?

181
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,029
No, I'm lookin' for a job.
Maybe Durango's the place.

182
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:23,247
Man's word's
good enough for me.

183
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:25,406
If I don't find a job, I'll move on.

184
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:27,367
Fair enough.
-I need a room.

185
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:30,307
Well, we got the Plains Hotel up on the corner.
Cheap and clean.

186
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:33,765
Besides, it's the only one we've got.
Come on, I'll introduce you.

187
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:35,426
Thanks.

188
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,843
'Hi ya, Mr. Murphy.
-Hello men.

189
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,723
Say, I just said hello to you.
What are ya up to?

190
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:43,684
Uh, who's your friend, Mr. Murphy?

191
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:46,962
Oh, sorry I didn't introduced myself gentlemen.
My name is Longmire.

192
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:50,042
You're not Mike Longmire?
No, I'm his brother, Alec.

193
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:52,622
I knew Mike's real fast,
Mr. Longmire?

194
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:56,342
Mike's dead.

195
00:24:57,641 --> 00:25:00,581
When I grow up, I'm gonna
be the fastest draw in Texas.

196
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:04,320
Some of the best men I know
can't draw a lick...

197
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:07,820
and some of the worst can
outdraw me from here to Sunday.

198
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:13,757
Now, what do ya suppose
he mean by that?

199
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,537
Folks say a lot of things I do not understand.

200
00:25:17,438 --> 00:25:21,156
-That was a nice thing you said to the boys.
-Aw, they probably didn't get it.

201
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:24,795
Some folks feel a man can't change
his ways, once the stamps on him

202
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:27,675
I am not one of them.
I thought you'd like to know.

203
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:30,095
What's all the wire for?

204
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:40,653
It's Ruf  Henshaw's.
He uh, he owns the Triple X Ranch out here.

205
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:44,813
He's gonna try to fence in the squatters and
small cowmen. They're not gonna to like it.

206
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:48,452
You blame 'em?
- You taking sides already?

207
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:51,430
You see, the titles aren't clear on more
than half this land around here, 'n ...

208
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:56,250
Henshaw is trying to grab a lot
of acreage don't belong to him
or there's some question about.

209
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,828
On the other hand, Sam Baldwin, Bert
Flynn and some of the other squatters have...

210
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:02,868
registered brands to cover his, like...

211
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:05,348
Four Diamonds, fits right over Triple X.

212
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:09,407
The same old story huh.
-Yep, and in the same old way, men'll die.

213
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:13,887
Alec... I need some help.
Would you be interested?

214
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:17,265
I'm lookin' for a nice quite job.
- $ 150 a month?

215
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:20,925
Better than you can do wrestling cattle.
Yeah, but cows don't shoot at you.

216
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,565
Come on .

217
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:26,445
Whose side the Sheriff on?

218
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:30,284
Well, that's a good question.

219
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:33,822
If I said I'd stay with the side that was right,
it wouldn't be much of an answer...

220
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,583
because there's right on both sides.

221
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:38,700
The way I look at it, it's up to the court
to decide on the right and the wrong

222
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:40,882
'Til then, my job's to keep peace.

223
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:44,121
So... I'm in the middle.
-It's a good way to get run over.

224
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,440
Son...

225
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,859
if you really want a job around
here, you don't have much choice.

226
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,799
The little outfits can't afford you, and
all Henshaw'll want is your gun.

227
00:26:57,538 --> 00:26:59,738
Not that he isn't pretty good with a gun himself...

228
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:02,198
he just doesn't like to get his hands dirty.

229
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:06,856
Why don't you come up to the house tonight for supper?
We'll talk about it.

230
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,276
Best invitation I had all day.

231
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,464
Who's he? Never seen him before.

232
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:57,044
I don't know.

233
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,099
Hello, Alec.

234
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,079
Am I early?
-No, right on the dot. Come on in.

235
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:22,759
Give me your hat.

236
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:26,838
Hey, you do alright for yourself.
-It's not bad, huh?

237
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,856
I don't blame you for likin' your job.
I haven't see a place like this since I was a kid.

238
00:30:30,857 --> 00:30:32,518
Good evening!

239
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,860
Alec, this is my daughter, Caroline.
Honey, this is Alec Longmire.

240
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,579
Hello!
-How do you do?

241
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,518
Well, I didn't expect this.
I had you down for an old bachelor.

242
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,997
Oh no, not me!

243
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:47,037
Dad tells me you may come to work for him.

244
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,259
Well, it's his idea.
What do you think about it?

245
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,638
Hm, deputies come and go.
-Hey now, you're a big help.

246
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,658
I've seen a lot of them.
Ready for supper?

247
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,716
I uh, really made an impression on her.
Didn't I?

248
00:31:01,717 --> 00:31:06,857
She's a little touchy about gunfighters.
Oh no,I don't think you'll need those to eat with. Come on.

249
00:31:12,757 --> 00:31:14,416
Thanks.

250
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:17,115
Well, there's nothing like home cooking
and this is the best.

251
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,595
Thank you.

252
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:20,954
No more for me.
- Uh, can I help you with anything?

253
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,234
No, I can manage.

254
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:24,394
I wipe dishes like no one you ever saw.

255
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:27,696
You're as handy with a towel
as you are with a gun huh?

256
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:32,433
Like a cigar??
-No, no thanks.

257
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,975
Excuse me, I'll get my pipe.

258
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:49,213
You uh, used your company dishes tonight, Didn't you?

259
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:52,773
Dad wants to impress you
with the virtues of home life.

260
00:31:53,073 --> 00:31:55,693
I'm considered an added attraction.

261
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:59,692
I'm afraid I haven't done very well.
-Well, you about half scared me off.

262
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:01,751
Whats the matter?
Have I have two heads?

263
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:04,013
No, two guns.

264
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:07,311
So do half the men in town.

265
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:09,790
They don't use them as well as you do.

266
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:13,070
Look, I uh, came here looking
for a job with cattle.

267
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:16,869
Jade is trying to change my mind.
See, what I'm really out for is a place of my own.

268
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,190
I've heard that same speech from
every gunslinger who's come to town.

269
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:22,230
They don't last.
- Why not?

270
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,710
They pin on a star,
make a few sheriff like motions...

271
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,469
then sell their guns to Henshaw.

272
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,509
Man takes a job, he should stick with it.

273
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,171
And how do you know I won't?
If I take the job, I mean.

274
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:35,628
Because it a regular pattern.
You all perk up when you see a young girl.

275
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:39,148
Make a speech about home cooking
give me a fast whirl about how nice I look.

276
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:41,629
I haven't said that.
-But you'll get to it.

277
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,929
-Maybe some of it's your fault.
- Mine?

278
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:49,809
You look at gunslingers like they're
all peas outta the same pod.

279
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,947
It's time you realize that they're
as different as anyone else.

280
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:55,168
As different as people'll let 'em be.

281
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:58,346
Sure there some gunslingers
who are half crazy and like to kill...

282
00:32:58,347 --> 00:33:01,107
but on the other hand, there are those that uh...

283
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:03,367
got a reputation they can't get away from.

284
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:08,888
Then there are those who'd like to settle
down, but the very people who should
be on their side won't give them a chance.

285
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,606
You mean me?
- Yes.

286
00:33:11,986 --> 00:33:15,065
I didn't ask Jade for a job.
I do not want that kind.

287
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:18,446
But he need what I've got.
What do you want me to do, turn him down?

288
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:22,184
How do I know you'll stay with him?

289
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:24,125
Well, would you stay with us?

290
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,246
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:31,423
I figure if a man wants to get away
from guns, he should get away from them.

292
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:35,024
The way I look at is, we each gotta
use ourselves the best we can.

293
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:38,485
Now, you wouldn't say a man was outside
the law because he draw pictures, would you?

294
00:33:38,704 --> 00:33:43,044
Well, the same man who draws pictures,
can use an engraving plate 'n counterfeit money.

295
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:46,703
You can use your gun to stick up a
bank or to keep peace and order.

296
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:48,782
It's the same gun, same bullets...

297
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:51,203
same hand pullin' the trigger.

298
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:53,883
Alright.

299
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:56,923
You just got yourself a new boy Sheriff.

300
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:05,522
If my brother Mike could see this,
he'd roll over in his grave.

301
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,179
What's on your mind, Bert?

302
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,019
A man can take just so much. There maybe
2 or 3 hundred miles of fence in those wagons.

303
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,799
If it were up to me, it would
be at the bottom of the river.

304
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:38,640
Now you're talking, Sam...

305
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:41,939
Listen, there's just the drivers
left with those wagons...

306
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,457
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- What are we waiting for?

307
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,318
How about Jade?
-I took care of him.

308
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,279
Come on.

309
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:48,473
- Who's there?
-Alec Longmire. Is Jade here?

310
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:50,233
Just a minute.

311
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:53,732
Sorry if I woke ya.
-That's alright.

312
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,211
- Where's Jade?
He rode out to the D-Cross.

313
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:59,331
Bert Flynn's boy stopped by. Said
Bert wanted to see him, it was important.

314
00:35:59,332 --> 00:36:02,051
Hm-m, so that's what they meant.
- Who?

315
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:05,530
This Bert. Tall, rangy fellow
looks like he's, uh, ready to a boil?

316
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:06,771
Why, yes. How did you know?

317
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:11,051
The other fellow's about the same height,
same build. Has a big mustache, called Sam.

318
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:12,530
That's Sam Baldwin.

319
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:16,049
They're gonna jump Henshaw's wagons
tonight and tricked Jade outta town.

320
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,871
What're you gonna do?
-What I'm hired to do.

321
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,108
Stay where you are, mister.

322
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,687
Somethin' on your mind?

323
00:36:46,688 --> 00:36:49,887
You know Bert Flynn and Sam Baldwin?
- What about 'em?

324
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:52,188
There might be trouble.
- Who are you?

325
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:54,988
Longmire, Murphy's new deputy.

326
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,847
Didn't know he had one.

327
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:59,628
How many guards you got?
-What's it to you?

328
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:04,126
I told you, there might be trouble.
-There’s a couple more at the Llano.

329
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:06,907
Better get 'em.
- Can't leave the wagons.

330
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:11,787
Alright, I'll get 'em, but don't go to sleep here,
they're liable to jump you any minute.

331
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:20,225
Burt! Sam!
Give it up!

332
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:40,024
I said, give it up!

333
00:37:49,364 --> 00:37:51,423
Man, that shootin'!

334
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:55,503
Alright, break it up!

335
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:00,841
We pegged ya wrong mister.
Thanks for the tip.

336
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:03,183
It's alright.
I'd do the same for them.

337
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:16,720
We're headed for a showdown
and I think it's about time.

338
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:19,919
Henshaw strings that wire,
I'll be cut off from grass.

339
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,421
You're Right.

340
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,780
What'll it be, Deputy?
-Nothing.

341
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,879
I see Jade got himself a new boy.

342
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,518
Yeah, where is Jade?

343
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,159
Not like 'im to be away at a time like this.

344
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,820
Wonder how long before this joker sells out?

345
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,139
Well now, maybe he's waiting for an offer.

346
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,938
Keep talkin' boys.
I'm a good listener.

347
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,898
Deputy!

348
00:38:58,278 --> 00:38:59,977
Hey, you!

349
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,276
You stand with Henshaw?
- No, Murphy.

350
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,856
Then get over to his office, put your
 feet on the desk, let things alone

351
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:11,636
Murphy wouldn't do that.

352
00:39:11,637 --> 00:39:15,116
You keep stickin' your nose
in, you won't be around long.

353
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:17,616
Do not say you weren't warned.

354
00:39:18,196 --> 00:39:19,514
You threatening me?

355
00:39:19,515 --> 00:39:22,016
We ain't invitin' ya to tea.

356
00:39:26,756 --> 00:39:30,335
I'm takin' Sam to jail, Bert.
You want the same thing or you goin' home?

357
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:33,695
You talk like a big man mister
- Make up your mind!

358
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:36,934
Well?

359
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:41,593
You better square yourself with Jade.

360
00:39:41,594 --> 00:39:43,833
Let's not have any trouble, Sam.

361
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:46,973
Excuse us, gentlemen.
We're comin' through.

362
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:52,753
You just walk and everything will be alright.

363
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:55,932
Enjoy yourself while you can mister.
It won't be for long.

364
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,276
I'm not having any more fun than you are Sam.

365
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,116
Lamp's on the desk, Sam.
Light it.

366
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:18,955
Keep your back to me, take off
your gun belt and hand it over.

367
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:28,035
Go through that door to the jail.

368
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,074
Go on!

369
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:36,955
First one's good enough.

370
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:47,794
See ya in the morning, Sam.
-You're gonna see a lot of me!

371
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:57,092
Well, good evening again.
I heard the shooting.

372
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:58,892
I had a little run in with Sam Baldwin.

373
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:00,633
Do you shoot him?

374
00:41:00,693 --> 00:41:02,052
No.

375
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:04,993
I wanted to see how it felt to arrest a man.

376
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:07,432
And how does it feel?

377
00:41:09,172 --> 00:41:11,472
Real strange.

378
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:15,072
First time a man ever threw
down on me I didn't call 'im.

379
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:20,010
You know, I think that Henshaw,
deliberately left those wagons there.

380
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,592
He's tricky enough to do it.
- Yeah.

381
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:26,890
I'd feel a lot better if you stayed at
home, 'til this simmered down. Alright?

382
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:28,551
Alright.

383
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:41,850
You've shown hand now.
The whole town will be watching you.

384
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:43,850
You mean Henshaw?
- That's right.

385
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:47,270
He'll look you up the first thing in the morning.
- Be glad to see 'im.

386
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,169
Henshaw believes every man has his price.

387
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,111
He's Right!

388
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:55,350
Oh, and what's your price Mister Longmire?

389
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,129
Well, if he buys to cheap, he won't appreciate it.

390
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:02,950
And, if I come too high, he'll try and
get rid of me as fast as he safely can

391
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,349
It's something I have to think about.
- I'm sure you'll give it your best thoughts.

392
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:21,867
Deputy.

393
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:26,287
- May I talk with you a moment?
- Sure.

394
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:28,668
My name is Rufus Henshaw.

395
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:31,387
I want to thank you for
warning my men.

396
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:34,947
Where were you when Bert and Sam
tried to grab your wagons tonight?

397
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:37,588
Is that important?
-It is to me.

398
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:41,326
You really think it concerns you?
I was breaking no law.

399
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:43,326
You were by the river, waiting...

400
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,787
They'd have stepped into a
sweet little ambush, wouldn't they?

401
00:42:46,446 --> 00:42:48,766
That's an assumption I don't like.

402
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,765
You accusing me
of bating a trap.

403
00:42:50,766 --> 00:42:52,346
Yes, sir.

404
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:58,027
I like that:'' Yes sir''.

405
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,485
I like a man who speaks his mind.

406
00:43:00,486 --> 00:43:03,444
That's fine, but you still haven't answered my question.

407
00:43:03,445 --> 00:43:05,586
What was it, Deputy?

408
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:08,105
You were by the river, waiting.
Weren't you?

409
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:14,226
You are young man Longmire, new to
your job. I was hoping we could be friends.

410
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:18,985
Let me walk you to the hotel.

411
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:23,044
I admire a man like you,
a man who knows his duty.

412
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:25,884
Willing to risk his life to keep the peace.

413
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:29,024
After all, there's nothing
I want more than peace.

414
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:32,264
You got a mighty peculiar way
of showing it, Mr. Henshaw.

415
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,884
Got a sense of humor too.

416
00:43:34,885 --> 00:43:38,083
Yes sir, there's no more
thankless job than a peace officer.

417
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:42,024
No one likes you.
Everyone's convinced
you're the other fellow's man.

418
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:44,423
Um huh, what do you think?

419
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:51,683
I've got big holdings Mr. Longmire
and they're going to get a lot bigger.

420
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:54,542
I need men around me that I can trust.

421
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:58,142
And I pay very well
to ensure their loyalty.

422
00:43:58,763 --> 00:44:00,703
I wonder...

423
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:03,462
I wonder if you'd be interested?

424
00:44:04,122 --> 00:44:06,942
How much?
- You'll name it.

425
00:44:07,962 --> 00:44:10,201
Well, I'll tell ya Mr. Henshaw...

426
00:44:10,202 --> 00:44:13,901
Soon as things settle down and Murphy
can spare me, I'll talk to you about it. Okay?

427
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:18,261
In the meantime, harness up
and get your wagons out of town.

428
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:22,520
I'm not very good at taking orders, Deputy.

429
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:25,120
Long as your wagons are in
town, we're liable to have trouble.

430
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,941
Get'em outta here.

431
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,740
A hot gun doesn't make a
soft pillow at night. Mr, Henshaw.

432
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:41,199
How right you are.
Give me half an hour.

433
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,340
You got it.
Thanks!

434
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,701
Evening gents.

435
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,519
Ruf, I see you've uh, you've
already met our new deputy.

436
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,758
How's everything?
-Couldn't be better.

437
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:56,780
I was just saying good night to Mr. Henshaw.
See you in the mornin', Jade.

438
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,859
Goodnight, Jade.

439
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:04,259
Bart! Palaski! Harness up, we're rolling

440
00:45:27,638 --> 00:45:29,156
Morning, Alec.

441
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:31,677
Morning. Coffee?
-Uh no, Thanks.

442
00:45:31,678 --> 00:45:35,316
-I hear you had yourself quite a time
last night, huh? - Oh, it wasn't to bad.

443
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:38,897
I just turned Sam Baldwin loose.
He's almost calmed down.

444
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:42,276
Yes sir, you came mighty close
to being a one day deputy..

445
00:45:42,277 --> 00:45:43,915
Yeah. What's up?

446
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:49,097
If I were to tell you that uh, Henshaw has hired
the best gunslinger  in the whole Southwest...

447
00:45:49,117 --> 00:45:50,936
What would you say?

448
00:45:51,276 --> 00:45:52,756
Chet Swann?

449
00:45:52,757 --> 00:45:55,376
Nobody but.
How good is he?

450
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:59,475
There's nothing good about 'im.
He's a kid, but he's all killer..

451
00:45:59,476 --> 00:46:02,535
Fast huh?
- The fastest. He's quick up here.

452
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:07,455
Uh huh, let's uh, stop in on brother
Henshaw and have a little talk.

453
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:15,153
If he's hired Swann, that's
a fact you can't argue about.

454
00:46:15,154 --> 00:46:16,554
Well, I've got to try.

455
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:19,655
The thing to do is to stop Swann.
- Yeah well, how do you do that?

456
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:22,634
There's no price on his head,
but why there isn't I'll never know.

457
00:46:22,635 --> 00:46:27,174
I know. Swann never draws first.
He doesn't have to.

458
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:47,753
This spread of Henshaw's looks
bigger than the whole state of Missouri.

459
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:50,712
You know, my father used to say
there's only three ways to get rich.

460
00:46:50,713 --> 00:46:54,213
Having someone leave it to
you, work for it and to steal it.

461
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,952
What I hear, Henshaw's used all three of 'em.

462
00:46:56,953 --> 00:46:59,391
Yeah, he's a man who
looks to the future alright.

463
00:46:59,392 --> 00:47:02,271
He, he says once the ranch is
secure he's going back East...

464
00:47:02,272 --> 00:47:05,652
To find himself a high-classed
Boston woman and live like a king.

465
00:47:05,672 --> 00:47:08,092
This is the part I like.

466
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:48,429
You'd better let me do the talking.
You prod 'im and he may get his back up.

467
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,330
He's your baby.
I just came along for the ride.

468
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:56,569
Hello Maria. - So good to see you again...
Thank you, thank you. Maria, shake hands with my new... Alec! Maria.

469
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:00,108
You two know each other?
-Maria and I are old friends.

470
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:02,628
- Why did you come here Alec?
- What's the matter?

471
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,228
You must not stay Alec.
- That you, Sheriff?

472
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:07,528
Yes, Ruf.

473
00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:11,768
Alec, there is much danger here.
- What are you doing out there, Maria?

474
00:48:11,948 --> 00:48:14,688
Alec, be careful. Please!

475
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:22,907
Nice to see you, Jade.

476
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:24,106
Sit down.

477
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:28,407
Maria, the Sheriff may want a drink.
-No! No thank you maria, a little to early for that.

478
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:33,807
I remembered.  You  like 'em mild.
-You never forget anything, do you?

479
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:36,927
Ruf, there are a couple of things
that have cone up that uh...

480
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:41,006
I think we outta talk about.
- Huh, go ahead, talk.

481
00:48:43,307 --> 00:48:46,927
Word's come to me that uh,
you've hired Chet Swann.

482
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:49,366
Chet Swann?
Who's he?

483
00:48:49,746 --> 00:48:51,726
You know who he is.

484
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:56,662
'Yes, I do.
- Hiring a gunman's not the answer.

485
00:48:57,442 --> 00:49:01,224
Violence is a last resort.
I'd like avoid it.

486
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:05,566
I lost 20 calves last month.

487
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:10,669
A week ago, twenty new calves turned up at Sam
Baldwin's with fresh Four Diamonds brands on them.

488
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:14,850
Two weeks ago, Bert Flynn turned
his herd into my North section.

489
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:18,212
Just yesterday somebody fouled
my waterhole in the West quarter.

490
00:49:18,213 --> 00:49:22,975
Ruf, I don't blame you for gettin' sore.
For my part, I've done what I could to stop it...

491
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:27,158
and I'll continue to do so, but hiring
a killer is not going to solve anything.

492
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,480
Jade, I been thinking about you.

493
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,420
You been working hard
here for 5 or 6 years.

494
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:38,143
Occurred to me you might want a vacation.
Ever been to New Orleans?

495
00:49:38,144 --> 00:49:39,263
No.

496
00:49:39,264 --> 00:49:42,424
Well, why you and Caroline
take the trip as my guests?

497
00:49:42,425 --> 00:49:44,346
Do ya a world of good.

498
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:46,146
A little obvious, aren't you?

499
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:49,890
Then, when I came back, you would have
everything here under control. Wouldn't ya?

500
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,411
Things might work themselves out.

501
00:49:52,431 --> 00:49:55,031
But I've waited a year for the
court to hand down its decision.

502
00:49:55,032 --> 00:49:56,773
I know you have.

503
00:49:57,553 --> 00:50:02,496
I'm going back East as soon as things straighten out.
I'll need someone to run Triple X.

504
00:50:02,756 --> 00:50:06,637
Not a bad job.
The ranch is growing.

505
00:50:06,638 --> 00:50:09,079
One of these days,
I'm gonna try purebred.

506
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,480
'It's a great opportunity.
-I'm sure of that Ruf, but...

507
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:13,361
I'll pay you double what you're getting now.

508
00:50:13,362 --> 00:50:15,343
And, a share of the profits.

509
00:50:15,723 --> 00:50:18,905
Let's face it Jade, you're
not getting any younger.

510
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:21,625
You're so right about that, but...

511
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:25,528
When folks elected me to office,
they figured I'd stay on the job.

512
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:27,389
That's up to you, Jade.

513
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:34,073
Think about it and 'do' something.
I don't want my hand forced.

514
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,453
Henshaw told me what happened last night

515
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:42,437
You'd better leave Durango,
because if you stay here I sure...
Maria!

516
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:46,898
Hello, Mr. Henshaw.

517
00:50:46,899 --> 00:50:48,920
Get into the house.

518
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:52,122
Maria's an old friend of mine.

519
00:50:52,623 --> 00:50:54,203
I see!

520
00:50:54,423 --> 00:50:57,124
But surely the gentleman
will excuse you, Maria.

521
00:50:58,745 --> 00:51:00,526
Please.

522
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,212
You must visit me again, Mr. Longmire.
It'll be a pleasure.

523
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:13,233
Think it over, Jade.

524
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:16,594
Not much to think about is there?.
Peace on your terms or else, huh?

525
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:18,595
Won't work.
- We'll see.

526
00:51:18,596 --> 00:51:20,217
Come on, Alec.

527
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:47,255
Lord, we thank you for the
blessings of this day, bless this...

528
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:52,896
You got enough stew for callers?
Not if you want seconds.

529
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:02,098
Afternoon!
- Come in, come in.

530
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:04,178
Thank you.

531
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:08,238
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb your meal.
- Quite alright, what can we do for you?

532
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,700
I was parched. I was wondering if I could...
- Of course. Just bring in your canteen.

533
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,440
Oh, that'd be to much trouble uh,
a cup full would be fine.

534
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:19,821
Well, go right over and help yourself.
Thanks.

535
00:52:24,162 --> 00:52:26,063
Thank you ma’am.

536
00:52:31,123 --> 00:52:34,283
Sam. I think you ought to
ask the gentleman to join us.

537
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,163
- Oh, sure. Here, I'll get another chair.
No, don't please.

538
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:39,825
Now, we don't have company very often.

539
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:41,844
No, since the children married

540
00:52:41,845 --> 00:52:43,706
Now, please sit down.

541
00:52:43,886 --> 00:52:45,786
There!

542
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:48,186
Our name is Baldwin.

543
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:52,246
You just passin' through?
No, sir.

544
00:52:52,247 --> 00:52:54,767
Oh! You're uh, lookin'
for a job in these parts?

545
00:52:54,768 --> 00:52:57,028
No, sir. I got a job.

546
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:02,229
This is delicious.
- Thank you.

547
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,169
See ya got nice linen.

548
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,409
Yes. isn't it. It's been
in our family a long time.

549
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:10,511
Who you workin' for?
- Man name of Henshaw.

550
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:14,871
As a cow puncher, of course.

551
00:53:15,171 --> 00:53:18,411
No, ma'am.
I got more talent than that.

552
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,513
Gunslinger!

553
00:53:21,213 --> 00:53:23,451
If I have to, I use my gun.

554
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:25,633
That's where my talent lies.

555
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:28,354
What does Henshaw want?

556
00:53:28,534 --> 00:53:32,034
Oh, he just asked me to drop over
and say goodbye to you nice people.

557
00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:38,516
We're not leaving.

558
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:48,398
Oh!. Stay as long as you like,

559
00:53:49,578 --> 00:53:51,998
24 hours at least.

560
00:53:52,218 --> 00:53:56,679
You know, I'm real sorry you gotta leave.
You such a fine cook.

561
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,520
Please, stop it!

562
00:54:14,742 --> 00:54:17,682
It's nice, real nice.

563
00:54:37,866 --> 00:54:41,247
Goodbye, Mrs. Baldwin.
Thanks you for a wonderful dinner.

564
00:54:42,588 --> 00:54:46,208
Goodbye, Mr. Baldwin.
It's been a pleasure.

565
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:53,530
Oh, I forgot to introduce myself, didn't I?

566
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:56,570
My name is Swann.

567
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,090
Chet Swann.

568
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:17,313
Jade!

569
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,994
It's that Chet Swan. He...

570
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:21,913
Get your breath, Sam.
What about him?

571
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:25,815
He came to see me.
He's given me 24 hours to clear out.

572
00:55:26,115 --> 00:55:29,656
If you can't handle him,
Bert and I know what to do.

573
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:31,355
Well?

574
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:34,217
Where's he now?
- Comin' here, I guess.

575
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,579
No one is runnin' anyone out.

576
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,820
Go on home now Sam
and forget about it.

577
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,900
The rest of you fellows,
clear outta here.

578
00:55:55,401 --> 00:55:57,141
Dad!

579
00:56:27,286 --> 00:56:29,006
Alec!

580
00:56:29,007 --> 00:56:31,427
Maria, what are you doing here?

581
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:36,188
Where've you been? I've been
waiting for you for a very long time.

582
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:38,728
Swann's coming, to kill you and Jade.

583
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,448
Why you tellin' me this?

584
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:44,030
We're old friends.
I can not forget the old days.

585
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,209
The old days are over Maria.

586
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:49,850
You don't trust me. You think
maybe it's a trick, don't you?

587
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:53,672
Believe me, this is no trick.
I've had enough.

588
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:56,491
Henshaw?
Yes.

589
00:56:56,492 --> 00:56:59,372
Never were lucky with men were you.
- Isn't it always this way.

590
00:56:59,373 --> 00:57:02,292
But please, don't let trouble find you.

591
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:06,674
You thinkin' of stayin' town?
-Only until morning. Then I will take the stagecoach.

592
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:09,234
Come with me Alec, please!

593
00:57:09,735 --> 00:57:11,715
Please come with me.

594
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,414
It's no good, Maria.

595
00:57:13,415 --> 00:57:15,995
What will you do?
Stay here and die in the dust?

596
00:57:22,296 --> 00:57:24,637
Alec, I... I'm sorry. I...
- What is it?

597
00:57:24,937 --> 00:57:28,078
Swann's on his way into town.
Jade needs you.

598
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,558
If you can spare the time?
- I'll be right there.

599
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,400
Your girl, she did
not like what she saw.

600
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,179
It's not my girl.

601
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,961
If she was not your girl, she
would not have minded that I am here.

602
00:57:47,742 --> 00:57:50,522
It's all I've got Maria.
Good luck.

603
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:05,184
You gonna shoot it out with Swann?
- Not if I can help it.

604
00:58:05,185 --> 00:58:06,824
How you gonna help it?

605
00:58:06,825 --> 00:58:10,045
Why don't you boys go home
until things calm down, huh?

606
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:15,567
Go home? Ha!
- Boy, the sun shines today!

607
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:24,248
Morning, Alec.

608
00:58:24,909 --> 00:58:28,027
Thought you'd be loading
your shotgun by now.

609
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:30,188
Why would I load a shotgun for?

610
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:34,530
If I were Sheriff and Swann was on the prowl
for me, I'd be up on the roof with a shotgun.

611
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,949
Sometimes you don't make good sense, son.

612
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,611
There's nothing in the rules says the
sheriff has to be a hero, just keep the peace.

613
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:45,150
If I was the sheriff and I wanted to keep the peace,
I'd go up on the roof and let him have it the legs..

614
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:47,271
But you'd rather take him prisoner, wouldn't ya?

615
00:58:47,272 --> 00:58:51,672
If I was to use a shotgun, I wouldn't have a friend in
town. I'd be worse than stabbing a man in the back

616
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:53,493
You would if your life depended on it.

617
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:57,294
Jade, you will not like
what I'm gonna say to you.

618
00:58:58,074 --> 00:59:01,015
You try and shoot it out
with Swann, you're dead.

619
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:04,354
You get old fast with a gun.

620
00:59:04,355 --> 00:59:06,155
Day comes when you slow down.

621
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:08,875
When all your skill 'n
experience doesn't mean a thing.

622
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:12,706
And if you're smart, you
know what'll happen if you miss.

623
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:16,016
Because if you're old, you'll
value what's left of your life.

624
00:59:16,076 --> 00:59:19,977
A kid like Swann doesn't know what
it is to be afraid. I've seen him work.

625
00:59:20,358 --> 00:59:22,636
He'll gun you down
before you clear the holster.

626
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:26,458
You haven't got a prayer.
I'm tellin' you like I'd tell my own father.

627
00:59:26,638 --> 00:59:29,699
I wouldn't be able to hold my
head up if I used a shotgun.

628
00:59:30,439 --> 00:59:33,619
Well, alright.
Be a hero.

629
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,439
Shoot it out with 'im. See if it
makes any difference to me.

630
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,039
Go ahead, and put on a show for a bunch
of gutless fools who take cover when it starts.

631
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,080
Give the drunks somethin'
to talk about in the winter.

632
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:43,840
Present the town with
a first-class funeral.

633
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:46,201
Maybe your good friend
Henshaw will deliver the eulogy.

634
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:48,271
 Will you stop it.
- Make your play.

635
00:59:48,272 --> 00:59:51,672
Don't think about Caroline.
-I've thought of her, and you.

636
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:53,613
I thought of everything.

637
00:59:53,753 --> 00:59:57,592
There are ways to do
things and that's not one of 'em.

638
00:59:57,593 --> 00:59:59,313
Alright.

639
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:01,174
Alright!

640
01:00:11,957 --> 01:00:13,737
He's here.

641
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:29,540
That's Swann, I betcha.

642
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,522
Oh, Dad!
-Caroline, you shouldn't have come back here.

643
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,283
Oh, Dad, please.
- I'll be alright.

644
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:50,963
No you won't. You know you won't!
You haven't a chance.

645
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:54,203
Let me go, dear.
- Alright, Jade. I'll take him on.

646
01:00:54,204 --> 01:00:56,884
You want folks to think I was yellow
and siced you on 'im?  No, thanks.

647
01:00:56,885 --> 01:00:58,764
I'm telling you you can't go out there.

648
01:00:58,765 --> 01:01:02,225
Look son, no one to tell me
what I can't do, not even you.

649
01:01:05,526 --> 01:01:07,627
He'll be alright.

650
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:23,109
You gonna use a shotgun?
- You couldn't miss nothing with that.

651
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,790
I do not intend to miss.

652
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:30,791
I'd crawl before I'd use a shotgun.
- Get inside. Both of you. Go on!.

653
01:01:36,132 --> 01:01:38,113
Chet Swann!

654
01:01:50,214 --> 01:01:52,315
Get outta town.

655
01:01:52,495 --> 01:01:54,895
Well, Alec Longmire!

656
01:01:54,896 --> 01:01:58,095
I almost didn't recognize you
with that cannon in your hands!

657
01:01:58,096 --> 01:02:00,495
Mount up, before I blast
ya all over the street.

658
01:02:00,496 --> 01:02:03,296
Aw... ain't near as friendly as he used to be.

659
01:02:03,297 --> 01:02:06,056
Aren't you even gonna let me
buy you a little drink for old times?

660
01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:08,438
You're wasting your
time. Now, get goin'.

661
01:02:08,498 --> 01:02:12,319
You know, I wouldn't
have believed it. A tin star!

662
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:15,679
A tin star on Alec Longmire.

663
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,240
Get goin'!

664
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,680
Alright.

665
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,160
I guess you ain't the
Alec I used to know.

666
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,484
So long, Alec.

667
01:02:43,544 --> 01:02:45,725
I'll see you around.

668
01:03:02,227 --> 01:03:03,827
Go on home.
The show's over.

669
01:03:03,828 --> 01:03:06,769
What show?
Come on, Chuck.

670
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:16,149
- Want your star back?
No, Alec, you can keep it.

671
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,270
I was wrong, dead wrong

672
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,691
Isn't over. Henshaw
hasn't stopped yet.

673
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,731
He'll try somethin'.

674
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:25,612
Come on. I'll buy ya
a drink. You need it.

675
01:03:47,076 --> 01:03:48,976
Drop it, Alec.

676
01:03:56,437 --> 01:03:59,538
It's a nice chair ya got
here. Real comfortable.

677
01:04:00,158 --> 01:04:03,958
I thought I told you to get out of town.
-That was your cannon talkin'.

678
01:04:03,959 --> 01:04:06,539
I should've let you
have it with, both barrels.

679
01:04:07,479 --> 01:04:11,261
Now what a way to talk to a
guest, an old friend at that.

680
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:14,440
You can save the auld lang syne.
We never were friends.

681
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:16,101
Weren't we?

682
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:18,241
I got a job, Alec.

683
01:04:18,242 --> 01:04:20,001
Well, don't tell me
about it. I'm not interested.

684
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:22,202
You mean you're
not interested in living?

685
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:24,561
Must be kinda dull,
being a lawman
.

686
01:04:24,562 --> 01:04:27,442
Yes, especially when
I have to listen to you.

687
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:31,564
Be social. You're makin' me sorry I didn't
squeeze the trigger when you came through the door.
.

688
01:04:31,565 --> 01:04:34,824
What stopped you?
I do not know.

689
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:37,545
Call it friendship.

690
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:41,805
I hate to repeat myself, but I don't
like any part of you and I never did.

691
01:04:41,806 --> 01:04:45,026
You can't change by
pinnin' a tin star on your shirt.

692
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:48,708
You and me,
were two of a kind.

693
01:04:49,488 --> 01:04:53,108
If that's so, you better put that
six shooter to work right now.

694
01:04:54,848 --> 01:04:56,728
You know, I don't get you.

695
01:04:56,729 --> 01:05:00,009
Here I keep tellin' myself, there's
no sense doin' in a fellow gunfighter...

696
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,449
especially since I already
been paid for the job.

697
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:05,190
And here you are, askin'
me for a ticket to Boot Hill.

698
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,450
Alec, get smart.
Move on with me.

699
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:10,050
I'm not going anywhere yet.

700
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:11,890
This is a nice town with nice people.

701
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:13,211
This bunch of fat bellies?

702
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:16,292
I happen to like it enough
to stick around for a while.

703
01:05:16,293 --> 01:05:19,192
You think they'll forget,
what you were?

704
01:05:19,212 --> 01:05:21,772
Why should they?
I won't.

705
01:05:21,773 --> 01:05:24,213
You know, I don't know what
you got against gunfighters.

706
01:05:24,214 --> 01:05:26,974
You gotta have gunfighters,
wouldn't be right not to

707
01:05:26,975 --> 01:05:30,755
Be like not havin' rattlers in the desert.
Now, doesn't that make real sense?

708
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:36,316
Get up.

709
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:41,837
That's a nice soft bed you got there.

710
01:05:42,937 --> 01:05:45,718
But you better not be
sleeping on it from here on.

711
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:56,870
Just in case any of you can't
read or have poor eyesight...

712
01:06:56,871 --> 01:06:59,231
I'll read the notice to you.

713
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:01,710
Triple X will fence tomorrow.

714
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:04,692
Interference will be met with gunfire.

715
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:14,574
Is that a legal notice you're posting, Mr. Henshaw?
You can take it anyway you like.

716
01:07:14,874 --> 01:07:18,094
We don't like it 'n we're not gonna take it.
- Exactly my sentiments.

717
01:07:18,794 --> 01:07:22,055
We'll be waiting for you.
- He's got that wrong, hadn't he?.

718
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:24,435
What Mr. Henshaw means
is, we'll be waiting on him...

719
01:07:24,436 --> 01:07:26,956
while he cools off in our comfortable jail.

720
01:07:26,957 --> 01:07:28,875
Open your eyes.

721
01:07:28,876 --> 01:07:31,937
Those are rifle barrels
breathing down your neck.

722
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:38,378
Take your blinders off
Henshaw and look around.

723
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,581
Alright, get their guns. All of 'em.

724
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:55,280
I think you'll find our jail a
little more peaceful, Mr. Henshaw.

725
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:58,481
What is the charge?
- Disturbing the peace. Least that'll do for a start.

726
01:07:58,482 --> 01:08:00,882
In that case, neither of you
will be around for the finish.

727
01:08:00,883 --> 01:08:02,642
Why don't you stop talking so big?

728
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:04,823
Let him talk.
Go ahead and talk.

729
01:08:05,963 --> 01:08:08,304
- He'll be back.
- Swann?

730
01:08:08,844 --> 01:08:11,324
And this time he'll put
a bullet in your back

731
01:08:11,325 --> 01:08:15,345
You  rat. You're the
kind that breeds gunslingers.

732
01:08:15,485 --> 01:08:19,125
Never dirty your own hands,
never fight your own battles,
never stick your own neck out.

733
01:08:19,126 --> 01:08:22,346
I fight fire with fire,
gunslinger with gunslinger.

734
01:09:44,182 --> 01:09:47,082
Now, let's lock 'im up.

735
01:09:57,264 --> 01:10:00,245
Ruf... Here's your drink of water.

736
01:10:00,985 --> 01:10:03,143
Anything else you'd like?

737
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:05,864
Yes, a seat by the window...

738
01:10:05,865 --> 01:10:09,086
So I can watch you
and Longmire get yours.

739
01:10:47,473 --> 01:10:49,153
That's not Swann.

740
01:10:58,035 --> 01:11:00,234
What's going on here?
- Stick around.

741
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:03,376
Your liable to see something you
can tell your grandchildren about.
- Yeah? Yep.

742
01:11:08,437 --> 01:11:10,217
Alec.

743
01:11:10,317 --> 01:11:13,978
You better get inside somewhere.
-I have to talk to you.

744
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:15,958
This is hardly the place.

745
01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:18,618
Please Alec.
I want to apologize.

746
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:22,500
I'm sorry for believing
you couldn't change.

747
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,140
Sorry for thinking what I thought
when I saw you with that girl.

748
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,381
Did you talked to Maria?
- No.

749
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:32,622
She couldn't tell me
anything I don't know about you.

750
01:11:33,362 --> 01:11:36,142
What do you know?
- That I'm afraid for you.

751
01:11:36,602 --> 01:11:39,303
Oh Alec, must you wait for Swann.

752
01:11:39,803 --> 01:11:43,904
What do you want me to do, run away and hide?
- If it would keep you alive, yes.

753
01:11:43,964 --> 01:11:47,584
But I wanna stay alive.
So please Caroline, go away.

754
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:51,185
I gotta keep my eyes open and
my mind on nothin' else but Swann.

755
01:11:52,525 --> 01:11:55,105
Isn't there any another way?

756
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:00,747
I made a promise to a man before he died.

757
01:12:01,207 --> 01:12:04,467
I promised him I would quit livin' by the gun...

758
01:12:05,247 --> 01:12:07,927
And here I am, with
a gun still in hands

759
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:09,868
Then why stay?

760
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,768
Because I'm wearin' this badge.

761
01:12:13,769 --> 01:12:16,448
The only place I've got a
right to wear it, is in this town.

762
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:19,350
That's why I've got to wait
for Swann to show up again.

763
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:22,030
So please Caroline, go
inside somewhere. Will you?

764
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:25,271
Alec, I'm gonna get up a posse.

765
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:29,251
Swann'll smell a posse a mile away.
- Well, at least we'll scare off.

766
01:12:29,252 --> 01:12:31,971
Yeah, and I'll be livin'
scared, jumpin' at shadows.

767
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:33,892
Why don't you
let me do it my way?

768
01:12:33,893 --> 01:12:36,673
Come on, Caroline.
Come on, honey.

769
01:12:37,494 --> 01:12:40,673
Where's Jade going?
- Not far, I betcha .

770
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,459
Dad, I can take care of myself.

771
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:15,500
Now, do not argue about it. You're
gonna stay at Mrs. Blake's 'til it's over.

772
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:18,401
Are you going to get up a posse?
- I tried.

773
01:13:29,103 --> 01:13:31,123
Hold it Jade!

774
01:13:33,144 --> 01:13:35,684
Move this way.

775
01:13:38,104 --> 01:13:40,005
Both of you!

776
01:13:42,466 --> 01:13:44,645
Come on.

777
01:13:47,546 --> 01:13:48,887
Dad!

778
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,367
Oh Dad!
Let me go! Let me go!

779
01:13:57,228 --> 01:13:59,449
This ain't like us, Alec.

780
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:06,209
Splash the shotgun, and I'll
let the lady go about her business.

781
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,330
Then we can go about ours.

782
01:14:53,278 --> 01:14:55,819
One sound outta
you and it's your last.

783
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:00,299
Alec! Look out!

784
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:14,643
He got 'im!
- He did it! He did it!

785
01:15:42,568 --> 01:15:45,366
Hey Alec, you going away?
You leavin' town?

786
01:15:45,367 --> 01:15:47,807
I am.
- No! Why?

787
01:15:47,808 --> 01:15:51,189
Why Alec?
- You wouldn't understand man.

788
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:57,129
Morning, Alec.

789
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:59,530
Morning Jade. How you feelin'?
- Better, thank you.

790
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:03,271
Well uh, you
might be needin' this.

791
01:16:03,651 --> 01:16:06,091
I'm here to say goodbye.
- Where you going?

792
01:16:06,092 --> 01:16:09,593
Well, it's like Jade said, there's not
much in the way of jobs around here...

793
01:16:09,893 --> 01:16:12,811
might take the courts a year or more to
decide what they wanna do.

794
01:16:12,812 --> 01:16:14,833
You must have
something in mind Alec.

795
01:16:15,493 --> 01:16:18,253
My Dad used to say it's
wasn't enough for a man...

796
01:16:18,254 --> 01:16:20,954
to bring his wife his heart 'n his head.

797
01:16:21,174 --> 01:16:23,555
Had to offer offer her
the fruit of his hands.

798
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:26,716
The way things stand,
is not much to offer.

799
01:16:39,137 --> 01:16:41,758
See ya Jade. Take
care of yourself, hear.

800
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:46,239
I'll be back.

801
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:49,879
I'll be seein' you men.

802
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,041
Hey, where's your rifle today?
- We don't need it anymore.
