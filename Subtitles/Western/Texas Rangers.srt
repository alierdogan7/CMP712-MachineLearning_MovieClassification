1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,100
(two loud gunshots)

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,000
(men shouting and whooping)

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,100
(battlefield gunfire)

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,100
NARRATOR:
During the Civil War, the only
lawmen in Southern Texas...

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,600
the Texas Rangers... disbanded
to fight for the Confederacy.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,800
Ranger Captain Leander McNelly
was also the local preacher.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,100
He left his family and ministry
to fight alongside his men.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,100
After the war, McNelly
returned to a defeated Texas

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,100
and found his wife
and three sons gone...

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,100
taken by bandits.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,600
In the ten years
since the war's end

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
bandits have overrun
southern Texas.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,200
Now, the governor
is looking for McNelly.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,500
They say he wants to
recommission the Texas Rangers.

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,300
(thunder rumbling
in the distance)

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,400
(man coughs)

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,300
(grunting with effort)

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,500
(thunder rumbling)

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,200
(horse neighing)

20
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,500
(horse whinnies)

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,900
Leander...

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
you know,
that's a right pretty spot

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,500
for a resting place.

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,300
Who's the grave for?

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
The grave's for me.

26
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,300
Wait too long

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
ground'll be froze.

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,800
Leander, come spend the winter
at my ranch.

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,000
You rode down,
we'd have a place for you.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Be like old times.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
I don't reckon
I'll last the winter.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
Governor said
he sent some of his men.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,400
You wouldn't show at the door.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,500
Said maybe you'd answer for me.

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,500
The governor
just wants to talk with you.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,900
You don't got to say

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
yes or no
or it's a cold September.

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,300
All you got to do is see him,
Leander.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,400
(stagecoach rattling)

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Hyah! Hyah!

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,800
And never underestimate
the importance of the name

42
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,300
that you choose for a product.

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,400
"The Dunnison and Sons

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,200
"Automatic Drawer

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
for the Tabulation
of Financial Transactions."

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,900
That just about tells the story,
doesn't it?

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Every shopkeeper in the country
will want one

48
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,300
(chuckling)
- Before they even see it.

49
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,700
Well, that's good, because
the prototype doesn't work.

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,800
It's a prototype, son,
it's not supposed to work.

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,400
That's why they call it
a prototype.

52
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
Look at this.

53
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,400
I've already come up
with a solution

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
to the prob...

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,900
It's for your mother.

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Why didn't you mail it
while we were in Austin?

57
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,600
You'll see.

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
(men hollering and whistling)

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,900
(mooing)

60
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,000
Past 4:00, Marshall.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
We should get started

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,700
before these buyers
get even more nervous.

63
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,900
I got a bad feeling.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200
You just got to border
country today, Marshall.

65
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,300
You'll get used to it.

66
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,700
Coming down.

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,500
There you go.

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,600
Lincoln!

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mother? Jake?

70
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,100
Oh, thank goodness.

71
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,500
Oh...

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
(chuckling)

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,100
Look how tall you've gotten.

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,600
- Nice hat.
- Little brother.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
What? You're going
to be a lawyer?

76
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
- I just might.
- How beautiful.

77
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, you still quick?

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,300
Come on, boy.

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
(quiet laugh)

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,800
(clanging)

81
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,100
I'd like to thank

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,200
all of you for coming here today
for the first

83
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,700
of what we hope

84
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,900
will be many
cattle auctions

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
here in Las Coli...

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,900
King Fisher.

87
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
(horse neighs)

88
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,800
(slow hoofbeats)

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,600
What's your business here,
Fisher?

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,300
Come for my beeves.

91
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,700
This here's an auction.

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
You're welcome to bid
when the time comes.

93
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,800
I bid 50.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,100
50 what?

95
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,300
50 of them.

96
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,600
(hoofbeats thundering)

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,200
(horses neighing)

98
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,600
(horses whinny and burr)

99
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,200
(guns cocking)

100
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
FISHER:
Marshall, I don't
think you understand.

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,700
Around here,
I'm the law.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
Now, I'm taking
my beeves home.

103
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,500
I can't let you
take these cattle.

104
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,700
(shouting and screaming)

105
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,000
(gunfire)

106
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,600
(screaming continues)

107
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,900
(townsfolk clamoring)

108
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,300
(men speaking indistinctly
in Spanish)

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
(chuckling quietly)

110
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,300
(woman screams)

111
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,600
(men yelling indistinctly
in Spanish)

112
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,600
(gunshot)

113
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
(woman shrieks)

114
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,100
MAN:
All right, all of you,
fan out!

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Come on! Come on!

116
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,800
Hyah!

117
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,500
(whistling and shouting)

118
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Come on, let's
get out of here!

119
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,100
(crying quietly)

120
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,300
(insects chirring)

121
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,400
(bird keening)

122
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,000
(fire crackling)

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,100
(bird cawing)

124
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
(man groans)

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,300
(floor planks squeaking)

126
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Is anyone here?

127
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't move and I'll shoot!

128
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,500
Don't move and you'll shoot?

129
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,500
What does that mean?

130
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,600
If I don't move,
you're going to shoot me?

131
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

132
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,200
My name is
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

133
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,300
You understand, I'm not
one of the men who did this...

134
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,700
so I'll be on my way.

135
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,400
(whimpering softly)

136
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,500
I can't lift it free.

137
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,700
I can help you.

138
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,600
Put down the gun.

139
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,600
(hammer uncocks)

140
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm from Missouri.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We was on a cattle drive

142
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,700
and stopped for supplies,
and we got ambushed.

143
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,200
They stole all the cattle
and killed everybody.

144
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,700
Didn't kill you.

145
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,900
I was trapped...

146
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,100
and they didn't see me

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,700
and I'm damn lucky
that was the case

148
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,400
otherwise, I'd
be dead too.

149
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,600
So, where you headed?

150
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,800
Brownsville.

151
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,300
Brownsville?
What's there?

152
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,600
Texas Rangers
are recruiting.

153
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,300
Texas Rangers?!

154
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm going with you.

155
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,400
We'll get them bandits.

156
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,100
It's a long way
to Brownsville.

157
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,300
I got a horse.

158
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,800
Name's George Durham.

159
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,000
(coyote howls)

160
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,800
(bird hooting)

161
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Not so used

162
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
to sleeping under the stars,
are you?

163
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,600
(howling and barking)

164
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,500
Well...
there's nothing to it, really.

165
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,800
Just, uh, dig yourself
a little hip hole

166
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,100
and then you fill a bandanna

167
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
full of saw grass

168
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,000
and stick that
underneath your head.

169
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,000
It's the Lord's country,
Lincoln.

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah... Lord's country.

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,800
Land this beautiful...

172
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,100
ain't no wonder

173
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,200
everybody's
killing over her.

174
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,400
(coyote howling)

175
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,600
She's been here
a long time before us.

176
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
She'll be here

177
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,200
a long time to come.

178
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,800
You are a philosopher,
George Durham.

179
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,600
(horses whinnying)

180
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,800
DRIVER:
Hyah!

181
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,100
Brownsville.

182
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
MAN:
We're going
to protect

183
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,800
you people,
least you can do

184
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,200
is contribute supplies.

185
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,700
You want a starving army?

186
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,100
Who's going to keep
the crops safe then?

187
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,900
You fellas there

188
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,500
grab all the grub
you can carry.

189
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,800
Get your irons and fall in.

190
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,500
We're riding south
to kill bandits!

191
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,900
(townsfolk murmuring)

192
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,800
Afternoon, Rangers.

193
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,900
What's your business here?

194
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,300
By order of the community

195
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,400
I've got a vigilance committee
formed.

196
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,800
Nary a Yankee, nigger
or Mexican among us.

197
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,900
Unless you have
the authority of the state

198
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,400
disband and disarm these men.

199
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
They won't have it.

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,400
We aim to protect
our land.

201
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,200
Men who want to protect
their land

202
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,000
they can apply to hire from me.

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,900
Governor's commissioned
the Rangers

204
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,800
to do the
protecting, mister.

205
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,700
Now, you disband these men.

206
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,000
You from San Antone?

207
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,700
'Cause you
sure as hell

208
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,000
remind me
of this preacher there.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,500
It was some years ago...

210
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,400
some preacher man.

211
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,600
I don't recall no time
in San Antone.

212
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
No, I suppose you don't.

213
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,700
Men, you can keep your guns
to guard your homes

214
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
but that means
go home.

215
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,100
(crowd murmuring)

216
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,900
I'll give you one minute
to take a vote.

217
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
Hey, Preacher...

218
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,500
vote's in.

219
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,000
Preacher...

220
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,600
(gasping)

221
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,200
Say me last rites, Preacher

222
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
before he takes me.

223
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,300
I ain't no preacher.

224
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,800
Company's making camp,
two nights in Brownsville.

225
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,800
Any of you men interested
in taking on the star?

226
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,000
West end of town's
where you'll find us.

227
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,200
You look for me,
Leander McNelly

228
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,300
or my associates

229
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,400
Sergeant
John Armstrong

230
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,800
or Frank Bones.

231
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,100
(snarling)

232
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,600
DRIVER:
Hyah, hyah!

233
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,700
(wagon squeaking and rattling)

234
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,600
Whoa-whoa. Whoa.

235
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,800
Habla ingles?

236
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,100
Mexicano?

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,900
The big villas are north, yes?

238
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,500
You asking or telling?

239
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,000
That is what we want.

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,300
I thought the cattles,
you drive them north, too.

241
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,000
With many peoples.

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
With iron trains.

243
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
That is what we want.

244
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,700
These beeves
don't speak ingles.

245
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,900
They speak, uh...
Espanol.

246
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,200
(chuckling)

247
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,300
What do you want for her?

248
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,300
The tigre is not for sale,
senor.

249
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
What about her?

250
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,000
She is my wife, senor.

251
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,100
What's she do?

252
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,000
What's she do?!

253
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,700
She acrobat, senor.

254
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,100
She spins and balances
and juggles.

255
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,800
Well, if she can juggle
three balls in the air

256
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,300
without dropping one of them,
you can keep your tomcat.

257
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,900
(chuckles)

258
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Perdita, andele.

259
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Mas alto.

260
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,600
Mas alto, Perdita.

261
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
(screams)

262
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,800
Catch it!

263
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,000
Hyah!

264
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,800
(screams)

265
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,300
(gunshot)

266
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,400
(chuckles)

267
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
Name?

268
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,900
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.

269
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Where you from,
Mr. Dunnison?

270
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,300
From Philadelphia, sir, as a boy

271
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,000
but I spent the last three years
traveling with my father

272
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,100
a salesman and inventor.

273
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,300
Where's he now?

274
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,700
He's dead, sir.

275
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,600
He was shot down by bandits.

276
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
Ain't no revenge riding,
Mr. Dunnison.

277
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,100
Yes, sir.

278
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,500
Saddle up.

279
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,600
When Frank here says
draw, you draw.

280
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,900
Takes longer than
a half a second

281
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,100
means you're dead.

282
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
That Ranger badge
is your target.

283
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,200
Sarsaparilla.

284
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,400
Most boys draw on sarsaparilla.

285
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Draw, damn it.

286
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
The gun doesn't seem
to be loaded, sirs.

287
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,600
Son, you might want
to cock the hammer.

288
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,000
How'd he do?

289
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,400
Nine seconds.

290
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,900
Seen worse.

291
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,900
Gentlemen, you've been gracious
to grant me your time.

292
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
I wish you the best
in your endeavors.

293
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,000
Give my best to Philadelphia.

294
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Just so there are
no hard feelings either way

295
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,600
I didn't come here
for a month's pay

296
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,900
or to execute
some bandits

297
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,100
like they did
my family.

298
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,000
I came here
because you sent out for men

299
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,600
who wanted to protect
their land.

300
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,600
I have no land
but the patch

301
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,800
my own two feet stand on

302
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,200
but I would want that land
to be lawful, sir.

303
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,600
You put that down in writing,
Mr. Dunnison?

304
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,900
Sir?

305
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,400
That high-minded talk.

306
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
You write like that, too?

307
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,700
In English, French or Latin?

308
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,100
Well, shit, Mr. Dunnison.

309
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,700
I only know Spanish,
Cherokee and Comanche.

310
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,800
$40 a month in a state scrip
and found.

311
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,900
You'll get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

312
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,400
You'll get your orders
from me.

313
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
We'll sell you the boots,
sell you a gun

314
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,500
sell you a steed.

315
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,400
But it'll run you $40,
Mr. Dunnison

316
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,800
so you better last a month...

317
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,900
'cause you're in debt to me
already.

318
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,500
Here you are.

319
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,600
Thanks.

320
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,500
Wear it proud, son.

321
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,000
Sergeant.

322
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,300
(stuttering):
Name's Sam from
S-S-San Antone.

323
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,300
I never been
to S-S-San Antone.

324
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Randolph Douglas Scipio

325
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,600
from around
the Texarkana way.

326
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,200
My daddy staked
some land out there.

327
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
Turned out to find himself
a copper mine

328
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,000
so they killed my daddy.

329
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,200
You shouldn't be able
to just shoot a man

330
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,200
and claim his land.

331
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,400
Yeah.

332
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,600
Yeah, I aim to
change that.

333
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,100
So, uh, Sergeant say

334
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,800
whether he'll use you as
a rifleman or a scout?

335
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,400
A rifleman or a scout?

336
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,600
Well, every white
boy I met yet

337
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,300
says Sergeant
made him a rifleman.

338
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,300
Every colored, like me

339
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,100
Sergeant made a scout.

340
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,300
Well, every war
I ever heard of

341
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,000
scouts get killed
before the shooters

342
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
'cause they're the stupid son
of a bitches sent out front.

343
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
And if I don't meet
some white boy scouts soon

344
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,900
President Grant's
going to be hearing from me.

345
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,300
Sure.

346
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,500
A strongly worded letter's
always best.

347
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,200
They say I'm a scout?

348
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,500
You see this star here?

349
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm gonna show them
I'm a shooter.

350
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,400
Dunnison.

351
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,300
What do you think, huh?

352
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,400
(snorts)

353
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,300
George!

354
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Lincoln! Lincoln!

355
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Lincoln!

356
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
We're Rangers!

357
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,400
We made it!

358
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,300
(laughing)

359
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,100
We're not sleeping
under the stars.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,100
We got a tent.

361
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,500
Oh, it's nice, too.

362
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
You got to see it.

363
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
(laughing)

364
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,300
It's a tent!

365
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,600
I got my be...
I'm on the left!

366
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,800
BONES:
Fisher's been splitting

367
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,200
his men into several bands.

368
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,800
They've been
raiding ranches

369
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
all along this trail
on the way to Mexico.

370
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,300
GUARD:
Captain? Mr. Dunnison's
reporting, sir.

371
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,500
Send him in.

372
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,800
Captain.

373
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,400
Sergeant said
you wanted to see me.

374
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Thanks, Frank.

375
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,500
Take a seat, Mr. Dunnison.

376
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,700
Notebook and pen are yours.

377
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,100
Every word I say,
you write it down.

378
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,500
Something slips by,
slow me down.

379
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Understood, sir.

380
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,200
October 26.

381
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,000
Company now
fully outfitted

382
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,900
with 30 men,
orphans mostly.

383
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,400
Youngest 15.

384
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,700
We'll leave tomorrow
and train on the trail.

385
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,500
Fisher split his men
into smaller raiding parties.

386
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,100
Lord hope that we're
not attacked directly.

387
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,700
(McNelly coughing)

388
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,200
Scant trail
experience

389
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,700
weakness with weapons...

390
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,500
Expect desertions along the way.

391
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,900
Expect... expect most of
these boys will not survive.

392
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,200
(coughing)

393
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,400
Sir?

394
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,500
I'm capable
of writing

395
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,900
my reports to the government,
Mr. Dunnison.

396
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,900
But there will come a time
when I am not.

397
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,500
I'd rather have you
in the habit.

398
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,300
(coughing)

399
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,900
(gasping)

400
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,500
The Lord is coming for me,
Mr. Dunnison.

401
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,300
Sir, then why ride?

402
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,900
I figure it's better
I walk to meet Him...

403
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,400
...than sit and wait.

404
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,300
Hey.

405
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,800
What'd the captain want?

406
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,700
He's dying.

407
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,800
Our captain is dying.

408
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
Rangers!

409
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,000
Our mission is to stop

410
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,100
the outlaw John King Fisher.

411
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,700
Fisher and his men
have been burning ranches

412
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,300
thieving cattle and
driving them into Mexico

413
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,300
where he sells them
to the Mexican army.

414
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,500
More than a million
beeves stolen.

415
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,700
More than
400 men murdered.

416
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,100
We'll be patrolling
border country

417
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
to find these animals,
bring them to justice.

418
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,900
U.S. Cavalry's
got a mandate

419
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,900
to settle Indian matters.

420
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,400
Leaves us to protect
the Texan way.

421
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,000
It's our home, Rangers

422
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,400
and we got right
on our side.

423
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
Ain't no outlaw
stands a fighting chance!

424
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,600
(gunshots)

425
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,800
(cheering and whooping)

426
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,800
(crowd cheering)

427
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,400
(cheering continues)

428
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,500
(bridle clanking)

429
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,600
(horse burring)

430
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,000
Buck up, recruit!

431
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,800
This ain't no
goddamn pony ride.

432
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,300
Who you calling recruit?

433
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,700
You're a Brownsville sign-up.

434
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,400
I seen you. I been a Ranger
since Franklin.

435
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,900
That's a week and two days.

436
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,800
I know about life on the trail.

437
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,600
One more week, you'll be
eligible for retirement.

438
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,800
Watch it, recruit.

439
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll shoot that lip off
at 40 paces.

440
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
Name's Berry.
Berry Smith.

441
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,000
Berry? Like blueberry?

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,300
Like elderberry to you.

443
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,000
Sergeant sent me
to fill out the dab.

444
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,200
Dab's a usual
three or four Rangers.

445
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,600
We eat together, scout together.

446
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,300
It's us three
and Sandoval.

447
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
He's dab leader.

448
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Means we care
for his horse

449
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,200
care for his weapons.

450
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,500
(gunshots)

451
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,500
(whooping and cheering)

452
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,000
(gunshot)

453
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,100
Boy rides a horse like
he's riding his sister.

454
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
He knows he's doing
something wrong.

455
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,100
Ten cents says
he's saddle sore.

456
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,200
20 cents says he's
dead by Sunday.

457
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,600
Ain't taking that bet.

458
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,900
Anybody see the way this scout
killed those bandits?

459
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
Anybody see the way
this scout

460
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
killed those bandits?

461
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,200
(rapid gunfire)

462
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,900
Damn!

463
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,600
Sam, I'll bet you I can draw

464
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,800
faster than you can say
"peppercorn."

465
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,600
Peppercorn.

466
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,400
Just say it.

467
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,100
Pep-pep-pep-pep-pep...

468
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,200
(gunshots)

469
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,900
Fast!

470
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm fast, I'm fast

471
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
- I'm fast!
- So fast you're six feet under.

472
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Missed that target
every time, Mr. Durham.

473
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,900
Gun's no good unless
you got smarts with it.

474
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,900
Yes, sir, Captain.

475
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,000
Frank, from now on

476
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,500
Mr. Durham pays
for his ammunition.

477
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,200
A penny a miss.

478
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,500
Yes, sir, Captain.

479
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
(gunshots)

480
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,300
(tin can falling)

481
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,700
Peppercorn.

482
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,500
FISHER:
I'm telling you,
General Cortinas

483
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,700
the Republic of Texas
is there for the taking.

484
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,000
What you're suggesting
is full-scale war.

485
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,800
The Union Army's up north,
fighting the Indians.

486
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,500
Hell, there ain't no law
south of Austin.

487
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,800
We heard McNelly's
been commissioned

488
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,700
to start up the Rangers.

489
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,000
McNelly's got 30 men,
General, 30.

490
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,000
We'd have an army.

491
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,800
For the next shipment, senor...

492
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,000
we will meet you.

493
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,400
- Shit!
- Damn, Dunnison.

494
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,300
Ain't there anything
you're good at?

495
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,100
I'd love to show you, Scipio,
but I don't think

496
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,800
we'll be meeting any women
along the way.

497
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,600
Dunnison, you rope
yourself a woman

498
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,800
I'll drink the Rio Grande.

499
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,200
(laughing)

500
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
(chuckling)

501
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,400
You want something, Sam?

502
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,500
(stuttering):
When you're wri-wri-writing

503
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,600
for the Captain in his tent

504
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,800
you see any ma-ma-maps in there?

505
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Maps?

506
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,200
I seen the ma-maps he s-studies
with the s-sergeant

507
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
and they're pretty b-b-b...

508
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,800
Bad, Sam?

509
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,400
Mm-hmm.

510
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,500
My pa-pa-papa taught me

511
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,500
how to blaze t-t-trails
and k-k-keep maps.

512
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,700
Might be
wo-wo-worthwhile

513
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
having somebody
to ma-ma-make maps

514
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,700
of the t-t-territory

515
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,700
while we ride.

516
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,100
DUNNISON:
Captain, Mr. Walters
was speaking to me

517
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,200
about the charts and maps
you're working with

518
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,700
and he wanted
to present you

519
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,000
with what we think
is a preferable scenario.

520
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,400
Sam.

521
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,800
W-W-Well...

522
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,500
Captain, I w-w-wanted

523
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
to s-s-see...

524
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,500
I w-wanted to s-see

525
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
if you're the kind of man

526
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,500
who'd beg for his
life like a dog

527
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,000
or swallow the bullet
like a sorry soldier.

528
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,500
(grunts and groans)

529
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,000
Stay down!
Stay down, you son of a bitch.

530
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,800
Well...

531
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,400
Captain Cutthroat McNelly...

532
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,200
the man the whole Union
Army couldn't kill.

533
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,600
Shot down by Sam Walters

534
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
of San Antone.

535
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,000
Fisher knows

536
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,800
you're riding the Rangers,
Captain.

537
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,500
He's put a sweet price
on your sad hide.

538
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,700
(pained groaning)

539
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,800
Suck my spurs,
you secretary!

540
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,200
I brought a bullet
for you, too.

541
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Turn around, McNelly.

542
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,400
And stop your shifting
or I'll shoot.

543
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,500
Brave Sam Walters...
shot McNelly in the back.

544
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
(groaning)

545
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,900
How's that
for a storybook?

546
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,200
Turn around, McNelly.

547
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Right in the back,
Sam shot him.

548
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
Right in the back.

549
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
I said

550
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,000
turn around!

551
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,500
(gasps)

552
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,400
(music)

553
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,300
(sighs quietly)

554
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,800
(clicks tongue)

555
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,400
(horse whinnies)

556
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,500
You riding somewheres,
Mr. Dunnison?

557
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Riding out
of Ranger Company, sir.

558
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,900
Company's captain

559
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,100
was nearly killed
due to my conduct.

560
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,200
I don't presume myself welcome
to wear this anymore.

561
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,500
Were you set to ride off
with that horse, Mr. Dunnison?

562
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
That's a Ranger's horse.

563
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,900
I was hoping I would not be
sent away without a horse, sir.

564
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,700
But hoping to be sent away?

565
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,500
You were nearly killed,
and I was the reason.

566
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
I hired Sam Walters on,
Mr. Dunnison.

567
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,800
He stood my scrutiny.

568
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,400
He could've taken his shot at me
at any time.

569
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,900
He had 30 Rangers shined on,
not just you.

570
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,900
Rangers' horse,
Mr. Dunnison.

571
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,900
You ride out,
that horse is stolen.

572
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,900
My men will hunt you down.

573
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,200
Rangers' boots, Rangers'
clothes, Rangers' weapons.

574
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,700
You walk out,
makes them stolen, too.

575
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,400
So it seems to me,
Mr. Dunnison

576
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,300
the only way you
escape a warrant

577
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,900
is to remain a Ranger.

578
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,200
(hooves thundering)

579
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,900
Fisher keeps an outpost
around this mesa.

580
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Freshwater spring
on the other side.

581
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,900
Water for the horses when
they come from raids.

582
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,500
But do we know
how many?

583
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,000
Shouldn't we know how many?

584
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
Round that mesa

585
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,000
they'll spot us
well too soon.

586
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,300
Need to send a patrol.

587
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Berry, Durham, Dunnison

588
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,500
ride with Sandoval and me.

589
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,300
Taking a scout, Captain?

590
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,300
Get yourself shot.

591
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,600
Scipio, go get yourself shot.

592
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
And don't get shot second;
get shot first, Scipio.

593
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
In fact, shoot yourself, Scipio.

594
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,100
Get it over with.

595
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,500
That's the Rangers' way.

596
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,000
(men talking in distance)

597
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,100
(horse approaching)

598
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
Five men. Fisher's men, sir.

599
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,500
Armed, and they got
a supply wagon.

600
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,300
- Sandoval.
- Yes, sir.

601
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,400
Our mission is

602
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,000
to capture these men
at all costs.

603
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,300
But I want the cost
to be on their side.

604
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,000
When the shooting starts,
these targets

605
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,700
will be shooting back...
not like practice, men.

606
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,300
Anyone surrenders,
we question them

607
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
then send them to
Austin for trial.

608
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,100
Remember...

609
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,300
you hesitate, you're dead.

610
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,800
(neighing)

611
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,800
(neighs)

612
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,000
Where are you wandering
off to, huh?

613
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,200
Cheval, huh?

614
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,000
What woman

615
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,200
lost hold of you, huh?

616
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,700
Drop your guns! Stay down!

617
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,000
Texas Rangers!

618
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,600
Say your prayers,
sons of bitches!

619
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,300
Ambush!

620
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,300
(neighing)

621
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,500
(yelling)

622
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,600
Someone throw me a cartridge!
I'm out!

623
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,300
Someone throw me

624
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,500
a cartridge!

625
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,000
Found one.

626
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,300
Wha... uh...

627
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,800
(yells)

628
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,600
(crying)

629
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
(both groaning)

630
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,200
(rapid gunfire)
- Get down!

631
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,700
You said there were
five men! Five!

632
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,000
I ain't no scout!

633
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,400
You hear me?
I ain't no scout!

634
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,700
I'm a dag-blasted shooter!

635
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,700
Give me that!

636
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,400
We surrender.

637
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,300
We surrender.

638
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,300
(sighs)

639
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,400
So, ladies, where to next?

640
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,300
Say your names.

641
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,200
Anton Marsele,
from New Orleans.

642
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Jean-Pierre Marsele.
Son frere.

643
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,800
Marsele brothers.

644
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,400
Horse thievery
and livestock

645
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
extortion of
merchants and widows

646
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,000
kidnapping...

647
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,400
destruction
of property.

648
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,000
You boys should've stayed
in New Orleans.

649
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,600
Why don't you give us
some more to write in here?

650
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,300
(men gasping, horses neighing)

651
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,200
Attendez! Attendez! Attendez!

652
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
We rode for King Fisher.

653
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,500
The saddles were stole

654
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,200
from Sutter Ranch
in Austin.

655
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,800
With cattle, 400 head.

656
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,300
Ten ranch hands died
at the Sutter Ranch.

657
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,400
We kill no one.

658
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,700
Fisher did.

659
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,900
We work for you now.

660
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
- For you.
- Oui.

661
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,700
You work for the Rangers
as a spy?

662
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
- Oui.
- Oui. Oui, for the Rangers.

663
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,100
For the Rangers.

664
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,600
Ca va marcher,
ca va marcher.

665
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,900
Ils savent pas
a propos des autres.

666
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,400
C'etait pas marque
dans le mandat.

667
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,100
Mr. Dunnison?

668
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,100
- Sir?
- What'd they say?

669
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,400
They said, "This will work,
this will work.

670
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,300
"They don't know
about the others.

671
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,400
It wasn't in the warrants."

672
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
Sandoval.

673
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,300
(men gasping, horses neighing)

674
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,500
(choking and gasping)

675
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,000
These bandits
went down shooting.

676
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,400
Surrender never crossed
their minds.

677
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Their rules, not mine.

678
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,000
But I'll play by them.

679
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,700
We're Rangers, men.

680
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,100
We got right
on our side.

681
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,500
Scipio.

682
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
Treat her fine...

683
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,300
rifleman.

684
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,500
DUNNISON:
You said we would take
those men prisoner

685
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,000
take them to Austin,
take them to trial.

686
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,500
We did the trial.

687
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
That was no trial.

688
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
A trial can run a long
time, Mr. Dunnison.

689
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,000
Some can run
up to a year.

690
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,200
A year is something
I do not have.

691
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,000
In the state of Texas,
killers hang.

692
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,500
And if they're not killers,
but we think they're killers

693
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,200
and we don't even stop
to check the warrants?

694
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,600
How long will the war go on...

695
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,600
preacher?

696
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,900
Until the wicked are dead

697
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,100
and the meek shall
inherit the earth.

698
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,300
Are we the meek?

699
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,600
The meek will inherit the earth,
Mr. Dunnison.

700
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,000
Someone's got to go
and get it ready for them.

701
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,000
There are bodies

702
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,400
to be buried.

703
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,000
Bury them.

704
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
(coughs and spits)

705
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,900
(retching)

706
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,900
(flies buzzing)

707
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Some kind of work, ain't it?

708
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,000
We done killed six men dead.

709
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,600
We ain't even got our $40 yet.

710
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,300
(hooves thundering)

711
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,000
(music)

712
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,500
Cattle come through here.

713
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,800
100, maybe 200.

714
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,500
Whoa, now! Get on back!

715
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,400
Rangers got
the Marsele brothers.

716
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,100
What about the gun?

717
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
McNelly destroyed it.

718
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,900
Damn.

719
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,600
30 men and horses.

720
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
About a hundred beeves.

721
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,100
You know that's
marshland prairie, Captain.

722
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,200
Might want to track them
to a little better terrain.

723
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,600
No better terrain for 20 miles.

724
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,300
And better for us
means better for them.

725
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,400
Might be better to wait.

726
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,900
Wait till what,
they reach reinforcements?

727
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,200
Sandoval?

728
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,100
30 of them, 30 of us.

729
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,000
We wait...
they may have 300.

730
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,100
We'll ride
at full gallop.

731
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
They'll see us
on the prairie

732
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,200
and take
defensive positions.

733
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,100
Shoot at the target
forward of you only

734
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,000
and you keep shooting

735
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,600
till you taste that
outlaw's blood.

736
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,000
No prisoners, Rangers.

737
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,500
(men shouting)

738
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,800
Fire!

739
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,500
Hyah!

740
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,900
Get every last one!

741
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,600
(screaming)

742
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,700
Get the others out of hiding.

743
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Let's go, boys!

744
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,600
(all shouting)

745
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,500
(gunshots continue)

746
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,300
Jesus Christ.

747
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,800
(horse whinnies)

748
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,100
(grunting)

749
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,000
We don't have the manpower.

750
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,800
They set us up!
We're trapped!

751
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,400
(screaming)

752
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,100
(neighs)

753
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,200
(screaming)

754
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,800
(screaming)

755
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
Goddamn.

756
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,400
(yells)

757
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,800
(horse whinnies)

758
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,700
God, not me.

759
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,500
Oh, please God!

760
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,900
Oye, muchacho, por aca.

761
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,000
Stand back!

762
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,400
Stand back!

763
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,600
Don't move!

764
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,800
Oh, God! Oh, God! Get up!

765
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,200
(gun cocking)

766
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,600
(horse whinnies)

767
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,900
Leave them alone!

768
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,300
Their dead alone!

769
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,900
(groans)

770
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,900
No!

771
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,700
Sergeant!

772
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,100
I'm getting you
out of here.

773
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,400
Help me! I surrender!

774
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,400
Help me!

775
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,600
I surrender!

776
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,500
Help me!

777
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,500
I surren...

778
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,500
Retreat, Rangers!

779
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,800
Retreat!

780
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,500
(gunshot rings out)

781
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,000
DURHAM:
Thank God!

782
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,900
We're retreating!

783
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,900
Come on!
We're retreating!

784
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,100
We're retreating!

785
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,100
Giddup! Let's go!

786
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,300
Next time you train your Rangers

787
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,700
train them
how to run!

788
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,700
Go with God, McNelly.

789
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,400
If the son of a bitch
will have you.

790
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,800
Ride.

791
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,500
(horse whinnies)

792
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,800
(birds chirping)

793
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,400
(chirping continues)

794
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,800
(whispers):
Thank you very much.

795
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,900
Fisher will have
ridden on by dusk.

796
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,700
We'll return to Palo Alto...

797
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,200
get our men.

798
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,800
We'll resupply
and get new recruits

799
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,700
at the ranch
of my old friend

800
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,000
Richard Dukes.

801
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
What'd they do with our men?

802
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,700
Cap...

803
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,800
Cut my men down.

804
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,300
Cut them down.

805
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,400
Jesus...

806
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,600
Captain!

807
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Por favor...

808
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,500
kill me.

809
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,700
Captain!

810
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,000
Kill me now.

811
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,200
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

812
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,400
Slow and easy,
comprende?

813
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,600
Nice and easy,
little lady.

814
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,900
Your war's over.

815
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,100
Slow and easy.

816
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,100
(men yelling and whistling)

817
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,700
MAN:
Riders coming in!

818
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,900
Ready yourselves!

819
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,100
Begging your pardon,
Mrs. Dukes.

820
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,800
There's riders, Captain.

821
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,300
Whoa.

822
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Are those the Rangers,
Daddy?

823
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,200
Caroline,
take your sisters inside.

824
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,800
Come on, girls.
There's going to be

825
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,400
a lot of dirty cowboys around.

826
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,400
Got 12 men to bury.

827
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,900
You want to say
some words, Leander?

828
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,300
(sniffling)

829
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,500
WOMAN:
You're welcome, sir.

830
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,100
(indistinct conversation)

831
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,900
Oh, thank you,
ma'am.

832
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,900
No, no.

833
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,200
(belches)

834
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,000
Thank you, ma'am.

835
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,400
Tom?

836
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,600
Wouldn't be so bad
to be a ranch hand

837
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,700
around here,
would it?

838
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,300
Probably don't
get shot at much.

839
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,700
I wouldn't even
mind, as long

840
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,600
as it was her
doing the shooting.

841
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,800
(laughing)

842
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,600
DURHAM:
Up there earlier

843
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,200
she was studying me
like an encyclopedia.

844
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I hate to disappoint you,
George, but she was eyeing me.

845
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,400
(laughing):
The hell she was!

846
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,900
She was. She was studying me
like a Bible.

847
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, you study an encyclopedia
a lot harder

848
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,500
than you study a Bible, Lincoln.

849
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,100
Get all that buckshot
out of your ass yet?

850
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,600
Ten more minutes.

851
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,200
Ten more minutes
is about how long

852
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,800
you got to live,
unless you give up

853
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,400
that bath to the man who
could've killed you

854
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,800
when he met you.

855
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,300
George, you couldn't kill
a bottle of mescal

856
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,400
- with a pack of Mexicans.
- Give up the bath.

857
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,800
What the hell are you doing?

858
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,900
- Get the hell out of here!
- Give up the bath!

859
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,400
Have a seat, sonny.
Just stay on your side!

860
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,400
Oh, you had
to see that.

861
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,400
She was eyeing me.

862
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,500
(horse whinnies)

863
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,300
(knock at door)

864
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,900
Come in.

865
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,700
Mr. Dunnison.

866
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,500
(McNelly coughs)

867
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,900
November 17.

868
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,300
The men fought bravely,
but I believe it was my mistake

869
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,600
to lead them into a battle
on such arduous terrain.

870
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,500
With no natural defencements,
they were unprepared

871
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
to withstand
such a pitched encounter.

872
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,000
I had believed that the numbers
were in our favor.

873
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,600
I had believed that the raiders

874
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,000
would not be as
well-disciplined

875
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,100
as they were.

876
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It was a disastrous decision.

877
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,000
Would you agree with that,
Mr. Dunnison?

878
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,700
DUNNISON:
It's awfully
kind of you, Miss

879
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,800
to be taking care of
such wrecks like us.

880
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,900
Awfully kind.

881
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,800
Well, it must've been hard.

882
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,100
Were many young like you?

883
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,200
Rest assured, Miss,
we didn't go down
without a fight.

884
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,200
I killed two raiders
myself at close range.

885
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,300
I may have killed a couple
more in the charge.

886
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,800
What were their names?

887
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,600
Pardon?

888
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,200
You had warrants for them,
I trust.

889
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,100
Well, the raiders opened
fire on us, Miss.

890
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,100
There wasn't time to
consult the warrants.

891
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,400
Well, it's just as well.

892
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,200
You know a man's name,
makes it harder

893
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,300
to kill him,
now, doesn't it?

894
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,900
They're outlaws, Miss.

895
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,400
We're Rangers.

896
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,600
When you kill a man
for stealing some cattle

897
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,200
you are saying that his life
is worth as much as that steer.

898
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,600
Leaves you a whole state
full of men thinking that way

899
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,400
and treating other men
the same.

900
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,000
We ride to protect
the state of Texas.

901
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,100
You ride to balance
the blood on the scales.

902
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But some of you...

903
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
like your friend...

904
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,300
I look into his eyes,
and I can see it clear.

905
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,500
He's no killer.

906
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,400
George? You looked in his eyes?

907
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,800
(chuckling):
George?!

908
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,600
DURHAM:
Miss.

909
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,100
Ladies.

910
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,300
Hey.

911
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,500
You talking to her?

912
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,300
I got nowhere,
George.

913
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,700
Gunslingers.

914
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,800
She likes
gunslingers.

915
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,000
(horses neighing)

916
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,100
Sergeant, what's going on?

917
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,700
Training exercises,
it looks like.

918
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,100
Who organized this?

919
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,300
Philadelphia did.

920
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,600
About damn time.

921
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,800
Peppercorn.

922
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,700
State'll pay you $40 a month.

923
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,500
Four men to a dab.

924
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,300
Seven dabs to a company.

925
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,300
You get your pay
from Sergeant Armstrong.

926
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,400
You get your orders from me.

927
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,300
Fire!

928
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,400
(whooping)

929
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,000
(indistinct conversation)

930
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,300
Senorita.

931
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,600
Si.

932
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,200
La Senora wanted you
to have these.

933
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,700
They're yours to keep.

934
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,600
You're safe now.

935
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,400
You're with the Rangers.

936
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,100
Those devils
can't hurt you anymore.

937
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,800
Who say they cannot hurt me
no more?

938
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,300
John Armstrong says.

939
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,900
Senora is...

940
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,900
very kind.

941
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,900
(sniffing)

942
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,400
Who were those men?

943
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,100
Name to me
the devils that hurt you.

944
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,600
We're after those men.

945
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,500
I heard them say they were going
to Amargosa

946
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,900
to do a raid at
the Logan ranch.

947
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,200
(kissing softly)

948
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,900
Thank you.

949
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,100
ARMSTRONG:
Come on, recruits,
let's get ready to move out!

950
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,400
Come on, pack it up!

951
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,500
Let's get ready
to move out, boys.

952
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,900
Let's pack her up!

953
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Saying good-bye?

954
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,900
We, uh...

955
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,900
shot five bandits
over at Palo Alto.

956
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,600
Well, I mean...

957
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,200
I killed.

958
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,300
Judy didn't.

959
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,400
But I was
riding Judy.

960
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,900
Hell, they was dead before they
even saw me draw. Blam, blam!

961
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,000
George, sell it
in the dime stores.

962
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,900
She'd... make
a good ranch horse.

963
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,400
I think you'd make
a good ranch hand.

964
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,800
DUNNISON:
Miss Dukes

965
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,700
hope he hasn't tired you
with all his stories:

966
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,100
All the bad men he's killed,
the hangings, the shoot-outs.

967
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,900
It's so hard
to keep track.

968
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,900
Actually, we were speaking
of a horse.

969
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,600
He killed a horse?

970
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,600
(horse burrs)

971
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,100
Miss Dukes.

972
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,800
McNELLY:
Amargosa's a
40-mile ride

973
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
but we'll make it
by nightfall.

974
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,000
Send a man
into Shepardton.

975
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,400
Get a telegram
to Victor Logan.

976
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,300
Tell him to get his
family out of there.

977
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,500
And the Rangers are coming.

978
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,800
(horse neighs)

979
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,900
I made the lady a
promise, Captain.

980
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,800
We're taking her
to Carmargo.

981
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,300
Hyah.

982
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,200
(cattle lowing)

983
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,500
(lowing in distance)

984
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,700
Another hour

985
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,500
and it's sunup.

986
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,300
Any sign over there?

987
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,300
Dust, Captain.

988
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,500
Dust and sky.

989
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,700
Night... why
wouldn't they

990
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,900
raid at night?

991
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,900
She wasn't dead.

992
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,300
I don't follow.

993
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,200
The rest were dead.

994
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,500
And she wasn't.

995
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,800
So why'd they leave her behind?

996
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Hey, Captain!

997
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,600
Captain, wait up!

998
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,000
(gasps)

999
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
They let you live! Why?

1000
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,600
To say what? What?!

1001
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,100
- Stop! You're scaring her!
- Amargosa?

1002
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,300
Le dije que no se!

1003
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,300
Captain, she told you
what she heard them say!

1004
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,500
What they wanted her
to hear!

1005
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,600
What they wanted her to say!

1006
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,300
Rangers!

1007
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,200
(sobbing)

1008
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,500
Men, we are riding back
to Dukes.

1009
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,800
Dunnison, Donavan, Scipio

1010
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,600
stay behind
with Sergeant Armstrong.

1011
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,700
Take Perdita
as our prisoner.

1012
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,500
Yeah, but what if
they still raid?

1013
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,900
We're not at the raid,
goddamn it!

1014
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,900
The raid can only be
at the Dukes Ranch!

1015
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,900
Hyah. Hyah!

1016
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,600
(horse whinnying)

1017
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,800
(creaking in wind)

1018
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,800
(horse neighs in distance)

1019
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,200
(gunfire, galloping hooves)

1020
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,800
(men shouting)

1021
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,300
(gunfire continues)

1022
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,600
Perdita.

1023
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,000
You didn't know.

1024
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,100
You couldn't have.

1025
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,700
Please forgive me.

1026
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,200
(groans)

1027
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,900
(grunting)

1028
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,300
Hyah! Hyah!

1029
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,700
Andale, mas rapido!

1030
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,600
Ho! Ho!

1031
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,600
Rapido, ho!

1032
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,000
(groaning)

1033
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,700
Duncan!

1034
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Scipio!

1035
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,200
Hyah!

1036
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,400
Hyah! Hyah!

1037
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,300
(horse neighs)

1038
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,400
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1039
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,000
Yo, andale.

1040
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,800
Yo, andale.

1041
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Andale!

1042
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,500
Arriba, arriba!

1043
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,400
Andale!

1044
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,600
Hyah! Hyah!

1045
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,800
Hyah!

1046
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,400
Hyah!

1047
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,200
(horse whinnies)

1048
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,700
(grunts)

1049
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,600
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1050
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,900
(whimpers)

1051
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,300
Kill me, tejano.

1052
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,400
You want to kill me,
kill me!

1053
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,000
- Or do you want
to have me first?
- I don't want

1054
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,200
to kill you and I don't want to
hurt you... I want to know why.

1055
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,700
They know I'm from Carmargo.
They are riding to Los Cuevas.

1056
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,100
They say if I don't say
Amargosa, they kill mi familia.

1057
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,800
Tonight?
They ride tonight?

1058
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,900
I say Amargosa for
mi padre, mi madre...

1059
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,400
(hoofbeats)
- Where are they?

1060
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,300
They're riding
for Mexico

1061
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,800
crossing at Los Cuevas.

1062
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,200
Tell George
to get word

1063
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
to the company.

1064
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,300
We're taking to the trail.

1065
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,100
Who taking the trail?

1066
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,600
You and l... Mexico.

1067
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,800
Richard!

1068
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,200
(horse neighs)

1069
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,500
Richard!

1070
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,100
(hammers cocking)

1071
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,100
(sighs)

1072
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,800
Where's Richard?

1073
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,100
(cattle lowing)

1074
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,800
(men whistling)

1075
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,700
Rangers!

1076
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,400
Drive the herd!

1077
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
These are Mexican beeves now!

1078
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,000
And the man is

1079
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,800
a Mexican man.

1080
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,900
(hooves thundering)

1081
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,500
Captain Leander McNelly.

1082
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,300
I've been waiting for you.

1083
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,100
The young
soldier there

1084
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,900
has been talking my
ear off since dawn

1085
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,000
trying to work
himself a trade.

1086
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,800
One Mexican juggler

1087
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,400
for one Texas clown.

1088
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,200
You send Captain Dukes
across that river

1089
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,500
we'll send your girl.

1090
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,800
You have my word.

1091
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,500
I could use a man
like you, Captain...

1092
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,100
a man who can shoot,
a man of his word.

1093
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,600
Man could live like a king
in Mexico.

1094
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,500
If I was your wife
and boys

1095
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,300
Mexico's where I would have
hightailed it by now

1096
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,500
instead of waiting
for a killer like you.

1097
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,400
Maybe they're here now,
McNelly...

1098
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,400
living like kings in Mexico.

1099
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,300
Captain Dukes for the girl.

1100
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,000
He means nothing to you.

1101
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,700
Ah, but he means something
to you.

1102
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,400
Richard!

1103
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
Now we send her!

1104
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,900
- No!
- Stand down, Mr. Dunnison.

1105
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,100
DUNNISON:
What she did was
to save her family.

1106
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,600
She's a victim, not an outlaw.

1107
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,800
Stand down...

1108
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,600
or be shot.

1109
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,000
This is not
what Rangers do.

1110
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,900
Captain, show them

1111
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,800
the difference between them
and us.

1112
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,700
Stand down, Dunnison.

1113
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,900
The state of Texas commands you

1114
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,000
to leave its lands
now and forever.

1115
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,100
You will be prosecuted
and imprisoned

1116
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,300
should you
ever return.

1117
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,200
(gun uncocking)

1118
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,200
May God have mercy on your soul.

1119
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,500
PERDITA:
I did what you say!

1120
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah, and you'll do what I say
tonight, and you'll do

1121
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,200
what I say tomorrow.

1122
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,200
Maybe one day
we'll charge admission.

1123
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,800
(whips knife)

1124
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,600
(guitar music playing)

1125
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,900
(cattle lowing)

1126
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,200
Don't know which
I want to do worse:

1127
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,200
Kill the son of
a bitch up there...

1128
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,700
or go teach him
how to play.

1129
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,300
McNELLY:
Take up your pen, Mr. Dunnison.

1130
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,100
No notebook, sir?

1131
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,000
Take up your pen.

1132
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,300
November 19.

1133
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:55,000
I, Leander McNelly,
being of sound mind

1134
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,400
do hereby bequeath
my land and property

1135
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,500
to the Texas Rangers

1136
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,600
to do as
they see fit.

1137
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,000
The following
items excepted:

1138
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,500
My Navy Colts,
field glasses

1139
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,300
and books
on military strategy...

1140
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,800
to Lincoln Rogers Dunnison...

1141
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
a soldier fit to lead.

1142
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:25,000
My Bible I would like
to be buried with.

1143
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,800
That is all.

1144
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,900
(writing)

1145
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,700
(pen clinks into inkwell)

1146
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,000
Sir...

1147
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,400
In that fort will be
far more than 30 men.

1148
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,500
They'll never expect us
to cross

1149
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,100
into Mexico.

1150
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:45,300
They'll be well-armed
and well-provisioned.

1151
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,800
They've been riding
for weeks, sir.

1152
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,200
It's their first night back.

1153
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,800
The women, the liquor...
they'll crave sleep.

1154
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,700
(McNelly coughing)

1155
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,400
(retching)

1156
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,600
Bones, start your men
at the front gates.

1157
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,100
Baker.

1158
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,300
Yes, sir.

1159
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,900
Take you men high
to the ridge.

1160
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,800
Come on.

1161
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,700
(water splashing)

1162
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,000
(yells)

1163
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,100
Armstrong, Durham, take your men
low to the back gates.

1164
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,700
Dunnison and I

1165
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,900
will take the front.

1166
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,700
Now let's wake them up.

1167
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,500
(all yelling)

1168
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,400
Caballeros, the tunnels!
Come on!

1169
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,900
Let's get in the tunnels!
Move!

1170
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,900
Rangers!

1171
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,900
(screaming)

1172
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,900
Vamonos, apurate!

1173
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,200
Charge!

1174
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,700
(whooping and cheering)

1175
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,100
We're in, Rangers!

1176
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,200
Oh, shit!

1177
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,600
We're surrounded!

1178
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,800
What the hell?!

1179
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,700
(screams)

1180
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,900
We're surrounded in the back!

1181
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,500
(grunting)

1182
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,200
(McNelly cocking gun)

1183
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,400
(yelling)

1184
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,200
(gun hammer clicks)

1185
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,300
I'm out of cartridges!

1186
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,200
Someone throw me
a cartridge!

1187
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,000
(gunshots in distance)

1188
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,900
(hammer clicks twice)

1189
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,700
(grunts)

1190
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,700
(grunts)

1191
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,000
Vamos, rapido!

1192
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:51,000
Heard you were fast.

1193
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,500
(yells)

1194
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,600
Faster than that.

1195
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,700
(grunts)

1196
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,200
(grunts)

1197
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,400
(gun hammer cocks)

1198
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,300
This is only
gonna hurt

1199
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,700
for a second.

1200
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,900
Maybe two.

1201
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,500
(cocks hammer)

1202
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,300
Kill him, Mr. Dunnison.

1203
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,200
Kill him.

1204
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,800
You kill me,
I'll kill him.

1205
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,300
(gunshots)

1206
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,900
(cocks gun)

1207
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:53,200
(gunshots)

1208
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,900
(gunshots)

1209
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,000
(grunts)

1210
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,200
Go!

1211
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,900
Captain!

1212
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,700
Captain, they want
to surrender.

1213
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,100
They want to surrender.

1214
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,600
No surrender,
right, Captain?

1215
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,400
No prisoners, right?

1216
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,600
We take back our cattle.

1217
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,000
We take them as prisoners.

1218
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
We take them to trial.

1219
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,000
But, Captain...

1220
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,500
Those are the terms.

1221
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,500
(cattle mooing)

1222
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,800
(Rangers whistling)

1223
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,700
(cattle lowing in distance)

1224
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,300
(McNelly coughing inside)

1225
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,200
He wants to see you boys.

1226
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,600
(coughing)

1227
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:01,100
When they remember us,
Rangers...

1228
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:08,300
let them remember us not
as men of vengeance...

1229
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,900
(coughing)

1230
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,100
But... as men of law...

1231
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,800
and justice.

1232
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,800
(music)

1233
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,400
(approaching footsteps)

1234
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,500
(sighing)

1235
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,300
Can't help but think
that they're watching.

1236
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,200
Yeah...
I bet they're up there

1237
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:15,600
riding like
the old days.

1238
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,700
(horse whinnying)

1239
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,100
Hey, Caroline!

1240
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,300
(laughing)

1241
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,700
Rounding up cattle.

1242
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,300
We'll see you tonight!

1243
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,800
He'll make
a good rancher.

1244
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,700
And whatever else
you've got in mind

1245
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,500
he might be all right
at that, too.

1246
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:34,900
He's a good man, Mr. Dunnison.

1247
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,500
Ride safe, Mr. Dunnison.

1248
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,100
Rangers...

1249
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,500
Ride out!

1250
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,200
(horses whinnying)

1251
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,700
(hooves pounding)
