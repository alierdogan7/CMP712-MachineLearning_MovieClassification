00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:04,437
Sean. Take a breath, tell me what happened.

178
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:05,970
Vic went down the road to get some help,

179
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,136
and soon after, a car came
from that same direction.

180
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,403
And as it passed, I could see the driver,

181
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:11,970
and it was Ed Gorski.

182
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:15,538
I'm afraid he might have kidnapped her.

183
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:28,667
[tires screech]

184
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:37,653
Vic!

185
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:39,487
Sean!

186
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:41,520
Sean!

187
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:52,386
<i>Walt: Hey, it's me. Who's there?</i>

188
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,219
[Sighs]

189
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,219
Hey, Sheriff. It's Ferg. What's up?

190
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,486
I need you to run a license plate...

191
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:02,753
Victor Tango November 1-2-7-6 X-ray.

192
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,186
Not sure of the state...
probably Pennsylvania.

193
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:07,087
Is it Darius?

194
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,653
<i>No. The driver is Ed Gorski.</i>

195
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:12,120
Wait.

196
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:14,219
Ed Gorski, as in...

197
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,953
<i>Ferg, just run the plate.</i>

198
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:18,386
I got reason to believe
Gorski abducted someone.

199
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:20,154
<i>Who?</i>

200
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:21,319
Vic.

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,088
<i>Radio me back when you know something.</i>

202
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:29,355
[Sighs]

203
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:37,195
Man: Sheriff!

204
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,426
Gorski?!

205
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:45,160
Where's Vic?

206
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:48,261
If you hurt her, you're a dead man.

207
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:49,927
You cowboys.

208
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:54,027
You think every problem can
be solved with a gunfight.

209
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,027
I'm not gonna tell you anything about Vic

210
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,395
until you put down your
weapon and turn around.

211
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:21,927
What'd you do to her?

212
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:23,294
I didn't do anything with her,

213
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,393
and I got nothing to do with any of this.

214
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:27,761
But I do think she's in some trouble.

215
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,061
Thanks for this.

216
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:36,027
If you had nothing to do with this,

217
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:37,860
why are you out here?

218
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,357
- I've been keeping an eye on her.
- You mean stalking her.

219
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,923
The language of most
stalking laws is pretty vague.

220
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:48,792
I like to think of myself
more as a guardian angel.

221
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:51,370
Doesn't look like you
are doing a very good job.

222
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:54,106
So, what happened to Vic?

223
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:56,106
I don't know.

224
00:10:56,107 --> 00:10:59,006
But I do know what happened to Sean.

225
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,872
Hey. Thanks for stopping.

226
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,238
So, it's kind of an emergency.

227
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,939
We got in a car accident,
and then my... my wife...

228
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,240
[all grunting]

229
00:11:08,973 --> 00:11:11,672
[tires squeal]

230
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:14,205
Walt: You get a license plate number?

231
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,706
The plate had been removed.

232
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,405
Where's the last place you saw Vic?

233
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:21,572
Heading up a driveway back that way.

234
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,505
How far that way?

235
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:25,173
About 2 miles.

236
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:31,173
That's Chance Gilbert's place.

237
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:38,338
So, where you headed?

238
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,906
I don't know, actually.

239
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,772
My husband wanted it to be a surprise.

240
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:43,272
Oh, one of those.

241
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:45,338
Yeah. [Laughs]

242
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,906
I... so, the phone.

243
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,639
Can I use it?

244
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,639
Only after we feed ya.

245
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,272
It's the least we can do.

246
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:59,173
Besides, these two failed
to tell you something.

247
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:01,439
What's that?

248
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,393
We don't have a phone. Sorry.

249
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:05,987
They were dishonest.

250
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,572
What did I tell you about that?

251
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,856
Technically, I never said we had a phone.

252
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,790
Hey Derrick...

253
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,529
Don't you lawyer me.

254
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,919
Okay?

255
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,530
Sorry, sir.

256
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,476
I don't trust phone companies.

257
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,616
They're all crooks in cahoots with the NSA.

258
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,380
So I just simply cut the line.

259
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:32,980
Snip snip snip. [Chuckles]

260
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,980
Yeah, a lot of people are doing that.

261
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,746
Do you have a cellphone
that I could borrow, then?

262
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:39,147
Reception sucks. Dead spots all over.

263
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:40,880
What did you say your name was, again?

264
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,514
- Vic.
- Hmm.

265
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:45,481
Mustard or Mayo, Vic?

266
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,621
Were out of mayo.

267
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:48,651
Ah, shit.

268
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:50,742
Mustard, it is.

269
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:52,527
Classic yellow.

270
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,060
I'm... I'm good. Thank you.

271
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:56,093
You don't like a bologna sandwich?

272
00:12:56,094 --> 00:12:59,627
What kind of American doesn't
like a fried-bologna sandwich?

273
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,294
- Come on.
- [Chuckles] It's not that.

274
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:02,993
It's just, if you don't have a-a phone,

275
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:04,494
I should get back to my husband.

276
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,327
Well, take him a sandwich.

277
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,260
Make one for the road, please.

278
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:10,627
You know, we ate on the way, so...

279
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:12,826
Thank you, but I-I should just go.

280
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:14,527
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

281
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,160
- You are?
- Yeah. I should go.

282
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:17,893
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

283
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:19,561
It's a free country, Vic.

284
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:33,394
[Door opens]

285
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:42,094
We've been expecting you, Deputy Moretti.

286
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:51,245
I'd feel a lot better if you'd
give me one of my guns back.

287
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:55,845
I wish I could, but I can
tell you don't trust me.

288
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:58,037
And I feel like you wouldn't be able

289
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,870
to resist the temptation to arrest me

290
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,804
on your trumped-up stalking charges.

291
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:06,337
And right now, we can't
afford that distraction.

292
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,770
- Vic is in real trouble.
- Is she?

293
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:12,303
Or is this just another one of your games?

294
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:15,337
Like sending her husband
a photo of Vic and me.

295
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,170
What makes you think I sent a picture?

296
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,337
You wrote "32" on the back.

297
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:23,837
Vic told me that was a little
secret between the two of you.

298
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:28,370
Did she describe room 32 to you?

299
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:31,270
I wasn't interested in anything
but the fact that it proved

300
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,236
you never left Wyoming,
like you were told to.

301
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:37,403
So, Ed, apart from stalking my Deputy,

302
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:39,750
what else you been up to?

303
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:41,917
You made any friends?

304
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,696
I-I found a dentist I liked, thanks to you.

305
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,597
I wouldn't say we're friends.

306
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:49,863
How do you know Chance Gilbert?

307
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:54,279
The names out here, you
just don't get 'em back east.

308
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,713
So it's just a coincidence
that Vic disappears

309
00:14:57,714 --> 00:15:01,213
in his part of the county at
the same time as you appear?

310
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:04,813
Sheriff, I'm just looking out for Vic.

311
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:07,913
I have no idea who this Chance is,

312
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:09,579
<i>but clearly you do.</i>

313
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,713
He's a survivalist...

314
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:16,013
anti-government, end-of-days type.

315
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:18,746
Like a crazy cult leader?

316
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:20,113
Worse.

317
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:22,746
The guy's smart.

318
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:25,113
He served as his own
attorney in a murder trial

319
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:27,579
and got himself acquitted.

320
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,780
I killed his brother a few
years ago in a standoff.

321
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,213
He's angry about it.

322
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,479
Oh, great.

323
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,046
You think he abducted Vic?

324
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:39,479
<i>I think you did.</i>

325
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,579
Maybe with Chance's help.

326
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,880
And this guy, Chance... is he violent?

327
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,513
Quite.

328
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,046
And what about the other
guys, the ones who took Sean...

329
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,579
who are they?

330
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,846
Some are family.

331
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:56,046
Some are like-minded disciples.

332
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:59,047
Okay, stop.

333
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:07,046
I didn't have anything to do with this.

334
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,180
You believe me now?

335
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:11,946
Nope.

336
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:14,247
[Sighs] I didn't think so.

337
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,448
I think I'll be keeping your sidearm.

338
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:21,613
<i>Branch: So, who's Ed Gorski?</i>

339
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,679
- Huh?
- Come on, Ferg.

340
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,080
When Walt mentioned his
name, you knew who he was,

341
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,346
and now he's supposedly kidnapped Vic?

342
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:32,046
Who is this guy, and
why is it such a secret?

343
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:37,180
There was an incident
at a motel a while ago.

344
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:40,813
I think Gorski is someone
Vic knew in Philly...

345
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:42,880
And...

346
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:45,947
And was maybe having an affair with.

347
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:51,279
What kind of incident?

348
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,013
He was beaten up pretty badly.

349
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,405
I didn't know if it was Vic's
husband who did it, or...

350
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,138
[Keyboard clacks]

351
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,071
I didn't know what happened.

352
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:01,971
But Gorski never filed any charges.

353
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:06,138
Ed Gorski was a cop in
Philadelphia, but he got fired.

354
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,604
When?

355
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:12,171
Right after Vic showed up here.

356
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:15,271
Chance: Now, how do we find out information

357
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:19,004
when the subject won't cooperate?

358
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,004
Check her pockets?

359
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:24,472
Or maybe it makes more sense
for your mom to do that.

00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:48,572

Look at that.

363
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:54,071
A cop losing her gun.

364
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,271
Shame on you.

365
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:58,904
What are you doing here, Victoria Moretti?

366
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:01,371
Walt Longmire send you, huh?

367
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,938
I told you that my husband and I had...

368
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,938
yeah, you and your husband, you had what?

369
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,438
We had car trouble.

370
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,572
You had car trouble.

371
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:11,004
We almost ran into a bear.

372
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:14,338
Right down the road from my house?!

373
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,305
A grizzly or a black bear? I want to know.

374
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,971
Look, I don't know who
you are or what you want.

375
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:22,472
- You're such a liar.
- You don't believe me?

376
00:18:22,473 --> 00:18:24,472
Now, why should I believe you?

377
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:27,505
My husband is out there
right now with our car.

378
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,238
Well, I'm not saying you haven't
thought everything through

379
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,305
and you don't have a good cover story,

380
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,139
but I'm not buying it.

381
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:41,637
Gorski looks to have been pulled
into an I.A. investigation.

382
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:44,371
A cop named Bobby
Donalato committed suicide

383
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:46,038
during the hearing process.

384
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,505
Then Gorski and two others
were kicked off the force.

385
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,059
And the whistleblower

386
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,648
that started the whole
investigation process was...

387
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,715
Officer Victoria Moretti.

388
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:01,049
Did you know about any of this?

389
00:19:02,283 --> 00:19:03,582
No.

390
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,282
Seems like Gorski's got

391
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,015
a pretty legitimate ax to grind with Vic.

392
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:11,550
If he's got her, we better find him quick.

393
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:16,815
This guy hates catalogs.

394
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:18,282
This guy hates the government

395
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,748
and everyone he thinks represents it.

396
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:25,681
So, where does the Sheriff's
Department fall in his mind?

397
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,783
Pretty firmly on his list of enemies.

[Grunts]

399
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,282
Maybe you can answer this for me, Walt.

400
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,582
How does a woman like Vic
end up with someone like Sean?

401
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,681
Dunno.

402
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:51,915
I mean, he didn't even put up a fight

403
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,848
when those guys abducted him on the road.

404
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,781
Probably the smartest
thing in the circumstances.

405
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,616
They were armed... he wasn't.

406
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:02,149
I know, but how do you not
get in one punch... or try?

407
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,149
Not everyone can be a cop.

408
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,882
My point exactly.

409
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:08,616
There's no way Vic belongs
with someone who isn't a cop.

410
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,149
I just don't get it.

411
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,715
<i>You mean you don't get
why she's not with you.</i>

412
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,715
No. That's not what I'm saying.

413
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:18,149
I'm... an acquired taste, no question.

414
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,582
I get why she needed a
break from me, but Sean?

415
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,516
Mr. milquetoast?

416
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:25,681
It's just baffling to me.

417
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,415
I don't know.

418
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,516
He probably looked pretty good

419
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:31,316
after a couple of months of you.

420
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,282
Vic and I were good together.

421
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:38,182
Really?

422
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,449
I heard you were married
and didn't tell her.

423
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,815
Bad timing.

424
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:44,015
I married the wrong woman,
then I met the right one.

425
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:46,382
- I made the wrong decision.
- No.

426
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:48,349
You didn't make a decision at all.

427
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,015
You tried to have it both ways.

428
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,648
Well, that's not gonna
be a problem anymore.

429
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,182
I got a divorce.

430
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:54,449
But Vic got married.

431
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,982
Right.

432
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:58,483
Sure hope Sean makes it
out of this in one piece.

Uh-huh.

437

Seems like we're probably gonna
have to call in some backup.

438
00:21:27,216 --> 00:21:29,482
It'll mean more coming from you.

439
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:31,015
No.

440
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:33,582
Sheriff, you said this guy was violent.

441
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,745
Yup.

442
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:37,516
And the last thing we
need is another Ruby Ridge.

443
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:39,882
The only way we get Vic and Sean out

444
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,083
is if Chance doesn't know we're here.

445

Hey, Vic, I can't tell
you I know you that well,

before we picked you up, eh?

you and your wife had some car trouble.

We did.

473

And you sent her all
the way over here, then,

474
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,616

475
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:58,715

00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:02,535
For God's sakes, stay put!

535
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:15,067
She must be in there.

536
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,568
They'd never risk shooting a patrolman

537
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,201
unless they had something to hide.

538
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:22,234
You better hope Vic's alive.

539
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:25,535
Or that won't be the last
man that goes down today.

540
00:27:28,402 --> 00:27:31,101
[Vic coughing, vomiting]

541
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:38,801
Oh. This isn't good.

542
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:41,000
You clearly have a concussion.

543
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:44,368
A concussion is the least
of our problems right now.

544
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:46,334
[Breathing heavily]

545
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:48,334
Did you not hear those gunshots?

546
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:49,368
Yeah.

547
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:52,534
I heard one... gunshot.

548
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:55,967
But, you know, that
could just be one of those

549
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:59,067
psychotic hillbillies taking
target practice, you know?

550
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:01,501
[Gagging, vomiting]

551
00:28:01,502 --> 00:28:05,167
Oh, baby. Oh, you need a doctor.

552
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:06,468
Sean! Sean!

553
00:28:06,469 --> 00:28:08,368
I'm fine.

554
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:11,534
No, you're not fine!

555
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,668
But it's okay.

556
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:17,000
This guy just wants this pass code, right?

557
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:18,000
Right?

558
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,934
So, uh, why don't I go...

559
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:22,668
Negotiate with him...

560
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,934
tell him I'll give him the pass code

561
00:28:24,935 --> 00:28:26,368
in exchange for setting you free.

562
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:27,368
Yeah.

563
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:30,368
Sean...

564
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:35,201
Honey, they didn't
blindfold either one of us.

565
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:40,435
They have no intention of... letting us go.

566
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:49,867
That stupid pass code is the only thing

567
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:52,201
that's keeping us alive right now.

568
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:54,669
We have something they think they need.

569
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:02,368
If you gave them my cellphone,
would they find anything?

570
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:03,735
[Sighs heavily]

571
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,302
Yeah, I, um... I called Walt.

572
00:29:17,202 --> 00:29:19,101
What do these guys want?

573
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:22,101
Why does he keep asking about Walt?

574
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:25,368
Because I think this is the
guy that killed his wife.

575
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,034
[Sniffles]

576
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:30,501
Walt had his picture on his wall,

577
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,568
and he came out to question
Chance a couple weeks ago,

578
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:37,267
so he knows that Walt is honing in on him.

579
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:39,568
[Sniffles]

580
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,101
I just... I walked up the wrong driveway.

581
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:45,802
I had no idea he lived here.

582
00:29:48,602 --> 00:29:50,234
But it's okay.

583
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:55,334
If you called Walt, he
will... he will be here.

584
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,568
[Door opens]

585
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,601
Chance: Incoming!

586
00:29:58,602 --> 00:30:00,401
[Screams]

587
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:02,769
[Door closes]

588
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:07,434
Walt.

589
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:10,967
Walt. Walt. Walt.

590
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:13,967
[Crying]

591
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:16,702
[Screaming indistinctly]

592
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:22,368
[Breathing shakily]

593
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,791
[vehicle approaches]

594
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:59,958
[Indistinct conversation]

595
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:15,992
[Generator whirring]

596
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:38,758
[Grunts]

597
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,614
[Lid closes]

598
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:17,047
[Grunts]

599
00:32:19,013 --> 00:32:21,553
[Sighs] I counted 20 of 'em... all armed.

600
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:23,620
But I didn't see Vic or Sean.

601
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:25,553
I thought I knew why
Chance was overreacting

602
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:27,353
to Vic's appearance,

603
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,154
but I just got a second reason.

604
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,187
They got a dead federal agent
in an underground freezer

605
00:32:32,188 --> 00:32:35,054
on the West Side of the compound.

606
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:37,154
They killed an FBI agent?

607
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,253
No, he's a census officer...
went missing two years ago.

608
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:43,754
It was a federal case...
not my jurisdiction.

609
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:49,121
Chance probably thinks we're onto him.

610
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:50,453
Probably thinks that's why

611
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:52,353
I came to talk to him two weeks ago.

612
00:32:52,354 --> 00:32:54,187
Okay.

613
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:56,353
So, we can't call for federal backup,

614
00:32:56,354 --> 00:32:58,553
or a lot of people will die, as you said.

615
00:32:58,554 --> 00:33:02,388
And we can't walk away if Vic is in there.

616
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,286
So we wait.

617
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:08,453
After dark, we go in and find her.

618
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,921
Branch: Walt!

619
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:54,453
Walt: Psst.

620
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:55,821
[Grunts]

621
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:02,854
I'm looking for a friend
of mine... blond lady.

622
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:05,087
- She in there?
- She's government.

623
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,887
And I know who you are. You're the Sheriff.

624
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:10,353
- You killed my dad.
- Is she in there?

625
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:11,620
Tell us where she is.

626
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:13,720
All we want is to get
her out of there safely.

627
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,520
Walt: And her husband.

628
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,054
They're on trial.

629
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,887
Chance doesn't like to deliver a sentence

630
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:20,520
without due process being served.

631
00:34:20,521 --> 00:34:21,553
That's the law.

632
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:23,453
Whose law?

633
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:26,520
Chance's.

634
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:29,021
[Indistinct conversations]

635
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:39,754
[Conversations stop]

636
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,653
Chance: You two have something
to say before the trial begins,

637
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:46,620
like an opening statement of some sort?

638
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,920
Yeah.

639
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,620
Yeah?

640
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,720
Um, I'll tell you what you want to know.

641
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:58,687
Um... The pass code is 1325.

642
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,221
You'll see that I called the Sheriff,

643
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:01,587
but he's not looking for you.

644
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:06,920
Well, thank you, Sean.

645
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:09,055
I appreciate it.

646
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,286
Now, why can't you be

647
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:14,386
more like your fake husband, here, eh?

648
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:15,820
What? No! No! No! No! No!

649
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,820
Listen up, everybody!

650
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:23,553
The court, in appreciation of
the defendant's cooperation,

651
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,397
hereby pardons Sean Keegan.

652
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:27,587
- No, but you have to let my wife go, too!
- Get him out of here!

653
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:29,854
No, Sean!

654
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:31,787
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't! Get that away from me!

655
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:33,887
Get that away from me!

656
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:35,386
Get him out! Get him out!

657
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:37,386
- [Indistinct shouting]
- Let my wife go!

658
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:40,487
He's got a pardon.

659
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,155
Silence!

660
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,253
[Shouting stops]

661
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:49,355
The court is in session.

662
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:56,123
Deputy Victoria Moretti,

663
00:35:56,124 --> 00:35:57,856
you are being accused of the following.

664
00:35:57,857 --> 00:36:01,856
First, as a representative
of the U.S. government,

665
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:05,090
you are being held accountable
for the murder of my brother,

666
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:08,856
committed by your superior,
one Walter Longmire.

667
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:14,756
Secondly, you're accused of
trespassing sovereign territory.

668
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:18,516
Third, by misrepresenting
yourself and your intentions,

669
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:20,008
you're in violation

670
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:23,889
of all international diplomatic statutes.

671
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,689
And finally, espionage.

672
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,622
[Breathing shakily]

673
00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:32,023
This is bullshit.

674
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,323
Where is Sean?!

675
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,789
When I defended myself,

676
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,223
I didn't get to put the
U.S. government on trial,

677
00:36:40,224 --> 00:36:42,223
but I fared okay.

678
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:44,323
<i>Now that you're on trial,</i>

679
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:47,990
you don't get to question our legitimacy.

680
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:53,789
Did Walter Longmire send you here?

681
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,990
No.

682
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:57,235
Oh. [Chuckles]

683
00:36:57,236 --> 00:36:58,769
Let me rephrase this.

684
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,602
What does Walter Longmire know? Hmm?

685
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:03,602
[Breathing shakily]

686
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:07,301
H-he knows that you had his wife killed.

687
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:09,602
That's why he was out
here a couple of weeks ago?

688
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:11,235
Yes.

689
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:16,301
And he believes I-I killed
this Miller... Miller Beck guy?

690
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,368
Yes.

691
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,468
Multiple murders across state line.

692
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:22,568
Oooooh!

693
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:24,402
Are the "feds" coming?

694
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:25,502
[Laughter]

695
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:27,135
God, I hope so.

696
00:37:27,136 --> 00:37:29,235
What did you say?

697
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:31,335
[Breathing shakily]

698
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:36,402
I said, "God, I hope
so," you crazed nut job!

699
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:40,602
Listen, you pious bitch.

700
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:42,602
Every person in here

701
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:46,301
has made a courageous, informed choice

702
00:37:46,302 --> 00:37:48,502
to separate themselves
from a corrupt society

703
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:52,402
and to live here with their
own wits, skills, and laws.

704
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,802
Yeah, so one can argue that crazy people

705
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:58,668
are those just like yourself,

706
00:37:58,669 --> 00:38:02,735
who blindly follow others.

707
00:38:02,736 --> 00:38:06,268
You see, in here, we're all united.

708
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:11,369
But out there, you're all divided.

709
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:15,468
[Breathing heavily]

710
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:16,802
So, uh...

711
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:20,268
Do you have any more names
you want to call me? Huh?

712
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:23,735
Before the jury announces the verdict?

713
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,702
Chance! Chance!

714
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,901
Walt Longmire's here.

715
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:28,435
Go. Move.

716
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:30,101
[Breathing shakily]

717
00:38:30,102 --> 00:38:31,635
Did you put a bullet in him?

718
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:33,235
No, sir. He got my gun.

719
00:38:33,236 --> 00:38:34,869
[Laughs]

720
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,735
Well, what the hell does he want?

721
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:39,603
He wants to settle out of court.

722
00:38:43,536 --> 00:38:45,369
Longmire!

723
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:49,135
Hey, show yourself!

724
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:53,735
Walt: There are a couple of
ways this thing ends, Chance.

725
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:56,301
Now, you can kill us,

726
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:59,368
but the feds will send an army after you.

727
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:01,835
You may take down a few of them,

728
00:39:01,836 --> 00:39:03,735
but they'll kill all of you.

729
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:07,135
There's another way.

730
00:39:09,703 --> 00:39:12,402
[People murmuring]

731
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:22,402
How about I let all your people go...

732
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,070
You let all mine go?

733
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,769
Everybody goes free...

734
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:33,535
Except you... And me.

735
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:37,869
I'll stand in for all my people's crimes.

736
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,901
You stand in for all of yours.

737
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:42,934
What are you proposing, huh?

738
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:44,535
A duel?!

739
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:46,835
Remember what Thomas Jefferson said?

740
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:50,268
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed

741
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:52,535
"from time to time...

742
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:54,635
With the blood of tyrants."

743
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:57,936
<i>"Patriots and tyrants."</i>

744
00:39:59,469 --> 00:40:02,469
What do you say, Chance?

745
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,269
I'm thinking.

746
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:12,901
Give one of your cars to Vic and Sean.

747
00:40:12,902 --> 00:40:16,169
I'll send them out with
one of my guys here.

748
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:22,769
My people are safe...

749
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,934
I'll let yours go.

750
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:28,869
And you and me can settle this.

751
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:32,869
Give me your word

752
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:36,502
that my people can leave
as free men and women.

753
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:39,970
You got a deal.

754
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:46,735
Somebody get me the keys to the granada.

755
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,968
And get Sean.

756
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:50,968
[Breathing shakily]

757
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:52,802
Walt, you can't do this!

758
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:55,602
It's okay, Vic.

759
00:40:55,603 --> 00:40:57,536
You'll be all right.

760
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,536
Here's the granada keys, Chance.

761
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:15,536
You... hold it right there.

762
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,169
I'll take those.

763
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,569
Toss him the keys.

764
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:29,903
Go with him, Vic.

765
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:35,070
[Grunts]

766
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:39,269
[Breathing heavily]

767
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:05,402
Everybody head out to our backup position.

768
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:07,568
You heard me! Get out!

769
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:08,934
Now! Come on! Move!

770
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:12,736
[Engines turn over]

771

[Chuckles]

773
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:12,235
I saw your guys gun down
that highway patrolman

774
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:13,702
in cold blood.

775
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:15,235
Yeah?

776
00:43:15,236 --> 00:43:20,869
They saw you do the
same thing to my brother.

777
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,802
Did you kill that Federal Census Agent?

778
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,769
[Gasps]

779
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,901
When did you find out?

780
00:43:28,902 --> 00:43:31,402
This afternoon.

781
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:34,602
That's not why you came poking around,

782
00:43:34,603 --> 00:43:36,835
like, a couple of weeks ago?

783
00:43:36,836 --> 00:43:38,568
No.

784
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:42,269
I wanted to know if you killed my wife.

785
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:49,202
Did you?

786
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:52,835
No.

[Chuckles]

788
00:43:56,536 --> 00:43:59,202
I don't suppose you'd
let me arrest you quietly?

789
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:05,901
I've been fighting my whole
life for my right to freedom.

790
00:44:05,902 --> 00:44:09,301
I fled a fascist country

791
00:44:09,302 --> 00:44:12,301
to find my freedom here in America.

792
00:44:12,302 --> 00:44:16,934
I'm not giving up now, Sheriff.

793
00:44:16,935 --> 00:44:19,703
You see, I've been fighting too long.

794
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:28,201
So, how do we do this, now, eh?

795
00:44:28,202 --> 00:44:31,568
Well...

796
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,901
I guess we count it off.

797
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:36,869

798

Have you been in my laptop?

810
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:56,949
You tell me.

811
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,872
Did you break into my home?
