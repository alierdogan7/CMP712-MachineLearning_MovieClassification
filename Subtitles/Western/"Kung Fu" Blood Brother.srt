Kung Fu 1x04 - Blood Brother

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,900
As quickly as you can,
snatch the pebble from my hand.

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,000
When you can take the pebble from
my hand, it will be time for you to leave.

4
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,300
Time for you to leave.

5
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,700
-We ain't allowed to give that information.
-The man who wrote it is my brother.

6
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,600
My half-brother.

7
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,500
-This letter's more than six years old.
-Yes.

8
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,200
Mister, any of them drifters
hang around this town...

9
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,300
...more than six months,
they're doing good.

10
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,800
You better try the next town.

11
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,400
Thank you.

12
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,600
Please come with me.

13
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,100
-l am Caine.
-l am Lin Wu.

14
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Hey, mister,
anything else you want?

15
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,300
These boxes.

16
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,400
l am acquainted with a man
named Lin Wu.

17
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,800
Perhaps this is the same man.
Could you tell me--?

18
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,900
Mister, you've got everything
you're gonna get.

19
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Thank you.

20
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey, hold still, l'll put out the fire.

21
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,700
Just trying to help out. Never mind
all that good whiskey going to waste.

22
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,400
How we gonna to put out the fire?

23
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
-Throw him in here, huh?
-That's a good idea.

24
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Enough!

25
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,300
Why, what'd you say?

26
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,000
He has had enough.

27
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,700
All right, boys, take it slow.
Back it up. Gently.

28
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,600
-Did you hear him?
-Heard it, memorized it and filed it away.

29
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,700
That bottle looks empty. Come on,
l'm gonna buy you a drink. Come on.

30
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,300
You risked your own safety
in helping me.

31
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,500
We are grateful.

32
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,300
What l did was little enough.

33
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,100
lt is l who am grateful
for your hospitality.

34
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,500
We don't often have the honor
with strangers in this town.

35
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,500
l am merely passing through.

36
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,200
But it has come to my attention that
a countryman of mine may be living here.

37
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,100
Perhaps you could help me to find him.

38
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,700
lf it lies in our power.

39
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
His name is Lin Wu.

40
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,600
We are very thoughtless.

41
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Our guest has journeyed far
and is doubtless fatigued.

42
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,100
l don't know you.

43
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,500
l am Caine.

44
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Business here?

45
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,800
l am passing through.

46
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,300
Post office, livery stable, saloon.

47
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,400
For a man passing through,
you've been asking a lot of questions.

48
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,700
Only one. Where is my friend Lin Wu?

49
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,200
How do you know he's here?

50
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,100
l saw boxes addressed to him
at the post office.

51
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,100
-Well, he might have left.
-Perhaps.

52
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Suppose you find him gone?

53
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,400
Well, he's....

54
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,100
West side of town. About a mile out.
He's next to the pond.

55
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,400
Satisfy yourself and take some advice.

56
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Forget about him, then go on your way.

57
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,300
-Dundee.
-Sheriff.

58
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,800
l'd like to talk to you about your boy.

59
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,300
Oh, well, come on in. Talk.

60
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,800
-You heard about the firecracker stunt?
-No.

61
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,200
Well, a bunch of kids
were hazing old Soong.

62
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,800
Soong? One of the nicest Chinamen
in the world. ls he all right?

63
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He's alive.

64
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,000
ls Greg involved?

65
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,100
-Well, you might say he stopped it.
-Oh, glad to hear it.

66
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,400
Dundee, if it happens again,
l'm gonna charge him.

67
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,500
Maybe you should be talking
to some of those other boys.

68
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,300
Yeah, maybe, but we both know
who's top dog in that outfit, don't we?

69
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, it won't happen again.
Soong's too smart. He'll stay away.

70
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,600
l'm talking about them staying away
from him or anybody else.

71
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,100
Well, l'll talk to Greg.

72
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,600
Poor old Soong. You wouldn't want
to know an easier man to get along with.

73
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,400
lf all Chinamen was like him, l wouldn't
mind if the town was full of them.

74
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
You know how much he gave
for the church...

75
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,200
...knowing all along
he'd never see the inside?

76
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,700
While l'm here, you know Lin Wu?

77
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
That the Chinaman lives
at the edge of town?

78
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,900
Yeah. You happen to know where he is?

79
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Who knows what makes
a Chinaman come and go?

80
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,600
They don't think
the way the rest of us do.

81
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,900
l'm talking about one particular man.

82
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,000
So am l.

83
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,200
What are you doing here, John?

84
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,500
My name is Caine.

85
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,200
Sure, John.

86
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,600
Who asked you here?

87
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
l'm looking for a friend.

88
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,000
We all are, John...

89
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,000
...but you won't find one here.

90
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,900
You know you're breaking the law?
Trespass.

91
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,500
What is trespass?

92
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,400
Sticking your nose where it don't belong.
Asking questions!

93
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
Randy.

94
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,900
l meant no offense.

95
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,700
Of course not.

96
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Now you've got two,
three good hours of daylight left.

97
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Give you plenty of time
to collect your things.

98
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,000
All right?

99
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,100
l seek no trouble.

100
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,100
Get a good start before dark.
Understand?

101
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,100
-l hear what you say.
-Sure you do, John.

102
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,700
Disciple Caine, Disciple Lin Wu,
you are both excellent young men.

103
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,300
Your masters are well-pleased.

104
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,700
You have both learned so well
that it is hard to choose between you.

105
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,000
However, a choice must be made.

106
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,600
lt is the Shaolin way that only one...

107
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,400
...may step upward into the mysteries
of the order at this time.

108
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,100
lt lies between you two.

109
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
May l speak, honorable sir?

110
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,700
Let it be Disciple Caine,
for l know him to be my superior.

111
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,600
That is for the masters to decide.
A contest has been arranged between you...

112
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,000
...in which you are enjoined
to strive your utmost.

113
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,000
May l speak, honorable sir?

114
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,500
Let it be Disciple Lin Wu,
for l do not wish to contend against him.

115
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,700
Your friendship and your compassion
do you both honor...

116
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,900
...but the ancient ways carry purpose
and may not be forborne.

117
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,500
The contest will take place tomorrow.

118
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,800
-Pa?
-Yes, son. Come in.

119
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,200
You look nice. You going over
to see the McKenzie girl?

120
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,900
-Yeah.
-You could do worse.

121
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,100
-Pa, l....
-Yes?

122
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,100
Are you in trouble, son?

123
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
l don't know, Pa.

124
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Tell me about it.

125
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,400
Well, the other night
me and some of the boys....

126
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,600
-We were just out for a little fun, Pa.
-That the Chinaman, Lin Wu?

127
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,200
Who was there?

128
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,600
Just some of the boys.

129
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,700
Well, you know how l feel
about this kind of thing.

130
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,700
Easiest thing in the world
for it to get out of hand.

131
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,000
-That's why l never wear a gun.
-l didn't have a gun, Pa.

132
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,600
lt's just as well.
Sheriff's been asking questions.

133
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,300
Didn't seem to be anything too serious.
lt could be a whole lot worse.

134
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,800
l just hope it teaches you something.

135
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,300
A man's lucky if he can learn a lesson
without doing too much harm.

136
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,200
-You don't supposed the sheriff--?
-Oh, let him think what he likes.

137
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,100
He doesn't know anything.

138
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,800
Hello.

139
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,700
-Miss Livvy McKenzie?
-Yes.

140
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,700
l am a friend of Lin Wu.

141
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,600
Come in.

142
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,200
Sit down.

143
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Thank you.

144
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Do you know where he is?

145
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,800
That is the question l came to ask you.

146
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,000
lt was empty.

147
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
He was supposed to have
come here last night.

148
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,500
May l ask why?

149
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,900
-You have pain?
-Headaches.

150
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,000
-You consulted him as a physician?
-Oh, yes, a lot of us do.

151
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,200
He's helped me.
No one else ever did before.

152
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,100
When was the last time you saw him?

153
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,900
Oh, two nights ago.

154
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,600
-Here? ln this house?
-Yes.

155
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,900
And he has sent you no word?

156
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,600
None.

157
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
-Should l leave?
-No.

158
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,300
Greg.

159
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,900
-This is--
-Caine.

160
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,000
-l'm surprised to find you here.
-Yet l am here.

161
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,500
-On what business?
-The same, looking for a friend.

162
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,500
-Well, you won't find one here either.
-Greg--

163
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
You keep looking in all
the wrong places.

164
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,400
Caine.

165
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,300
-ls there any way l may help you?
-Why would you help me?

166
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,700
-You have been of service to my father.
-And you are an obedient son?

167
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,400
Suppose your obedience itself
were an injury to your father?

168
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,100
What has happened may happen again.

169
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
Tell me of Lin Wu.

170
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,700
You are a man. You must be angry.

171
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,500
To hide such a feeling is to increase
its force 1 000 times.

172
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
lt is forbidden to talk of Lin Wu.

173
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,400
But you already have.

174
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Caine.

175
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,200
Tell me about Lin Wu.

176
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,700
l'm keeping him in there overnight
for safekeeping.

177
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:11,100
His own safety. ln the morning,
l'll get him as far out of town as l can.

178
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,500
lf he's smart, he'll keep moving.
lf he's lucky, he'll make it.

179
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,100
You cannot keep him.

180
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,000
Why?

181
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,600
He is a priest of the Shaolin Temple.

182
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,700
Yeah? So?

183
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,100
A Shaolin priest can walk through walls.

184
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,600
lt is said that listened for,
he cannot be heard...

185
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,800
...looked for, he cannot be seen...

186
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,400
...felt, he cannot be touched.

187
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Bernie will take you home.

188
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,400
Stay there.

189
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,300
-What are you doing with that rifle?
-Nobody's gonna get hurt, Pa.

190
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,300
Nobody?

191
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,300
The Chinaman who broke out of jail,
we figured he'd go to Soong's house.

192
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,900
He had his chance, Pa.

193
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,700
lf you have to use it, don't miss.

194
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,500
-See anything yet?
-No.

195
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Elvis, take two or three of the boys,
go around and cover the back.

196
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
A Shaolin priest can walk through walls.

197
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,300
-You wish me to go?
-l wish you never had come.

198
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,700
You can't help Lin Wu.

199
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,200
ls Lin Wu, then, dead?

200
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,800
Why won't you answer?
A man cannot live his whole life in fear.

201
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,800
What have you to fear?
You are a Shaolin priest.

202
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,100
-lf l had your strength....
-You have.

203
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,900
Only look for it.

204
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,800
lt has long been my dream to enter
the Shaolin Temple as a student.

205
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,900
-Tell me of Lin Wu.
-Why must you pursue this?

206
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,900
Why not let the dead rest?

207
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
Then he is dead.

208
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,000
Yes.

209
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,800
The contest will continue
until one of you touches the floor.

210
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,700
He who remains on the platform prevails.

211
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,400
You are both enjoined
by your vows to do your utmost.

212
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
Tell me how he died.

213
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,300
Like so many of his countrymen,
at the hands of white men.

214
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,800
-Why?
-Why was my father tormented? Ask them.

215
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Where is the body hidden?

216
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,600
Near his house, there
is a large area of swampland.

217
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,400
A body put there may be lost forever.
Unless one knows where to look...

218
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,500
...it is hopeless to search.

219
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Someone knows.
The men who put him there.

220
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,100
<i>It is they who will lead us to Lin Wu.</i>

221
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,300
ls he here?

222
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,400
Please, he's a young and foolish boy.
Forgive him.

223
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,700
-What did he say?
-Come on!

224
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
He told him of the swampland.

225
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,700
Right over there.

226
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,100
-There's nothing there.
-Look, l heard it.

227
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,200
You heard a splash.
lt could have been anything.

228
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,600
lt's Cole.

229
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,300
We'll be shooting each other next.

230
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,900
There's somebody with him.

231
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,900
Who else is there?

232
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,800
Florin, Arlo, a few of the others.

233
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,100
Get them.

234
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,100
You know what you've done?

235
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,000
All he had to do was follow.
You led him right to the spot.

236
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,300
Now you've got no choice.

237
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,700
You all here?

238
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,500
Yeah.

239
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,200
We're going into the swamps
and form a skirmish line 5 feet apart.

240
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,400
See anybody else...

241
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,400
...shoot.

242
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,400
This is a lawful order.

243
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,300
Come out here on the bank.

244
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,100
l guarantee l'll see any man in jail
who disobeys this order. Now.

245
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,600
Doing a little frog hunting, sheriff.
Any law against that?

246
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,700
Mr. Dundee...

247
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,900
...l could charge every man here
with murder.

248
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,100
Murder of who, sheriff?

249
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
This man...

250
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,200
...has been beaten to death.

251
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,300
l'll have the names of every man here
on warrants for murder.

252
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,500
A little premature, sheriff.
Don't you need an indictment first?

253
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,900
l'm calling for an inquest
for tomorrow morning.

254
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,900
An inquest means witnesses.

255
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,600
People who are willing to testify,
raking up a lot of muck...

256
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,700
...do nobody any good.
For what? You're over your head, sheriff.

257
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,900
You know how the people
in this town feel.

258
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Nothing like an outsider
stirring up trouble to bring us together.

259
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,500
When you have your inquest, sheriff,
you'll find we all feel the same about this.

260
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,800
-Have you learned nothing?
-You are new to this country.

261
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,900
You must understand, no jury
will indict a white man...

262
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,000
...for what has been done
to one of our people.

263
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,300
Yet you must appear.

264
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,100
-Tell me why.
-lf you stay away...

265
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,700
...it will be an acceptance
of things as they are.

266
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,400
lf you appear at the inquest, your very
presence will be a demand for justice.

267
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,300
The presence of your son, your wife
and your daughter will be worth even more.

268
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,600
You ask me to subject my family to shame?
To hurt? For what reason?

269
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
How can they find safety in a fortress
whose walls will burn...

270
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,000
...whose windows will not stop a bullet,
whose doors will yield to anyone...

271
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,600
...with the strength to force them?
How can you hide...

272
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,900
...when the more you remain unseen,
the more they will feel free to seek you out?

273
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,800
May l speak, Father?

274
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,300
lt is my duty to obey.

275
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
l respect and revere my father...

276
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,900
...but l have never been prouder
to be his son than last night...

277
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,700
...when he risked my safety...

278
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,500
...and the safety
of my mother and my sister...

279
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,900
...in accordance with the wishes
of the priest.

280
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,100
Who else was with you that night?

281
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,200
Well, it's hard to say.

282
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,400
A lot of people coming and going.
You know how it is.

283
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,600
l remember Pop Fuller,
he dropped by for a drink.

284
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,700
Was Elvis Cooper with you?

285
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,100
-Or Greg Dundee?
-l just don't remember.

286
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,600
Did you go out to Lin Wu's
house that night?

287
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,500
Yeah, l think l was out there.

288
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,600
Did you see Lin Wu?

289
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,800
Well, that's pretty hard to say.

290
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,600
They all look alike to me.

291
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,000
All right, you can step down.

292
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,000
Greg Dundee, come to the stand, please.

293
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,000
Raise your right hand.
Do you swear to tell the truth...

294
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,100
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

295
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,300
l do.

296
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,100
-Can l ask a few questions, Bert?
-Yes.

297
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,000
You're acquainted with Livvy McKenzie?

298
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Yes, l know her.

299
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,400
Do you have an understanding with her?

300
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,200
More than one.

301
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,500
-Are you engaged to her?
-Yes, l guess you might say we're engaged.

302
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,000
Did you know that she was being
treated by Lin Wu?

303
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
-Treated?
-For a medical complaint.

304
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,900
Are you saying there's
something wrong with her?

305
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,600
She was being treated by a doctor.

306
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
She had headaches. ls that so bad?

307
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,400
Bad enough to call in a doctor
for treatments.

308
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,900
Well, she was worried about them.
Scared she'd end up like her mother--

309
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,400
Who died in an asylum
after suffering from headaches?

310
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,400
Greg, did you know that she was treated
the night he died?

311
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,300
You were...

312
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,900
...outside the house when he came out.
You, Randy, Elvis, a couple of others.

313
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,900
All right.

314
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,400
Did you go in to see Livvy
after he left?

315
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,800
-No.
-No.

316
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,200
Well, weren't you curious
to see how she was?

317
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,600
Whether the treatment helped?

318
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,100
Greg?

319
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,700
Or was it that you didn't want
to see her?

320
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,400
You couldn't stand the idea that...

321
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:28,500
...he might have touched her?
A Chinaman putting his hands on her body.

322
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,300
Dirty, yellow, Chinamen hands
on a white woman.

323
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,200
You followed him home, all of you.

324
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,800
-You took him out--
-Teach him a lesson.

325
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,100
Beat him a little bit,
so he'd keep his hands off white women.

326
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,300
-Lousy, yellow--
-And by the time you finished the lesson...

327
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,800
...he was dead.

328
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,000
So you buried him.

329
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,200
And it was over. No great loss, a Chinaman.

330
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,600
-Laying his dirty, yellow hands on her--
-He never touched me.

331
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,900
He was gentle. So respectful.

332
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,300
He gave me medicines.
He was the only one who ever helped me.

333
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
He worked as a doctor. Some of the rest
of you went to him for help.

334
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,100
You, Edith. May.

335
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,600
-He treated your wife, Alex.
-That's right.

336
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,900
lf any of you can think
of anything he did...

337
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,800
...that maybe we should know about,
stand up and tell us.

338
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,800
You all know these boys.

339
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,900
They're good boys, all of them.

340
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,400
High spirits, maybe. Tomfoolery.

341
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,100
They never meant any harm to anyone.
Just scare the Chinaman a little.

342
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,400
Well, they're kids. They're kids.
They got scared.

343
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,400
They buried the body.

344
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,300
Accident.

345
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,700
They had no reason to hurt him.

346
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,300
Two nights.

347
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,800
Two nights after they beat
a man to death, these same...

348
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,500
...kids walked into Soong's store
looking for someone else. Another lesson.

349
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,400
Of course, they ran into
a different problem there.

350
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,500
You think l can't take him?

351
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,000
One finger on my left hand.

352
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,000
-What is he? He's a slant-eye.
-Come on.

353
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,100
What are we talking about here anyway?
All this fuss about killing a Chinaman?

354
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,000
l mean, who needs a reason? l enjoyed it.

355
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,000
l mean, it ain't as if
we was talking about a man.

356
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
May l speak?

357
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,000
You tell a man he is something less
than a man, and say it often enough...

358
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,700
...and even he will believe it.

359
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,800
The price he pays is easy to see.

360
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,200
The price you pay is hidden,
but it is just as deep.

361
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,400
lt has been called to question...

362
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,400
...whether the death of Lin Wu
was the death of a man.

363
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,000
This letter l found on his body...

364
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,000
...is addressed to Miss McKenzie.

365
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
''Honored Miss:

366
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,700
l ask you to excuse grievous faults
and errors in me...

367
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,700
...for to understand this new language,
this new land...

368
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,900
...occupies my time with great effort.

369
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,300
Be assured that what happened
to your revered mother...

370
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,200
...is of her world, and not yours.

371
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,100
Do not clutch at pain
and pain will pass...

372
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,800
...for l have touched the roots
of your suffering, and they will wither.

373
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,000
ln my country, we say
there is a time for each to die.

374
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,200
lt is not the death that is so drear,
but the fear of death.

375
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Fear is the darkness.

376
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,300
And l wish you to know, gentle lady,
that l am not afraid.

377
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,900
At the end what remains
is not riches, not structures of stone...

378
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,700
...but remembrances of those few people
we have joined spirits with.

379
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,500
Honored lady, l bid you--''

380
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,400
The letter ends.

381
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,000
The purpose of this inquest is to judge
whether there are reasonable grounds...

382
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,600
...to bring a charge of murder
in the death of Lin Wu.

383
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,000
l ask that this jury...

384
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,200
...move an indictment of murder
against Greg Dundee...

385
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,000
...Randy Buckmill, Elvis Cooper, others...

386
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,600
...to be named later.

387
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
So moved?

388
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,600
Yea.

389
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,200
Yea.

390
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,100
Yea.

391
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,300
Yea.

392
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,500
-Yea.
-Yea.

393
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,200
lt is so moved.

394
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,100
Lower away.

395
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,100
May his troubled spirit at last find rest.

396
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,900
-And you?
-Mine will be at peace.

397
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,600
This journey to the Shaolin Temple
is one l had long wished to make.

398
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,100
Student Soong.

399
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,100
Ready to roll.

400
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,000
l will miss you, my father.

401
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,800
And you, old man?

402
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,200
Are your spirits heavy?

403
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,300
Lighter perhaps at this moment
than they have ever been, or will be again.

404
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,700
The father learns from the son.

405
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,400
But the father learns.

406
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,000
lt is perhaps enough.
