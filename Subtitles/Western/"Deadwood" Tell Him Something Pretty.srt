1
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,850
" Tell Him Something Pretty "

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,250
Quit your Goddamn knockin'.
I'm comin'

3
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,410
Casket's come with your name on it

4
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,700
Why tell me in the middle of the night?

5
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,980
Body's inside

6
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,350
Evidently not mine

7
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,920
But I'd as soon make delivery

8
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,300
You'll find out where when I decide.
Good night

9
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,940
I don't like your tone of voice

10
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,771
Who are you, Mr. Utter, for me to care 
what you like or don't?

11
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:21,671
I'm the guy that the next time you see me,
you'd better take a different fuckin' tone with

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,794
Given what's in store, I'm not sure I'll ever learn 
what price I'd have paid for not complyin'

13
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:37,839
Oh, I guess someone lookin' hard might could find you in there 
somewheres, peekin' from under the covers to make a fuckin' threat

14
00:02:55,806 --> 00:03:01,241
Their quality apart, Claudia, failing reception, 
our efforts are lost to the void

15
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:02,371
I understand

16
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,522
Don't say so! Please!

17
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,432
I lose my thought

18
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:14,002
This camp is in mortal danger

19
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:17,171
The man Hearst is a murderous engine

20
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:24,792
My friend Swearengen, aware their combat is unequal, 
feels the appeal of the gory finish

21
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:32,343
Others I've just come to know stand candidates in the elections, 
whose results they know may be moot

22
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:38,801
What, one is disposes to ask, 
in fuck ought a theater man to do?

23
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,503
Of a certainty, our debut's postponement is necessary

24
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:49,970
But unless of one's own volition,
certain is it too that one would not be canceled

25
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:57,790
To prevent that, if need be, even off the boards, 
one would take steps of one's fuckin' own!

26
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,200
Why did you bring me here?

27
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:15,143
I don't know, child

28
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:23,682
What's the point Al having us leave 
I.O.U.s
when Wu can't read fuckin' English?

29
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:29,531
Wu gets back, he'll take Al the I.O.U.s for interpretin', 
find out Al did the rightful thing while he was gone

30
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:31,181
That's big point with Al, ain't it?

31
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,502
When he ain't lyin', Al's the most honorable man 
you'll ever meet

32
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:43,561
Johnny, balance up against this fuckin' Chinese sign 
while I lay my rack on your shoulder

33
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:44,170
Why?

34
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,560
Just shut the fuck up.
Get this meat inside

35
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:48,181
What are you gonna do?

36
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:54,621
Murder

37
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:04,380
Where the fuck you been? 
I fuckin' vouched for you!

38
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:11,483
We're camped up at the Spearfish Meadows,
as not to tip Hearst off till Swearengen can deploy us

39
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:16,101
I mean, I rode into town to tell you, 
but I fell one saloon short

40
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,102
Come on

41
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,012
Lots of Chinks in that meadows up there

42
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:22,791
Is the railroad comin' to camp?

43
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:35,721
To have kept our claim, we'd have had to leave here, you and I, 
so that thugs we'd have had to engage could counter Mr. Hearst's thugs

44
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:40,170
without having the further responsibility of defending us

45
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:42,350
So…

46
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:46,191
we are to sell, Sofia, so that we may stay

47
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,671
To be fair to Mr. Hearst-which is more than he deserves-

48
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:55,683
the price he is paying assigns a great worth to our holdings, 
which lacking expertise

49
00:05:55,745 --> 00:06:00,343
of our own and others now being absent 
who might have provided it,

50
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:05,512
as a practical matter makes refusal absurd

51
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,862
But how I hate to give that man what he wants

52
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:17,051
Your hair has survived my diatribe

53
00:06:18,257 --> 00:06:22,020
If we left, we wouldn't be able to see Mr. Ellsworth

54
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,053
And we are not leaving

55
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:10,571
Your fuckin' throat's gonna be at risk, Hawkeye, in case you don't 
fuckin' realize, which wouldn't bother me except mine's gonna be too

56
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:23,820
Advancing your interests, Mrs. Ellsworth, 
mine and all others, 

57
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,923
what we do here seems natural and proper

58
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:36,453
Mr. Newman, I ask you to ready payment 
to the officers of Mrs. Ellsworth's bank

59
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,940
We'll receive it where we can put it in her safe

60
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:47,573
May I hope, Madam, you do not subscribe 
to this insulting and juvenile precaution?

61
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:54,032
I do not find the precaution juvenile, so many having 
been murdered with whom you've had dealings in this camp

62
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,501
At least you acknowledge the insult

63
00:07:56,848 --> 00:08:03,871
I acknowledge the pretense to civility-
in a man so brutally vicious-as vapid and grotesque

64
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:16,063
Have the gold seen to her bank, Newman.
Have its purity assayed

65
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,910
Let her or her seconds choose the man

66
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:25,750
When that tedium is completed, 
have the documents witnessed as though we were all of us Jews

67
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,073
And bring the business back to me

68
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:37,441
Excuse my absence, Mr. Star, as I hope you'll forgive 
my thoughtless aspersion on your race

69
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:46,462
You stand for local office, but some contests being countywide 
I await wires from the other camps

70
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:53,292
You've changed your scent

71
00:08:53,766 --> 00:09:00,102
Can't shut up! Every bully I ever met 
can't shut his fuckin' mouth…

72
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,882
except when he's afraid

73
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:15,321
You mistake for fear, Mr. Bullock, 
what is in fact preoccupation

74
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:21,350
I'm having a conversation you cannot hear

75
00:09:39,738 --> 00:09:42,010
Oh see, that's just Miss Stubbs now answering my message

76
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,813
I sent her by secret thinking, requesting 
unguent for my bruises

77
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:49,191
Hello hello, Miss Stubbs

78
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:53,501
Joanie : Hello hello, yourself. Hello, Sofia
Sofia : Hello, Miss Stubbs

79
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:57,671
I'm just going to the center. 
I wondered if you needed anything

80
00:09:58,137 --> 00:09:59,202
Oh, I've let her in on it

81
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:04,100
You needn't tell a stretcher how it is you come to appear

82
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:06,782
You told?

83
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:10,361
Asked for unguent by secret thinking for 
the beating she was giving my hand

84
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:14,703
That's my purpose in the center. 
Stopped to ask if you needed aught else

85
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,782
If I did, I believe you'd already know

86
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:22,773
Hit her a good one for me

87
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:23,912
I will

88
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:32,640
Come in!

89
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:38,181
I  was looking for Mr. Hearst

90
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,120
Who do you think you're talkin' to?

91
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:46,773
Candidly, of late, I'm at pains to be certain 
which voices are within me and which without

92
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,492
This one is without, telling you to come in

93
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:50,641
Of course

94
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:02,182
What is it, Mr. Hearst? 
I've sensed for some while we owed each other a talk

95
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:07,683
Let the outcome be grim or worse, 
I'll at least be relieved that it's past

96
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,781
May I look at the addressee?

97
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:26,333
How will you know to whom 
it is to be delivered if you do not?

98
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,093
Oh dear

99
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:34,192
Well, I'll be on my way then

100
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,673
Must have shook 100 hands in Sturgis

101
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:56,262
When you declared for Sheriff, Harry, I feared you'd be 
a poor campaigner and derelict in your duties here

102
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,320
You've held your end up
and more

103
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:02,272
Ache in my hand and wrist,
the deep-set dirt defies me

104
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:07,790
Well, if sweeping, you don't raise your usual simoon, 
it's a paltry price to pay

105
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:10,271
Fuck if you saw that comin'

106
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:12,352
I have something to show you, Harry

107
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:27,550
The Finster Model 60 steam pumper fire wagon

108
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,260
120-gallon boiler?

109
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:31,680
Three brass nozzles

110
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,231
Nickel-finished firebox?

111
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,283
I believe that to be the case

112
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,353
Did the hats come?

113
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,791
Is that a checker in Steve's mouth?

114
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:51,792
You don't want to look after him, just say so

115
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:52,963
Who says I don't?

116
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:55,780
Only he kibitzes my moves

117
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:57,762
Where are you goin'?

118
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,433
Takin' him to vote for Bullock

119
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,190
This may require my supervision

120
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:03,871
I'll vote just before lunch

121
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,961
And  I'll go once you've relieved me

122
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:15,183
You don't expect me to believe you didn't 
steam this open

123
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,333
and reseal it for me to open again

124
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:18,980
I didn't wanna know

125
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,691
This motherfucker!

126
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,380
For my complicity in his shooting, he orders my death

127
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:31,512
You did read it

128
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:35,642
Be quick then, please

129
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:39,030
Your complicity's mostly in your noggin, E.B

130
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:40,671
It's the whore he wants dead

131
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:49,451
By what vile method then? 
Is Trixie to be drawn and quartered and set aflame?

132
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:51,771
Say he'll have my answer in an hour

133
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:52,723
Al

134
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:53,410
E.B

135
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,062
I can't, Al

136
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:56,722
I can't engage him in further conversation

137
00:13:56,947 --> 00:14:00,052
When I hear his voice, I see the inside of his skull!

138
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:03,802
Phantoms grin out at me, oozing gruesome goo

139
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:06,141
Slide this under his door then

140
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:08,741
Would you rather I tell him?

141
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,241
Only decide quickly

142
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,761
Fear is every man's portion

143
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:37,882
Did he send for you, Joanie?

144
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:39,231
What's happenin' here, Con?

145
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,164
Well, not knowin' Mr. Tolliver's, uh, 
present state of feelin' towards you is why I ask

146
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:47,129
Then why don't you stay the fuck out of it, Con?

147
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:52,063
I wasn't fuckin' dreamin'.
It is Joanie Stubbs

148
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,830
I got "Stay the fuck out" written on 
a stone tablet in my bedroom

149
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:00,951
How you feelin', Cy?

150
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,381
I get around all right

151
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:03,991
Your color's better

152
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:07,463
Is that a fucking fact? 
My color's better, Stupid

153
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:11,833
Stupid, this is Joanie Stubbs

154
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:13,043
Hi

155
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:14,601
What's your name, Honey?

156
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,463
Go ahead and tell her your name

157
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:19,870
Janine

158
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:20,742
Hi, Janine

159
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:21,480
Hi

160
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:26,860
Go ahead now, Jan-nee-nee-neen, 
and finish your Latin lessons and your Greek

161
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:31,653
The thirst this girl has for knowledge, 
she's barely time to suck a prick

162
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,280
She's pretty

163
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:39,833
What the fuck do you want?

164
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:44,721
I've been thinking about you is all

165
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,871
Help me understand cunt, Lord

166
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:55,062
Saying the other night you oughtn't come inside 
that school, Cy, don't feel I don't wish you well

167
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,602
Buy some lines in the paper, Joanie.
Let the public know

168
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:00,673
I know you meant that for me in your way

169
00:16:01,038 --> 00:16:01,883
What?

170
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:03,603
Meant me well

171
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:07,732
If it's Christmas, where's the fucking snow, 
or the fucking harp music or the like?

172
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:12,163
If it wasn't for you, I'd have died a long long time ago

173
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:19,211
Some happiness has come into my life now, 
and I'm grateful I didn't

174
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,473
My lines are women, liquor 
and rigged games of chance.

175
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,002
Are you playing?

176
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,911
What do you think of all this trouble Hearst brought?

177
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,993
Does a girl have to drive cattle
for you to eat her pussy?

178
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:46,283
You voting, Leon?

179
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,750
Against the opium ordinance

180
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:02,563
What the fuck are you looking at?

181
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:07,073
That whore's gotta die

182
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:09,532
Jen?

183
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,380
Hearst won't stand for an empty coffin

184
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:19,711
Likely, he paid most attention to Trixie's tits and snatch, 
so Jen'll adequately pass

185
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:23,942
Jesus Christ

186
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:25,753
I know. You like her

187
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,231
She's a nice girl

188
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:28,671
All right

189
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,513
She's learning to read

190
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:36,733
Spend some time with her, and let me know when you're done

191
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,420
You'll scare her

192
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,813
I've done it once or twice, Johnny

193
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,642
She won't know that's what I'm there for

194
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:47,942
She won't need to.
You scare her no matter what

195
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:58,492
Oh, just give me a fucking knife then.
Just give me the fucking knife

196
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:10,803
Fucking  Trixie!

197
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,132
Don't get me started

198
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:28,420
What are you doing?

199
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:30,402
Going for a stroll to the polls

200
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,653
One vote for Star buys a hand job

201
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:33,971
Repeaters get a suck

202
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:34,600
Trixie

203
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:38,111
I'm through staying inside. 
If something's to happen let it happen to me

204
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:40,091
You  selfish cunt!

205
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:41,871
No one asked you to put me up

206
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:43,240
That's right. That's right

207
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,283
My fucking choice! I'm not fucking afraid

208
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:47,912
I guess maybe I'm not either

209
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:48,760
Not to die

210
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,593
Well, ain't you clever?

211
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:54,102
Ain't you fucking clever, you deep thinkin' fuckin' Jew!

212
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,603
Sol : Why bother with your boots then, Trixie, 
if you're going to be on your knees?
Trixie : Let go of me!

213
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:57,362
No!

214
00:18:57,548 --> 00:18:58,743
Let me walk out by myself !

215
00:18:58,956 --> 00:18:59,641
The fuck if I will!

216
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:03,050
At least I can say I threw you out 
if you'd rather die than live with me!

217
00:19:58,466 --> 00:20:01,143
Use just half till you see how you stand it

218
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:02,633
It itches bad

219
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,602
I'm saying use just half till you see

220
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:14,022
I wanna talk with you

221
00:20:16,728 --> 00:20:18,503
No, I mean it, Jen. I wanna talk

222
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:23,480
Pure conversation

223
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,573
Nothing for you to be alarmed about

224
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:34,752
Four and five deep to vote, Boss

225
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:40,190
Eyes up or predominantly down when Hearst's goons
glare upon 'em?

226
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:43,170
Uh, I want to go check again

227
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:44,412
Good. Good.

228
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,272
Never opine short of certainty

229
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:49,783
What is this, Jen?

230
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:53,232
A wall?

231
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:58,041
On the surface, yes, it is

232
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:06,461
But inside, many creatures go about their lives, 
such as ants

233
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:11,582
They got a whole operation going

234
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:18,651
They got soldier ants and worker ants and whore ants 
to fuck the soldiers and the workers,

235
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:21,430
right inside that wall, baby ants

236
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,701
Everyone's got a task to hew to, Jen

237
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:29,832
You understand me?

238
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,962
Jesus Christ's fucking sake

239
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,712
We'll talk about this later

240
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:48,562
I can't

241
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:49,850
Give it to me then

242
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:51,603
No

243
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,933
Give me the fucking knife

244
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:57,682
She ain't stole or been quarrelsome
or set the bedding afire

245
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,122
Get out of my fucking way, Johnny

246
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,192
It ain't fair to fucking kill her

247
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:04,451
Since when did that begin entering in?

248
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:07,893
I won't let you pass, Boss

249
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:09,140
Johnny

250
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:13,123
I won't. 
I won't let you

251
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:19,763
You're willing to die in her stead?

252
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:21,972
If I got to…

253
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:26,830
preferring you'd handle things different

254
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,951
Make sure the whore don't leave.
Let Johnny cool down, then knock him the fuck out

255
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:42,943
What's gonna happen?

256
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:51,570
What's gonna happen is I'm gonna go look and see if, perchance, 
I mightn't be the owner of another fucking knife

257
00:22:58,676 --> 00:22:59,982
Richardson!

258
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:03,862
I can't remember

259
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,221
Come here.
Give it to me

260
00:23:08,077 --> 00:23:10,783
I don't suppose you gonna go vote 
stocking-footed

261
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:12,723
I  forgot

262
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:14,040
Ain't those them?

263
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:20,570
You gonna vote for Mr. Bullock now

264
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:25,693
Even though he beat Mr. Farnum, 
'cause he took you-know-who by his ear

265
00:23:25,976 --> 00:23:28,043
Like some others ain't brave enough to do

266
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:32,611
Anyways, Harry Manning gives me splinters

267
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:34,361
How's he do that, child?

268
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:36,981
Raising the windows after he's ate

269
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:40,760
Richardson…Richardson, you're right about that

270
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:46,700
South had that man's gas to load in their cannons, shoot, 
wouldn't be no free niggers nowhere

271
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:49,040
Noah hisself would have throwed him out the boat

272
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:54,733
Now that's for us talking now

273
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:57,811
Don't you be saying what I say to you outside these rooms

274
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:03,112
First you back, you're gonna clean your mess up, Richardson.
You hear me?

275
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,001
Yes, Ma'am

276
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:07,912
Okay. Go on on. 
You look fine

277
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:09,181
Thank you

278
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:16,043
Remember who gave it to you, boys.
Vote democratic

279
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,543
Look what broke out their cage-a monkey

280
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,570
Right to vote shall not be abridged or denied…

281
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:33,180
on account of race or color or 
condition of previous servitude

282
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:40,772
15th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified 1870, 
law of the land thereafter, including territories

283
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,661
They got something about niggers not waiting their turn?

284
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,120
Not that I'm aware of

285
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:45,702
Oh, you ain't aware of it

286
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:48,330
Then I guess you'll want this white man voting first

287
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:50,132
What's a few minutes more?

288
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,442
The nigger was before him

289
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,300
Yes

290
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:53,932
No he wasn't

291
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:55,652
I guess you're blind and stupid

292
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,123
I believe I'll vote later

293
00:24:57,418 --> 00:24:59,650
Fuck if you will. 
Get your nigger ass back in line

294
00:25:00,896 --> 00:25:03,131
You'd better be walking him home afterwards

295
00:25:03,855 --> 00:25:06,450
You'd better see to that yourself, 
'cause if he don't make it,

296
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,921
you'll be eating your spuds running 
till I hunt you the fuck down

297
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:11,620
And that ends that

298
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:13,813
What your shit-stirring started

299
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:17,062
Will you drop your fucking ballot?

300
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:22,070
Ain't it wonderful, Steve?

301
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:25,152
Sorry for all the commotion, Miss Stubbs

302
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:26,590
That's all right, Mr. Utter

303
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:31,442
Uh, I got something at the jail for you and the other one

304
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:35,031
'Cept right now I'm pretty agitated

305
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:36,762
Well, I got time

306
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:39,380
Maybe you'll calm down as we walk

307
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:41,443
All right

308
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:53,482
How do you make your way, Star, not sometimes buying silence
by punching her in the fucking mouth?

309
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,662
She thinks Hearst is going to want her dead

310
00:25:55,895 --> 00:25:58,111
She thinks you'll kill one of these others

311
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,101
Oh, Jesus Christ

312
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:02,852
Al :Jesus Christ
Sol : Is it true?

313
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,720
I already fucking did

314
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,083
Is that true?

315
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:09,660
Don't waste your Jew's time wondering 
what's true and what ain't

316
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:13,710
You go over there, tell fucking Hearst 
the whore Trixie has been killed,

317
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:17,573
and then tell Joan of Arc that 
instead of flames lapping at her tippy-toes,

318
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,571
you'd have her live to fuck in the morning

319
00:26:20,027 --> 00:26:23,151
And after to you tell fucking Hearst, 
before you tell that loudmouth cunt,

320
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:25,402
tell your fucking partner I need him here

321
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:26,610
Don't talk about her that way

322
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,913
Oh, I fucking recant.
Off you fucking go.

323
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:32,693
And don't neglect fucking Bullock. 
Water comes to a boil

324
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,212
Unlucky fucking mutt

325
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:41,342
You remember Hawkeye

326
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:42,801
How many has he got?

327
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:46,053
Ride from Cheyenne winnowed the wheat from the chaff

328
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:47,840
How many, Adams, of the promised 23?

329
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:52,863
Almost 18, Mr. Swearengen, camped in Spearfish Meadows, 
ready to join in the issue

330
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:55,461
What does he mean by "Almost 18?"

331
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:58,391
17 normal size and a short one that's hell with a knife

332
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:00,931
Turn me loose

333
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:03,003
Ain't that Mr. Wu?

334
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:05,090
In there, Wu

335
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:09,170
Go with him to get the men, station in Cochran's Alley

336
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:12,073
Send word you're positioned with the midget

337
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,200
That went off well

338
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:26,270
Hello, hello

339
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:28,121
What  happened, Jane?

340
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:30,000
Nothing out of the ordinary

341
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:37,153
The bank lady took her child to Ellsworth's grave 
and I got drunk

342
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:39,211
How long you been here?

343
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:42,491
Many years.
Or is it a day or two?

344
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:46,523
What's important is you get to keep asking me questions 
so I don't get to ask you one

345
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:47,792
Go ahead

346
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:55,451
Why in fuck, with me asking you in to play hot hands with me and Sofia, 
you stood there instead looking like you just did murder?

347
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:58,041
Well, you didn't.
I'd come in if you'd asked

348
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,240
Bullshit!

349
00:27:59,697 --> 00:28:03,410
How can you say we've been sending secret thought 
messages and pretend you didn't know?

350
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:05,641
Well, anyways

351
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:06,733
Anyways, what?

352
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:11,070
Anyways, I've just finished my business at the center

353
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:13,023
Who gives a fuck?

354
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:18,812
I saw you, and then I went to the Bella Union, 
and I talked to Cy real quick, and then I went and saw the voting-

355
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:21,353
Is that so? 
Oh, so did you go see Cy real quick?

356
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:25,752
Did you pay a quick call on Cy? 
Did they stick some quick pricks in you?

357
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:26,921
It wasn't like that, Jane

358
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:28,903
Who gives a fuck? 
Not me

359
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:39,642
I saw at the voting what I guess you knowed about 
Mr. Utter all these years, and Mr. Hickok musta knowed

360
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:44,020
What he's like in a tight-one he didn't even need to be in

361
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:46,580
Yeah, he's okay in those

362
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:49,413
I want to be that to you

363
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:52,592
Even when we don't get along

364
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:57,083
You got that part down perfect, me and him

365
00:28:57,495 --> 00:28:59,082
What, the "don't get along"?

366
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:01,610
Of course we had years of practice

367
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:10,263
He sent us this

368
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:17,220
That's Bill Hickok's robe you got there, 
that's whose that is

369
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:27,412
Warm

370
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:37,692
I, in no way, wish to impugn his veracity, but 
I would have Mr. Swearengen understand that for her try on my life,

371
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:41,410
I ought to see that the whore has paid with her own

372
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:42,920
All right

373
00:29:43,218 --> 00:29:45,390
Wherever the viewing will impose least

374
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:46,282
You'll go there?

375
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:47,373
Of course

376
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,252
I feel very safe in this camp

377
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:54,102
This fucking place is gonna be a fucking misery

378
00:29:54,726 --> 00:30:01,351
Every fucking one of them, every fucking time I walk by, 
"Ooh, how could you?  How could you?"  With their big fucking cow eyes

379
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:06,283
The entire fucking gaggle of 'em is gonna 
have to bleed and quit before we can even hope for peace

380
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:07,952
What's the fucking alternative?

381
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:15,353
I ain't fuckin' killing her that sat nights with me sick and 
taking slaps to her mug that were some less than fucking fair

382
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:19,672
I should have fucking learned to use a gun, 
but I'm too fucking entrenched in my ways

383
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:25,182
And you ain't exactly the one to be leveling criticisms 
on the score of being slow to adapt

384
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:29,142
You fucking people are the original slow fucking learners!

385
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:46,082
How was she, pal?

386
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,782
Good, wonderful

387
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:51,460
I don't mind a small pair of tits

388
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:54,241
You sure you're done?

389
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,490
You look the sort could turn right around 
and drop the hammer again

390
00:30:58,355 --> 00:30:59,411
I will if it's free

391
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,021
See you later, Pal

392
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:09,622
C'mere

393
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:34,993
Did it seem like Hearst ordered the interference?

394
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:35,920
Huh-uh

395
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:39,070
Being stupid on his own, that strong-arm was

396
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,732
Or if you want, I could say "Yes."

397
00:31:44,188 --> 00:31:45,273
Tea, Mr. Utter?

398
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,311
Tea got kick to it too, a little, don't it?

399
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:50,412
Would you rather coffee?

400
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:51,982
Oh, no no no

401
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,512
I ought to get familiar with tea

402
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:07,640
Uh, Much free liquor as them Pinkertons poured against you, 
Sheriff, it seemed like strong support for you and Star

403
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:10,392
My election's countywide, Charlie

404
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:14,621
That's what's fucking worrisome, fucking countywide aspect

405
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:18,771
Mr. Star

406
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:20,872
I'm sorry for barging in, uh

407
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:22,040
What is it, Sol?

408
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:25,941
Uh, everything

409
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,161
Mr. Langrishe

410
00:32:29,585 --> 00:32:32,313
Making bold to ask after your health, Sir

411
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:33,911
I was shot in the shoulder

412
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,382
So one understood

413
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,403
But the wound seems healing clean

414
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:39,483
And your back, Sir?

415
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:44,830
Oh, deprived of your Turkish artillery treatments, 
my back is as it was

416
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:48,693
Please blame my dereliction
on the demands of readying our theater

417
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:54,132
I had been blaming your choosing old friends 
over new acquaintances

418
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:55,101
Please, sit down

419
00:32:55,567 --> 00:33:02,652
One prays always, Sir, as one's store is depleted by time, 
new acquaintances may become one's friends

420
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:09,101
As your friend, I ask if you believe that fate has not chosen 
for your encounter with your deepest destiny

421
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:16,741
the place where you now find yourself, while decreeing for some-
my friend Swearengen included-quite otherwise?

422
00:33:17,027 --> 00:33:22,022
Your proposition is that this place at this hour 
will show all of Mr. Swearengen?

423
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:22,782
Yes

424
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:25,000
And Mr. Bullock, who took me by the ear?

425
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:30,691
I only hazard my impression that, 
less possessing his character than possessed by it,

426
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:34,481
he is also someone for whom the outcome must be soon

427
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:47,221
Whilst imagining for you, Mr. Hearst, the earth entertaining 
some larger purpose to be told you elsewhere and at another time

428
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:57,782
Why do you say so? In those words, I mean-"The earth speaks"?

429
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:05,181
A vestige of childhood tales in which not only humans spoke, 
but other creatures too

430
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,392
Mountains and streams

431
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:15,671
I imagine she speaks to me still, the earth, 
what's inside her, how to get it out

432
00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:21,931
Comprehending such a language can cost a man 
his own kind's sympathies

433
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:26,740
Arguing perhaps for a more solitary life

434
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:28,321
Sad anointing

435
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:35,103
The mountain I must go up on, Mr. Langrishe, 
I have ascended before

436
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:41,723
It's in Montana, and I came down it with silver, 
suspecting there was copper too, and now I'm told that's true

437
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:44,150
Do I understand you to say you're leaving us?

438
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,331
For the Anaconda, yes

439
00:34:46,725 --> 00:34:54,711
But first, I'll have the election returns, and then one last visit 
with your friend to see the cunt who shot me dead

440
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:55,833
Good day, Sir

441
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:12,373
Box her in my office

442
00:35:13,836 --> 00:35:15,621
Send Jewel up to clean up the mess?

443
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:20,170
If I'm having her boxed in my fucking office, 
don't I want the blood left for the cocksucker to see?

444
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:25,200
And when that's over, if we're still alive, 
I'll clean my own fucking mess up

445
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:29,542
Look in on Johnny, see if he's grown the fuck up

446
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:34,882
Sturgis is a landslide
for Harry Manning

447
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:38,651
970 votes for Harry Manning, 68 votes for Mr. Bullock

448
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,651
Heavy turnout among the bivouacked military

449
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,743
"Within the hour," Hearst said 20 minutes or so ago

450
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:52,463
Didn't you tell him?

451
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:54,030
I have not as yet, no

452
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:59,230
How do you think you might enjoy private life?

453
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:03,320
Sturgis?

454
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:08,430
970 votes for Harry Manning, 68 votes for Mr. Bullock

455
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:33,563
Put her in?

456
00:36:34,306 --> 00:36:37,560
Don't I want to put my dress on her first, 
you fucking moron?

457
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:42,410
I'm sent to check on Johnny. 
I'll come back and put her in

458
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:54,910
She's, uh, putting Jen in her dress

459
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:57,401
Johnny

460
00:36:59,598 --> 00:37:01,092
Then I'll do the boxing

461
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:09,992
We show united in the prelude when he's making 
his entrance and the fucking like

462
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:13,450
Comes to viewing the body, I stand for virtue alone

463
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:17,822
The deception failing, I'll make a pass
at him with my blade

464
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:24,812
In the aftermath, play the lie as mine, 
knowing I speak of you in heaven

465
00:37:28,977 --> 00:37:34,500
Others owe thought to the future-their thinking 
straightforward don't come that naturally to

466
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:40,113
Fuck you, Dan! Fuck you!

467
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,501
You got my condolences

468
00:37:44,705 --> 00:37:48,652
As sorrowful as the passing of Jen is, 
you know that Al, he didn't have no choice

469
00:37:48,587 --> 00:37:49,471
Bullshit

470
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:53,120
Feeling how he feels about Trixie, is what I'm saying

471
00:37:53,615 --> 00:37:55,301
Come on, Johnny, you side with your feelings

472
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:58,322
Right or wrong, you side with your feelings

473
00:38:00,317 --> 00:38:03,531
Now can you come to yourself in time 
to be of some fucking use?

474
00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:14,822
You don't chew your cabbage twice, do you, Mr. Newman?

475
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:23,061
I guess I don't have to set big blocks of time aside for 
this future collaboration between us that Mr. Hearst outlines here

476
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:25,473
You don't want to crack too fucking wise

477
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:31,431
I don't want to be talking to you at all, Mr. Newman, 
but that seems to be the way the hand lays

478
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:33,891
I tell him you agree?

479
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:40,442
Yeah, you tell him I agree, 
and I appreciate the chance at a new friendship

480
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:50,092
A few nails in the box, Dan, would do me for pretext

481
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:28,813
All but sucked your prick, 
you'd have me be your fucking quartermaster

482
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,013
The rising tide of fucking chinks, Janine?

483
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:44,583
The ragtag collection by the hardware store: 
I'd put in Swearengen's camp

484
00:39:50,147 --> 00:39:51,993
Good dope today, am I right, Leon?

485
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:57,610
Last two or three days have been good

486
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,712
You are a fucking beauty, Leon

487
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:05,052
Lifts me up to be with you

488
00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:08,032
Jesus!

489
00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:16,891
What the fuck did you do to me, Sir?

490
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,343
I believe I fucking stabbed you

491
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:34,512
Gentlemen

492
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:38,483
Any word yet on how the other camps have voted?

493
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:46,291
Is it as Sheriff, Mr. Bullock, you divide us?

494
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,412
Need anyone divide us inside?

495
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:50,770
Are you sure you still hold office?

496
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:55,781
If I'm beat, it owes to Yankton's whore 
buying cavalry repeaters in Sturgis

497
00:40:56,138 --> 00:41:03,812
Why, Sir, then you must protest; camp in Yankton; 
protest and demand justice; grab the legislators by their ears

498
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,771
Ain't you hear to confirm a croaker?

499
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:08,403
In here?

500
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:20,712
Mr. Newman and so many of his cohorts 
as he deems appropriate will precede us

501
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,341
You don't mind if I go in alone?

502
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:23,452
Not at all, Sir

503
00:41:37,107 --> 00:41:45,342
Hearst moves his operating headquarters to Lead, 
I get to see to all his other-than-mining interests here in the camp

504
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:47,282
Congratulations, Sir

505
00:41:48,097 --> 00:41:49,170
Thank you, Leon

506
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:54,323
If those are your last words here on earth, 
you tell the Lord you went out stupid

507
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:56,651
He's dead

508
00:41:56,986 --> 00:41:57,870
Oh, not yet, honey

509
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:01,423
See how the blood still pumps a little out his leg?

510
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:04,541
When they're dead, that turns to seep

511
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:10,812
Do you believe I will leave without seeing?

512
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,922
Well, I was hesitant to presume

513
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:40,130
What do you want done with that body?

514
00:43:41,075 --> 00:43:42,782
It's Mr. Swearengen's affair now

515
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:47,862
The body at my fucking freight office, 
what you want down with that one?

516
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:49,880
You'll be wired instructions

517
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,290
Has she family ought be notified?

518
00:43:57,077 --> 00:43:59,193
I don't notify fucking family

519
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:01,810
I guess especially not hers

520
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:14,623
She has a sister, whores in Gunnison

521
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:19,291
Jen's sister, you could write to, care of the Yellowbird

522
00:44:28,717 --> 00:44:30,693
I'd take that fucking scrub brush

523
00:44:37,917 --> 00:44:45,103
I wonder if, the other day, you took my not publishing 
the news that you'd been shot for a failure to observe,

524
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:50,730
or lay it correctly to a judgment on my part 
that suppressing the news would better serve the camp

525
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:53,223
I've stopped reading your paper, Merrick

526
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,750
I'll have my people here start another one-
to lie the other way

527
00:44:59,195 --> 00:44:59,663
Hop down

528
00:45:00,017 --> 00:45:01,542
I'd like to take a last look around

529
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:11,850
If I'm quick enough about this, Janine, 
maybe me and Mr. Hearst will get to hear the Lord judge Leon

530
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,442
You want to get a listen too?

531
00:45:30,718 --> 00:45:31,411
Huh?

532
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:35,591
No, Charlie

533
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:40,740
Yes, Mr. Bullock?

534
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,471
You've looked at your last body

535
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:44,780
You're done tipping your fucking hat

536
00:45:45,198 --> 00:45:48,113
Get out of here or I'll drag you out by the ear

537
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:57,460
Oh, Please.
Please don't

538
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:04,703
Drive on

539
00:46:19,636 --> 00:46:21,812
Tell fucking Con to take care of that asshole

540
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:45,863
You done fucking good

541
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:47,642
I did fucking nothing

542
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:54,810
That's often a tough one, in aid of the larger purpose

543
00:46:55,336 --> 00:46:58,891
Which is laying head to pillow,
not confusing yourself with a sucker?

544
00:47:00,288 --> 00:47:01,561
Far as I ever get

545
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,402
'Cause that's gonna be a project tonight

546
00:47:59,768 --> 00:48:00,660
Did she suffer?

547
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:06,633
I was gentle as I was able, 
and that's the last we'll fucking speak of it, Johnny

548
00:48:13,118 --> 00:48:14,963
Wants me to tell him something pretty

549
00:48:21,617 --> 00:48:24,651
[ The end? Let's hope it's a "to be continued" ] :)
