# For to ride the range you love

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,069
# Across the wide prairie

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,198

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,237
# Lay down your gun

(Horse whinnies)

19
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,236
(Texan drawl) I wonder what they wanted.

20
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,196
What the...? Ah, business.

21
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,038
Take good care of 'em, mister.
They were good friends of mine.

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,031
It'll be a pleasure, sir.

23
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,072
What do you want?
Plain coffin, one dollar. Padded, two dollars.

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,194
Maybe you'd like pillows,
beautiful silver handles? All the trimmings.

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,988
- But...that'll be an extra two dollars.
- Give 'em pads...

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,109
- Pads.
- ..pillows...

27
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,189
- Pillows.
- ..handles...

28
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,037
Handles.

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,076
- And some flowers.
- Flowers?

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,236
Pansies.

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,156
Hold it a minute, Russ.

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,237
- What's the matter, Judge?
- I thought I heard shots just now.

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,198
Nah. It's probably just a horse backfiring.

34
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,151
Oh, yes.

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,073
Hey, wait a minute.
I know a horse backfiring when I hear one.

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,033
Come now, Judge,
there ain't been no shootin' in Stodge

37
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,038
since the day you ran Jessie James out of town.

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,150
- What a day that was, eh?
- Hey-hey.

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,156
You know, Judge, I never credited you

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,072
with either the guts or the courage
to do a thing like that.

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,238
Oh, I don't know. I didn't like having
to get tough with Jessie, though.

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,993
She was a nice girl.

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,237
I never did get to know
exactly what she done that was so wrong?

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,155
Old Ben was a friend of mine, Sam,
and she killed him.

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,159
It was his own fault. He was 92.
I warned him not to marry her.

46
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,151
(Laughter)

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,072
How she did it was immaterial.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,159
Come on. Let's get back to the game.
It's your draw, Judge.

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,031
Someone's dropped one.

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,150
Eh?
- Oh, it's me .

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,071
I've got it.

52
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,039
Mrs Bun, the Baker. Happy Families.

53
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,038
That's another pot I've won.

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,152
Heh-heh. Oh, and mighty purty it is too.

55
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,196
That one's gonna take a lot of timber.

56
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,072
Six and seven-eighths. Business is picking up.

57
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,119
Yup, I reckon we've come far enough, old pal.
Time to rest up.

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,231
Howdy, stranger!

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,196
- <i>Nice day</i>.
- (Spittoon dings)

60
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,196
Disgusting.

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,199
Remind me to put up a notice about that -
"No Spitting".

62
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,031
Yeah. Yeah, sure, Judge.

63
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,071
PIANO: # My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,078
What'll it be?
Lemonade, ginger beer, sarsaparilla?

65
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,195
Don't be funny. Whisky.

66
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,028
We're don't serve hard stuff in Stodge, sir.
Mayor's orders.

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,995
That is correct. But I can thoroughly
recommend the ginger beer.

68
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,031
Don't you talk to me about ginger beer.

69
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,992
- Who is this?
- Judge Burke.

70
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,189
I am the Mayor.

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,192
Better keep away from my horse.
He ain't seen a mare in three weeks.

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,159
- Come on. Whisky.
- Certainly not. We are fully temperance.

73
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,119
I don't care if you're full of flatulence.
I've been on the trail six days non-stop.

74
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,071
I can't help that.

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,033
- I don't like people who get in my way.
- I can't help that.

76
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,031
And I just shot three men who did.

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,157
I... Oh, well, in that case,
perhaps just a little one.

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,193
They keep a bottle or two for me -
for purely medicinal purposes, of course.

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,153
- Leave the bottle.
- Oh, I say, I can't have that.

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,149
(Piano stops)

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,195

(Growls)

85
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,072
- I'll just take that gun of yours, cowboy.
- What for?

86
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,036
I don't allow no shootin' at my place.

87
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,150
Lady, I wouldn't dream of shootin' at your place.

88
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,116
I'm not afraid to use this, you know.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,115
My, but you've got a big one.

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,993
I'm from Texas, ma'am.
We all got big ones down there.

91
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,109
And the other. Hand it over.

92
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,116
I'll take those, Belle.

93
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,156
Check them, will you, Charlie?

94
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,990
Thank you. Here's your ticket. You can have
them back when you're ready to leave.

95
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,189
I ain't leaving for a while.

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,994
Oh, that's nice.
We could do with a bit of fun round here.

97
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,238
- So you're Belle?
- My intimate friends call me...Ding Dong.

98
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,151
Like to give you a clang some time.

99
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,196
How about letting me have a couple of rooms?

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,078
$10 a day...all in. OK?

101
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,238
Oh, no. I'm sorry, Belle,
I can't have him staying in Stodge City.

102
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,038
<i>Now, listen here, my good man</i>.

103
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,119
I run this town
and I can't have any trouble around here.

104
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,998
- You won't have to worry about that.
- I won't?

105
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,189
From now on, I'll be running it.

106
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,997
Yes...

107
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,155
Come on. I'll show you your rooms.

108
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,192
- Do you mind putting that away first?
- Oh, why, sure.

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,117
Wow. What a holster.

110
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,076
Disgusting.

111
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,037
I'm gonna get the Sheriff.

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,033
How about that ? Three all at once.
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus?

113
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,152
It's a disgrace.
What's the use of me putting these notices up?

114
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,228
Where's the Sheriff? What's he doing?
Earp! Earp! Sheriff!

115
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,991
Sheriff!

116
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,189
Oh, there you are, Earp.

117
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,191
Wake up. There's been a shooting.

118
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,153
It's all right. It's all right.
Don't go mad. It's only me - Judge Burke.

119
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,158
Now, listen, there's been a shooting.

120
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,232
- What's that?
- I say, there's been a shoo...

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,116
Oh, for heaven's sake, where's your thing?

122
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,191
There's been a shootin'!

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,028
- Yeah?
- And there's three men laying dead out there.

124
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,998
- Strange. I didn't hear nothin'.
- I'm not surprised.

125
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,031
You never have your thing in.

126
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,071
It's my afternoon off, Judge.

127
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,192
I don't know what we pay you for, really I don't.

128
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,079
- Who done it? Do you know?
- Some terrible-looking rough.

129
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,156
He's over in Belle's place now.

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,159
You've got to run him out of town.
I don't want that kind of person here.

131
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,112
It lowers the tone of the whole neighbourhood.

132
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,076
Well, don't you worry none, Judge.

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,079
We'll have him out of here in an hour,
either head first or feet first.

134
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,189
- Yeah.
- That's right.

135
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,156
In my position, as Mayor...

136
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,193
For heaven's sakes, where are your spectacles?

137
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,152
- What do you say?
- Your spectacles!

138
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,033
Er...around here someplace.

139
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,991
Oh, here they are.

140
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,076
- Where?
- Here they are!

141
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,151
Ah! Here they are!

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,033
Heh heh heh! Yeah!

143
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,229
Yeah. That's better.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,115
Well, here we go.

145
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,233
Oh! Here. There. That way. Ohhh.

146
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,113
Wait a minute. Here.
For Pete's sake. Now, there.

147
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,072
Yeah, well, thanks, Judge.

148
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,197
These specs ain't so good
for seeing things a long ways off.

149
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,149
He'll have to go.

150
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,116
Yahoo!

151
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,118
Forward ho!

152
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,037
Whoa!

153
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,071
Nice going, Lightning.

154
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,192
All right, get away from that bar, stranger.
And don't try nothin'.

155
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,196
It's me, Sheriff- Charlie.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,112
- Huh?
- Charlie!

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,153
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Charlie.
Didn't recognise you from the front.

158
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,994
- Where's the killer?
- Up with Belle, Sheriff. Room 12.

159
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,189
- Room 12.
- Yup.

160
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,196
Yeah. Well, thanks.

161
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,031
You have a good sleep, sweetheart.

162
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,998
(Lightning whinnies)
- See you later.

163
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,118
I reckon you Texans think more of horses
than you do of us women.

164
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,232
Naturally. If I was being chased by a posse,
I wouldn't get very far on you.

165
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,152
If you were raising a family,
you wouldn't get far on a horse.

167
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,073
You got five seconds to come out
with your hands up or I'm coming in to get you!

168
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,189
Who's that?

169
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,156
That's Albert. Albert Earp, our Sheriff.

170
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,236
EARP: <i>Are you comin' out?</i>
- Nope.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,069
EARP: <i>Then I'm comin' in</i>.

172
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,999
(Crashing and clattering)

173
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,189
EARP: <i>Where's the door?</i>

174
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,072
All right, get out of that bed,
get on your horse and get out of Stodge.

175
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,076
That <i>is</i> his horse, Sheriff.

176
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,195
These dang glasses.

177
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,152
I'm better off without 'em. That's better.

178
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,233
There's liable to be some fancy shooting around
here, Miss Belle. You'd better get the hell out.

179
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,994
You'd better put them specs on.
I'm the fella you're looking for.

180
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,110
- What was that?
- (Mouths)

181
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,236
I'm the fella you're looking for!

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,149
That's the game, is it?

183
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,113
Well, it takes more than dressing up
in women's clothes to fool me, mister.

184
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,156
On your way, cowboy... Cowboy?

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,156
I've had enough of this.

186
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,077
Look here, Twerp...

187
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,072
Name's Earp. Albert Earp, without the "tw".

188
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,992
With or without, what's the matter?
What have I done wrong?

189
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,157
- You've killed three men, mister.
- I know that, but what have I done wrong?

190
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,151
You wanna try drawin' on me, mister?

191
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,993
I can't. I ain't got my guns.

192
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,235
I'll give you five seconds to find one.

193
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,071
One...

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,194
..two...

195
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,071
..three...

196
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,111
- Where are they?
- ..five.

197
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,116
(Gunshot)

198
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,150
Sheriff! Sheriff!

199
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,237
Here. Are...are you all right?

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,070
I...reckon I'm going, Judge.

201
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,076
Oh, don't go.

202
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,190
Listen...listen, friend.

203
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,152
Just tell my folks what happened, will you?

204
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,151
They'll even the score.

205
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,196
Will you do that for me, friend?

206
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,151
Yes, of course.

207
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,078
- What's that?
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

208
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,157
Here. Yes! Of course!

209
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,237
There's...there's no need to shout, Judge.

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,198
I'm...I'm wearing my specs.

211
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,116
It's I lucky I remembered where you put that.

212
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,230
Oh...I do beg your pardon, Commissioner.

213
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,198
Damn it, Perkins, can't you see I'm busy!

214
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,073
I'm terribly sorry, sir. This just wouldn't wait.

215
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,991
Ahem. You think <i>this</i> will?

216
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,157
All right, all right. What's so all-fired important?

217
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,236
It's another telegraph from Stodge City, sir.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,070
Judge Burke - he's the Mayor there, you know.

219
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,069
Burke? Oh, yeah, I remember him
in Law School. He's a bum.

220
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,071
I didn't know you studied at Law School, sir?

221
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,237
I didn't. I was the janitor.
What does the bum want?

222
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,118
Lawless elements
have completely taken over the town.

223
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,197
He wants us to send him a Peace Marshal
to clean the place up.

224
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,199
Why bother me with all this?
Send him a Marshal. Anything for peace.

225
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,198
Well, that's just the trouble, sir.
We haven't any available.

226
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,077
Nobody?

227
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,157
What about that bighead who hangs around,
looking for work?

228
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,237
Er what's his name? Dillon.
What's he doing?

229
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,069
Six months.

230
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,033
Oh. Well, looks like we got a problem here.

231
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,150
Miss Jones,
can you think of something we can do?

232
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,071
Why, yes.

233
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,992
But hadn't we better get the problem
out of the way first?

234
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,037
Next.

235
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,033
- What can I do for you?
- I'd like a job, please.

236
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,996
- Name?
- Knutt.

237
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,996
Er with a "K".

238
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,996
Huh, you could have fooled me.

239
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,109
First name?

240
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,038
Marshall. Marshall P Knutt.

241
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,071
Most of my friends call me "Marsh".

242
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,157
Well, then, in that case,
you won't mind if I call you Marshall.

243
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,991
Profession?

244
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,113
Drainage, Sanitation
and Garbage Disposal Engineer, first class.

245
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,031
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

246
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,149
Qualifications?

247
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,109
Yes. I have a certificate from Chipping Sodbury
Technical College. That's in England.

248
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,234
And a reference from Lady Pushing, saying
what a good job I did on her sludge channel,

249
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,038
cos it was all...bunged up, you know.

250
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,993
And this was presented to me
by the Chipping Sodbury Ladies' Guild,

251
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,076
in appreciation for services rendered.

252
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,195
It's a sink plunger.

253
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,199
It's very interesting, Mr Knutt.
I fail to see how it can be of any use to us.

254
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,153
That's where you're wrong. I don't mind telling
you that since I arrived in America,

255
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,033
I've been amazed by your out-of-date methods.

256
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,993
I mean, for instance your way of disposing
of garbage is a load of rubbish.

257
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,155
And as for sanitation,

258
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,232
I think you'll agree it's an absurd waste
of the President's time

259
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,152
to have to walk from the White House all the way
to that little shed at the bottom of the garden.

260
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,156
And as for your city streets...

261
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,077
Mr Knutt!

262
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,029
May I suggest that you see the Public Works
Department down the corridor?

263
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,072
Oh. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

264
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,076
Just a minute. Mr Knutt!

265
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,150
Would you please take this with you?

266
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,236
Oh, yes. We mustn't forget that, must we?

267
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,031
I'm terribly sorry.

268
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,076
Yes?

269
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,071
Well, what do you want?

270
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,991
I was told you might give me a job.

271
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,112
Job? What job? Who the blazes are you?

272
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,196
Knutt. Marshall P Knutt.

273
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,192
Marshal? No-one available, huh?

274
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,198
Well, Marshal,
you couldn't have come at a better time.

275
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,151
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

276
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,158
How would you like to go
and clean up Stodge City for me?

277
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,191
Oh, very much, sir. In a bit of a mess, is it?

278
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,156
You said it, Marshal. One heck of a mess.

279
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,192
Funnily enough,
I was talking about that to the man outside.

280
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,119
- Now, I have one or two theories.
- Yes, I'm sure you have, Marshal.

281
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,159
But I'm a pretty busy man, so suppose you get
down to Stodge City and get to work, huh?

282
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,191
See Judge Burke. He'll tell you what's doing.

283
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,073
Judge Burke. Yes, and thank you very much.

284
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,036
Not at all, Marshal, not at all.

285
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,191
Stodge City.

286
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,993
Oh, right in the country.
Should be nice and peaceful.

287
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,031
(Shouting and gunfire)

288
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,033
- Who was that? Who did it?
- (Gunfire)

289
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,191
Isn't it sickening?
That's the tenth window broken in two weeks.

290
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,071
Who was it, Judge?

291
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,112
Some of those horrible friends
of the Rumpo Kid, of course.

292
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,151
Look at my hat. Just look at it.

293
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,192
Hey-hey! Three inches lower
and it would have been your head.

294
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,111
Don't say that!

295
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,038
Things have got pretty rough here
since he came.

296
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,073
Rough?
It ain't safe for decent folks to walk the streets.

297
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,038
Why, I have to send my wife out for everything.

298
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,072
Never mind. Things will get better
when they send that Marshal.

299
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,149
If they send him.

300
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,035
Oh...ha ha! Why, hello, Sam.
What brings you into town?

301
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,029
I tell you what brings me into town.
I lost 50 head of cattle on my ranch last night.

302
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,156
Rustlers?
- They certainly weren't pickpockets!

303
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,078
Well, there's no need to get all sarky.

304
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,157
50 head.
What's more, my prize bull was among 'em.

305
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,156
Not old Ramrod?

306
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,990
Yeah. How am I to raise cattle without a bull?
Judge, you gotta do something.

307
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,112
Well, it's hardly in my line of country, Sam.

308
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,152
You know darned well that Rumpo Kid
and his gang are behind this.

309
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,113
Yeah, you're probably right, Sam,
but how are you gonna prove it?

310
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,156
And stay out of here...bum.

311
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,191
# Lively fiddle and banjo

312
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,071
Johnny.

313
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,111
How about this for business, huh?

314
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,230
Yeah,
you sure have made a difference to the place.

315
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,033
Well, I like to see a bit of innocent fun.

316
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,198
Johnny, just look at these beautiful furs.
Silver fox and he only wants $50 a skin.

317
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,993
- Not bad.
- They'd make a lovely fur coat.

318
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,075
I don't like wearing fur.

319
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,031
No, Johnny, I meant for me.

320
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,152
I get it. You want me to buy 'em for you, huh?

321
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,077
Just 500 the lot, mister.

322
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,152
Right. I just gotta get some money
from the bank. Won't be a minute.

323
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,072
Morning, Mr Rumpo, sir. Anything for me today?

324
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,032
Not yet, Josh. Stick around. It's early.

325
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,195
(Gunshot)

326
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,031
(A body thuds onto floor)

327
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,116
Hey, that's the fourth in two weeks.

328
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,156
(Laughs) You're in the wrong business.

329
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,189
What's going on here?

330
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,996
# The Can Can

331
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,155
What is it, Judge?

332
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,158
Don't look. Whatever you do, don't look.

333
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,997
Why not?

334
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,032
You'll never believe it,
but there are women dancing in there

335
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,112
and showing their...underthings.

336
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,116
- No.
- Right up to here.

337
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,997
What do they look like?

338
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,034
They're sort of black and frilly,
with these little pink rosebuds on 'em.

339
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,073
What does it matter what they look like?
It's disgusting.

340
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,079
Why, in 15 years of married life,
I haven't even seen my wife's.

341
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,992
You don't need to worry.
They ain't got rosebuds on them.

342
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,076
I'm glad to hear it. I... What?

343
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,112
I'm kinda busy.
I've got some folk waiting in the surgery.

344
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,113
Oh, he must have seen them on the clothesline.

345
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,152
COWBOY: <i>Yahoo!</i>
- I'm gonna put a stop to this.

346
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,189
Stop! Stop!

347
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,028
- Stop! Stop!
- (Music stops)

348
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,032
Stop this disgraceful exhibition immediately!

349
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,109
Go on, get outta here!
And kindly adjust your dress before leaving.

350
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,149
Hey.

351
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,998
Just what do you think you're doing, Judge?

352
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,237
Mr Kid, as Mayor of this town,
and guardian of law and order,

353
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,119
I must object most strongly to this impropriety.

354
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,189
Impro...what?

355
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,118
All this jigging up and down
and lascivious dancing.

356
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,997
What? It's educational.

357
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,999
Educational? They never showed me
anything like that when I was at school.

358
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,076
That's what I mean. It's never too late to learn.

359
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,111
Sit down. Grab yourself a piece of culture.

360
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,156
Culture? Just a minute.

361
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,033
I suppose you think that's culture.

362
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,153
Nope. That's my Aunt Fanny. She give me that
as a sort of house-warming present.

363
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,037
Artistic, ain't it?

364
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,031
But she ain't got no clothes on.

365
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,196
Certainly not. She's in her working outfit.

366
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,117
- What?
- She's an artist's model.

367
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,230
I don't care if she's Lady Godiva.

368
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,994
She's gotta come down.
I can't have that sort of thing around here.

369
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,989
I'm determined to keep the Stodge out of sex.
The...the sex out of Stodge.

370
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,156
Suppose you get out of here
while you're in one piece.

371
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,156
I haven't finished yet.

372
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,996
Oh, no. There's something else. You've got
to stop shooting all them cashiers at the bank.

373
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,079
Wait. You can't blame me for that.
They won't let me draw no money.

374
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,156
Before you draw money out of a bank,

375
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,994
- you're supposed to put some in.
- That's a funny way to rob a bank.

376
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,160
And don't think I don't know who's behind all the
cattle-rustling that's been going on around here.

377
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,990
What cattle-rustling? You won't find
no cows here. Not the kind you're looking for.

378
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,999
Don't think you're gonna get away with it,
Rumpo. I'm gonna get you. Do you hear me?

379
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,189
I'm gonna get you.

380
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,117
Now's as good a time as any, Judge.

381
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,032
Don't get me wrong. I-I-I was only joking.

382
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,071
Make me laugh some more. Go for your gun.

383
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,111
(Kid chuckles)

384
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,152
Judge! Judge!

385
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,073
Judge...this telegraph just come for you.

386
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,032
A-ha! It's from Washington.

387
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,158
They're sending down a United States Marshal.

388
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,069
- A what?
- Yeah. Kinda changes things, doesn't it?

389
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,039
He'll arrive on the first stage from Denver. Huh!

390
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,149
BOTH: Yeah!

391
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,032
Excuse me. Do you go all the way?

392
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,032
- I-I beg your pardon?
- All the way...to Stodge City?

393
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,196
Oh, yeah. I have a job of work to do there.

394
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,232
Really? Oh, that's marvellous. So do I.

395
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,153
I'm a Drainage, Sanitation
and Garbage Disposal Engineer, first class.

396
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,998
I just knew you'd be something exciting like that.

397
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,996
I've been sent to clean up the town.

398
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,110
I had something in mind for myself like that.

399
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,076
- What are you going for?
- Vengeance.

400
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,195
Oh... What?

401
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,232
My father was Sheriff in Stodge City
and somebody shot him.

402
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,194
I'm going there to find out who.

403
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,071
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

404
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,157
But I don't think a nice girl like you
should be doing things like that.

405
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,072
I mean, even if you do find out who it was,
what can you do?

406
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,155
Kill him?

407
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,155
It's no use, Johnny.

408
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,079
If a Marshal's coming to Stodge,
we may just as well pack up and move on.

409
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,189
If he gets this far.

410
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,111
Well, how are you gonna stop him?

411
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,073
You take a shot at a Peace Marshal
and they'll send the US Cavalry to get you.

412
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,111
Belle's right, Kid. You can't touch a Marshal.

413
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,039
I know. But just supposing
that stage was to get raided by Indians?

414
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,109
Are you kidding?

415
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,073
There's only one lot of Indians left around here
and they couldn't raid a larder.

416
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,039
Maybe we could give 'em a hand.
Come on, Charlie, let's go and talk to 'em.

417
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,997
Stop!

418
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,110
How! We come in peace.

419
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,079
Look, here, Mr...Injun.
We ain't come here to buy a load of junk.

420
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,197
We wanna talk with the big chief. Savvy?

421
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,231
You wait.

422
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,993
Big chief in little lodge.

423
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,155
(Toilet flushes)

424
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,031
Oh, hello!

425
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,111
(Speaks tribal language)

426
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,069
Halt.

427
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,150
Me-um big pale-faced chief
from-um Stodge City.

428
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,192
Me-um salute-um big chief.

429
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,034
Me-um want-um powwow.

430
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,117
I say, you do talk funny.
You must be foreigners.

431
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,190
Why didn't you tell me he could talk English?

432
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,073
I'm sorry, Kid. I didn't know.

433
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,196
Chief, this is Johnny Finger,
known as the Rumpo Kid.

434
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,191
Oh, how do you do?

435
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,038
And a very charming name.

436
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,230
I'm called Man Ooh-ahh!

437
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,116
Roughly translated, it means "Big Heap".

438
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,195
Very picturesque.

439
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,196
And this is my son Little Heap.

440
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,118
Or as we say, Mini Man Ooh-ahh.

441
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,156
(Speaks tribal language)

442
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,230
No, you can't have their scalps.

443
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,191
The very idea. He's scalp mad.

444
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,074
Glad to hear that, Chief.
Maybe we can help him get one.

445
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,071
Oh, no, don't encourage him.

446
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,156
We can sit down and talk it over, can't we?

447
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,191
But, of course. Where are my manners?

448
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,198
I think you'll find this piece of ground
most comfortable. No sharp stones.

449
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,192
Son, tell my squaw to fetch the peace pipe.

450
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,155
Ugh!

451
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,156
You'd care for a piece of pipe?

452
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,073
Be glad to, Chief. I once talked peace
with the Sioux, but you can't trust 'em.

453
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,032
One minute, it was peace on,
the next...peace off.

454
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,156
You won't have any trouble with us,
I can assure you.

455
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,158
Personally, I hate fighting.

456
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,156
(Growls)

457
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,071
Ohhh.

458
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,236
This is my new squaw, Kitikata.

459
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,118
I bought her for two buffalo skins.

460
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,118
- How.
- Never mind how. Where?

461
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,151
(Pipe gurgles)

462
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,191
(Coughs)

463
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,158
What have you got in there - old moccasins?

464
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,079
- Thank you, no. I'm trying to give it up.
- I don't blame you.

465
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,032
You don't happen to have any fire water,
do you?

466
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,071
You like whisky?

467
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,032
Oh. My favourite brand.

468
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,072
Ah-ah. If I give you this,
I gotta have something in return.

469
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,111
She's yours.

470
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,997
Oh, no, not that.

471
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,038
Well...maybe...maybe that on account.

472
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,196
- What else do you want?
- A certain fella got rid of.

473
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,236
Where is he? On the stage.

474
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,196
Oh! I don't blame you.

475
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,073
I can't stand actors myself. Peculiar lot.

476
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,230
The stage<i>coach</i> coming in from Denver today.

477
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,118
All you gotta do is raid it and get him.

478
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,029
Oh, I don't like the sound of that. I'm told they
carry guns on these stages. It might get rough.

479
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,110
Your favourite brand. Try some.

480
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,116
Plenty more where that come from.

481
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,995
Well...

482
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,077
Cor.

483
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,190
Down with Custer.

484
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,078
Slaughter the Pale Faces.

485
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,031
Massacre the lot.

486
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,153
Ah. That's the signal from Little Heap.
They've sighted the stage.

487
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,031
Where?

488
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,033
Well, there. Don't you see the smoke signals?
Now, I must acknowledge them.

489
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,029
I'll be glad when this is over.
I feel a right Charlie in this get-up, I can tell you.

490
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,039
You look great: a sort of a cross
between Hiawatha and Rose Marie.

491
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,191
Eurgh. I still don't see
why we have to dress up like this?

492
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,156
Because we have to look like Injuns.

493
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,239
I don't trust that Big Heap out of my sight.
Now, quit beefing and give me that dynamite.

494
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,991
Come on, fella.

495
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,192
Here. If you can't stop that stage
any other way, use these.

496
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,151
Oh, thank you.

497
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,151
What are you messing about at?

498
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,078
I'm just trying to start a fire to answer Little Heap.

499
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,196
- Try a match.
- Oh, dear me, no.

500
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,069
Why, my people have been getting fire
this way for thousands of years. It's such fun.

501
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,997
What's that got to do with it?

502
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,156
They got kids the same way
for thousands of years, too.

503
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,149
Well?

504
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,077
Carry on with the sticks.

505
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,033
- All right, get on your horses.
- (Explosion)

506
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,111
(Laughs)

507
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,230
I say. It's never worked as well as that before.

508
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,195
Oh, we've stopped.

509
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,034
So we have. And I should think so, too.

510
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,191
12 hours is a long time
in a coach with no corridor.

511
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,077
Well, where is it?

512
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,038
We ain't stopped for that, mister.
Lookee up over there.

513
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,195
<i>Injuns.</i>

514
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,077
- What?
- Injuns?

515
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,189
You mean railway engines?

516
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,152
Red Injuns. Them's smoke signals.

517
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,196
- What do they mean?
- Danged if I know.

518
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,071
Ooh, I can tell you.

519
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,032
I bought a useful phrase book in Washington.

520
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,996
Smoke signals...

521
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,156
Ah, here it is. Now, what are they saying?

522
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,152
<i>Puff</i>...<i>puff, puff-puff</i>...

523
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,236
..<i>puff</i>...<i>puff</i>...<i>puff</i>...<i>puff</i>...

524
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,039
puff-puff...p-puff.

525
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,999
Here it is. "Please Direct me
to the ladies' or gentlemen's cloakroom."

526
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,076
Oh, that can't be right, can it?

527
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,237
Well, if it is, Indians can't be very particular.

528
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,028
Yeah, well, I ain't hanging around here,
listening to you puffing.

529
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,112
Cos all I know is,
where there's Injuns, there's trouble.

530
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,073
Trouble? Oh, don't be silly. There hasn't been
any trouble with Indians for years.

531
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,997
They're perfectly friendly now.

532
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,189
Call that friendly?

533
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,197
Oh, they're only playing. They wouldn't hurt us.

534
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,155
Some game.

535
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,077
(Indians whooping)

536
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,033
Now, what are we gonna do, mister?
Play with 'em?

537
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,111
Now, don't panic. It's all right.

538
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,156
I know what to do. Form a circle.

539
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,031
Yes, that's it! Form a circle.

540
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,229
With one coach?

541
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,119
- Oh, yes, that would be difficult.
- If you two don't mind, I'll get back in.

542
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,156
- That's a good idea.
- Oh, no, you don't, mister.

543
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,236
We're gonna need every man that we've got.

544
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,028
Now, you get a hold of that,
get up there and start shootin'!

545
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,071
(Gunfire)

546
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,116
I don't know
what we would have done without him.

547
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,150
I'd better get to work, I suppose.

548
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,191
(Indians whooping a war cry)

549
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,189
I got one!

550
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,031
Two that time, with only one bullet!

551
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,196
Look, they've shot three of my braves.

552
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,077
What do you want them to do?

553
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,192
Use bullets with those little rubber suction cups
stuck on the end?

554
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,156
Here, have a drop more courage.

555
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,115
That does it!

556
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,230
<i>Little Heap!</i>

557
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,992
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling off the attack.

558
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,079
Oompah! Stickity! Jumper! Bloody quick!

559
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,189
They're going!

560
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,238
Hey, come back.
You gonna let one little fella chase you away?

561
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,192
You call yourself braves?
I've seen braver cowards.

562
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,192
Wh-wh-wh-what happened?

563
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,031
Eugh.

564
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,036
They've run away. They've had enough.

565
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,112
Well, yeah, you get down off there
and we get out of here before they come back.

566
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,991
What hit me?

567
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,156
Oh, no. I don't believe it.

568
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,155
What happened to him?

569
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,033
- Oh, it was just the excitement, I guess.
- Oh.

570
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,156
- Get him in the coach.
- Hold this a minute.

571
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,157
Come on! Let's get out of here.
Come on! Come on, giddup! Giddup!

572
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,235
Giddup!

573
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,032
- Do you drive?
- Who? Me? Er, yes, I suppose so.

574
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,195
Well, I should start, if I were you.

575
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,152
- There's still a couple of Indians over there.
- Oh, right.

576
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,109
Yah! Yah!

577
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,991
Come on. Whoa.

578
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,196
We got to finish this ourselves, Charlie.

579
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,077
- Is he mad?
- Looks like it. I'm getting out of here. Giddup.

580
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,189
KID: <i>Ow!</i>

581
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,994
Charlie! Charlie! Help!

582
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,077
Ooh! Where you been?

583
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,032
- You want help getting on your horse, Kid?
- Are you joking?

584
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,196
- Ooh!
- (Laughs)

585
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,031
Ah, shut up!

586
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,195
(Laughs)

587
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,111
Ooh!

588
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,115
Shut up!

589
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,195
- Is he gonna be all right, Doc?
- Yeah, reckon so.

590
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,071
Pity.

591
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,031
He's coming round.

592
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,195
Something wrong with your drains.

593
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,118
He's delirious. Ah, poor feller.

594
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,072
- Indians! Indians!
- Where?

595
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,032
Listen, don't worry.
You're gonna be quite safe now.

596
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,072
He's gonna be all right.
He's just a bit shook up, that's all.

597
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,155
Pity.

598
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,197
Don't keep saying that. It gets on my nerves.

599
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,117
What exactly happened, Bert?

600
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,196
Well, I don't rightly know, for sure.

601
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,276
But from what Miss Oakley here says,

602
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,993
this young fella shot three Injuns
and drove the rest of 'em away.

603
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,156
Amazing. Is that right, miss?

604
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,111
Well, there was only him.

605
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,157
You couldn't expect a defenceless
little thing like me to do anything?

606
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,191
I suppose not.

607
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,196
It seems incredible.

608
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,153
Well, I think he was just wonderful.
I don't know what I'd have done without him.

609
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,229
Oh, it was nothing.

610
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,035
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to get settled in.
There is a hotel here, isn't there?

611
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,029
Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it, Miss Oakley.
They get a funny lot in there.

612
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,110
I think I can take care of myself, thank you.

613
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,156
- I'll take you over, Miss.
- Ah, thank you.

614
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,191
Gosh, this sure is heavy.

615
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,231
Just a few feminine, little knick-knacks.

616
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,229
Yeah.

617
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,069
Oh, she's lovely.

618
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,193
You won't have time for that sort of thing.
You've got work to do.

619
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,232
Don't worry, sir.
I'm very keen to get started right away.

620
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,199
That's the spirit.
I'll show you your office, Marshal.

621
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,118
Marshall? How did you know my name?

622
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,035
Washington told me you were coming.
I am Judge Burke, the Mayor.

623
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,117
That's right.
The Judge's folk founded Stodge City, Marshal.

624
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:46,194
My great grandfather came over here
on the Mayflower. He was the original Burke.

625
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,119
He married into the Wright family
and became a Wright-Burke.

626
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,111
The whole family are Wright-Burkes, Marshal.

627
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,149
Charming.

628
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,028
"Rumpo's Place".
It sounds pretty exclusive.

629
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,077
Yeah. The Rumpo Kid, that is, miss.
He runs this town.

630
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,192
- Don't you have a Sheriff?
- We did have, but he sort of died.

631
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,073
- Oh, really? How?
- Lead poisoning.

632
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,235
Who shot the lead into him?

633
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,030
I can't say, miss. And if I was you, I wouldn't ask
questions like that around these parts.

634
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,072
Right, in here. Charlie will fix you up with a room.

635
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,191
Here we are, Marshal.

636
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,119
Thank you, Judge, but I wish
you'd call me Marsh like my friends do.

637
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,236
- Marsh?
- Yes, it's short for Marshall.

638
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,232
- Oh, I couldn't do a thing like that.
- You couldn't?

639
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,068
No. It'd be like me calling the Sheriff "Sheree".

640
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,993
People around here
would have thought that mighty peculiar.

641
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,998
Well, this is it. How do you like it?

642
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,155
Oh, it's very cosy.

643
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,070
And there's a nice bedroom for you through
there, and plenty of guns for you to use.

644
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,036
Oh, thank you very much.

645
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,031
But what do I want guns for?

646
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,116
Don't tell me you've got rats around here.

647
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,991
Have we got rats?

648
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,999
Ever since the Rumpo Kid came to town,
the place has been full of them.

649
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,235
That's not so good.
They didn't tell me that was your problem.

650
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,198
Well, never mind. I'm sure you'll get rid of them.

651
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,119
Oh, yes. Mind you, I won't be going round
shooting these rats, Judge.

652
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,118
The thing to do is to find out
where they do their breeding.

653
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,116
- Really?
- So as you don't get any more.

654
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,192
Well, that sounds like a long-term policy to me.

655
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,028
Still, I'm sure you must know what you're doing.

656
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,191
Oh, yes. In my experience,
they usually do it down in the drains.

657
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,118
You must have had
some very funny experiences.

658
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,152
I have. Well, you can't be
a drainage engineer without, you know.

659
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,079
- A what?
- A drainage engineer. That's my job.

660
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,071
But you're a Marshal.

661
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,189
No, Marshall's my name.

662
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,031
Marshall P Knutt. Drainage, sanitation
and garbage disposal engineer, first class.

663
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,039
They sent me down here to clean the place up.
Didn't they tell you?

664
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,112
But we want a Peace Marshal,
not a Drainee Marshal.

665
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,037
Drain<i>age,</i> -age, -age.

666
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,074
Oh! Don't you understand?
This town is full of gunmen and outlaws.

667
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,076
That's what we want cleaned up.

668
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,156
You mean, there isn't a job for me?

669
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,073
Of course there isn't a job for...

670
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,150
Wait a minute.

671
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,073
No-one around here knows
you're not a real Marshal, do they?

672
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,156
Oh, Annie Oakley. I told her my job.

673
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,069
Oh, she don't matter.
And you did shoot them Indians single-handed?

674
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,155
Granted, yes.

675
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,039
Come to think of it,
you'll make a marvellous Marshal.

676
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,039
- Who, me?
- Yes. You'll clean up Stodge City.

677
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,153
Oh, you'll become the most admired,
the most feared man in the West.

678
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,236
Oh, they'll write books about you.

679
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,198
<i>I can see it: "The Legend of Marshal P Knutt".</i>

680
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,158
"The Legend of Marshall P Knutt."

681
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,112
All right, Curly, round up the boys.
We've got a job on tonight.

682
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,109
Sure thing, Kid.

683
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,072
- Give me a drink, Charlie.
- You ought to know, Mr Rumpo,

684
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,033
that woman that's staying here's
asking a lot about Sheriff Earp's death.

685
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,155
What woman who's staying here?

686
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,191
She came in on the stage. I let her have a room.

687
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,196
- Where is she?
- Upstairs. Room 11.

688
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,153
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't like women who ask awkward questions.

689
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,038
She's going out of here on her big, fat bustle.

690
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,077
(Knock on door)
- Come in!

691
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,150
All right, lady, just pack your bags and...

692
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,077
I thought you were the maid.

693
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,111
I am.

694
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,993
You don't look too much
like a chambermaid to me.

695
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,075
It's my day off.

696
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,156
You must be the one they call
the Rumpo Kid, huh?

697
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,031
Yep. That's me.

698
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,071
And you want me to pack my bags and leave?

699
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,116
Leave? Where did you get that idea?

700
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,197
Well, I thought...
What did you come in here for, then?

701
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,231
Just to say welcome.

702
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,151
I hope you have a long and friendly stay here.

703
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,191
Well, thank you. Thank you.

704
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,198
You just ask for anything you want.
It's all on the house.

705
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,033
Thank you.
Right now I'd like to get out of my bath.

706
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,996
Oh. Give you a hand?

707
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,031
No, no, but you can pass a towel if you like.

708
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,189
Yep.

709
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,156
Here you are.

710
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,036
All right, I won't look.

711
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,071
- No?
- Nope.

712
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,076
Oh, well. Worth a try.

713
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,150
Yeah, well...it was er...nice er...seeing you.

714
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,191
And you, too. You've been very sweet to me.

715
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,117
Well, did you do it?

716
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,038
- Did I do what?
- Did you tell her to go?

717
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,157
Oh, that. Yeah, sure. I gave it to her straight,
cards on the table, man to man.

718
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,031
Man to man, huh?

719
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,155
Yup. Right between the eyes.

720
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,997
So she's going?

721
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,999
Nope. The fact is, Belle, she's straight.
I reckon she's not trying to hide nothing.

722
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,189
She couldn't. Not in that bath.

723
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,198
You're right there. Boy, has she got...

724
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,156
Oh. You saw.

725
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,035
Yeah, well, I happened to be standing here
and the keyhole came up against my eye.

726
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,117
(Laughs nervously)
Well...then y-y-you saw for yourself.

727
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,997
I mean, she's nice...a nice girl.

728
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,156
You can't go throwing
a poor little thing like that out.

729
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,119
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, yeah. I know just how it is.

730
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,111
Reckon she does know how it is, too.

731
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,076
(Chortles)

732
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,192
The Rumpo Kid.
He's the one we gotta get something on.

733
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,994
He's behind everything
that's going on around here.

734
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,031
Why didn't you just run him out of town, then?

735
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,156
Everybody's scared stiff of him.

736
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,151
Except me, of course.

737
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,111
Pardon me.

738
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,149
Mind if I come in?

739
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,069
Why, of course, Mr Rumpo.
We're always delighted to see you.

740
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,071
I wanted to meet the new Marshal.

741
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,031
Oh, thank you.

742
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,113
I thought I'd tip you off. There's going to be
another raid on Colonel Houston's cattle tonight.

743
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,071
What? How do you know?

744
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,992
A stranger came into my place
and told one of the girls.

745
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,076
- You don't say.
- Yup.

746
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,231
The girl's not involved, mind you.
She's a nice, pure, innocent kid.

747
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,118
He just happened to talk in his sleep.

748
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,116
Well, thank you for telling me, Mr Rumpo.

749
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,033
A pleasure, Marshal. Any time I can do
anything to help, don't be afraid to ask.

750
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,153
Gentlemen, if you'll pardon me, I've promised
to talk to the Ladies' Sewing Circle.

751
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,156
He doesn't seem such a bad fellow.

752
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,995
Don't you believe it.
There's something funny going on around here.

753
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:23,239
Why, I'm almost positive he and his gang
are doing all the cattle-rustling around here.

754
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,994
Impossible. He wouldn't have come in
and told us if it was him.

755
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,031
No. No, that's a point.

756
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,076
We've gotta do some quick thinking.

757
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,078
"Tonight", he said. That's today.

758
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,113
That's pretty quick thinking.
Don't overdo it. Leave it to me.

759
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,072
Now, let me see... Now...

760
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:46,996
The best plan would be for you to ride out there
after dark...and surprise 'em.

761
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,077
- All by myself?
- No, no, no. You gotta take a posse with you.

762
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,033
- Why? Don't they like cats?
- A posse! Not a pussy!

763
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,158
You can't go out there and handle
a whole gang of rustlers and killers by yourself.

764
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,156
- Can't I?
- No, no.

765
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,069
You've got to find some brave
and public-spirited citizens to help you.

766
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,038
Oh, yes, I see. Like you, you mean.

767
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,075
Exactly.

768
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,237
Except that, unfortunately,
tonight I have another engagement.

769
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,115
Any other night, of course.

770
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,153
But don't worry. You're bound to find somebody.

771
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,071
Yeah!

772
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,997
Yup.

773
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,189
Howdy, Marshal.

774
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,117
What can I do for you?

775
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,196
Well, actually, I'm trying to get up a posse.

776
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,071
Oh? For tonight, you mean?

777
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,072
That's right. I thought you
and a few of your men could er...

778
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,112
Oh, it's a pity, Marshal. I'm sorry.
We can't help you tonight.

779
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,159
We got a little choir practice.
I promised the boys. Right, boys?

780
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,075
Oh. It's funny, but everyone I've asked
so far seems to be doing something else.

781
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,032
Ah, gee, that's tough, Marshal. Ain't it?

782
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,039
Wait a minute. I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you two of my boys. Short.

783
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,076
- Yeah, boss.
- I got a little job for you.

784
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,112
Take these two, Marshal - Short and Curly.

785
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,109
How do you do?

786
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,195
Who was that?

787
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,038
Just Rumpo and some of the boys, Marshal.

788
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,156
Oh! Off to their choir practice.

789
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,998
I'm sorry if I'm making you miss yours.

790
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,077
That's all right, Marshal.
We'll get up extra early and do some.

791
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,112
Oh, good.
By the way, I've got your Deputy badges.

792
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,997
No, thank you, Marshal.

793
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,191
It ain't wise to wear them.
Makes too easy a target.

794
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,152
Oh...yes.

795
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,116
Well, I suppose we'd better be off, then.

796
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,156
Yup. Got a horse all ready for you, Marshal.

797
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,988
Oh...yes. Yes, that's a horse, all right.

798
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,990
Looks like you forgot to fasten your girth,
Marshal. (Laughs)

799
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,076
Hey, come back! Horse!

800
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,036
Horse!

801
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,071
(Cattle low)

802
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,031
The herd seems mighty restless.

803
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,229
You hear anything, Joe?

804
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,157
Nice work. When you're through,
take a handful of steers up to Bear Pass.

805
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,998
I'm going to see Sam Houston. Come on!

806
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,991
(Laughter)

807
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,032
- Howdy, mister.
- Howdy, Colonel.

808
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,038
I was just up in the high ground
getting the stock in.

809
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,157
I've just seen some fellas making off
with a whole heap of your cattle.

810
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,077
The hell you say.

811
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,159
- Jake! Get them ready to ride!
- Sure thing, Colonel.

812
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,151
I'm mighty grateful to you, mister.

813
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,077
Whereabouts you saw 'em?

814
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,031
They were just coming over Bear Pass.

815
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,069
What you say?

816
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,991
Bear...Pass.

817
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,998
Oh. My hearing isn't so good these days.

818
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,191
That's the cattle, all right.

819
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,117
They've got the Bar X brand on 'em.

820
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,036
Well, where are all the rustlers, then?

821
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,989
Well, I reckon just the sight of you, Marshal,
must have scared them away.

822
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,070
Oh, yes, I suppose so.

823
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,076
Well, what are we gonna do now, then?

824
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,193
Well, I reckon the best thing we can do
is to leave you to look after them steers

825
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,077
while we ride and get us some help.

826
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,997
Just what I was going to suggest.

827
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,031
- There they are, Colonel.
- Yeah!

828
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,196
Come on! Let's get 'em! Hah!

829
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,077
(Gunshots)

830
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,997
Colonel Houston?

831
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,189
Yeah. That's me.

832
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,111
Oh.

833
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,234
Do you mind if I do this, Colonel?

834
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,120
As an upright and law-abiding citizen of
Stodge City and a lifelong friend of Sheriff Earp,

835
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,071
I consider it my duty.

836
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,036
Your privilege, sir.

837
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,071
What do you think you're doing?

838
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,116
You're making a terrible mistake, you know.

839
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,197
- I can sue you for this. I've got my rights.
- Pipe down, will you?

840
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,151
What are you getting so excited about?

841
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,118
I can't help it.
I've always been nervous and highly strung.

842
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,196
You're about to be strung even higher, pal.

843
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,038
Right, we'll just take the other end and make it...

844
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,195
- Ugh!
- ..good and tight.

845
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,077
Yahoo!

846
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,155
Yahoo!

847
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,077
Ruffians!

848
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,031
Marshal! Marshal!

849
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,071
It's me - Judge Burke.

850
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,031
(Knock on door)

851
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,197
What are you doing in there?
You can't stay locked up all the time.

852
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,033
You're supposed to be keeping law and order.

853
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,109
Oh, no.

854
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,032
He's out to get me. I know it. That Rumpo.

855
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,231
Don't be silly. They wouldn't dare
do anything to a US Marshal.

856
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,993
"Wouldn't dare do anything", he says.

857
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,157
Judge, I was nearly hanged the other night,
like a common criminal.

858
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,196
Oh, you don't wanna worry about that.

859
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,073
Some of my best friends have been hanged.

860
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,190
There ain't no stigma attached to it out West.

861
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,034
Well, they can't fool me. It was Rumpo's doing.
He arranged the whole thing.

862
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,072
Oh, come on, now. You're imagining things.

863
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,113
Both he and old Sam apologised very nicely
the next day.

864
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,039
It was a natural mistake
to make in the circumstances.

865
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,071
Do I look like a cattle rustler?

866
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:04,193
No, but you don't look
like a sanitary inspector either.

867
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,199
I am not a sanitary inspector!
I am a sanitation engineer, first class!

868
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,198
Shh. Do you want everybody to hear?

869
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,237
Look, first of all the Indian attack
on the stage coach.

870
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,196
Then this cattle rustling business.

871
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,028
That didn't happen by accident.
That was planned to get me out of the way.

872
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,998
And it would have worked
if that fella hadn't come to my rescue.

873
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,155
Yeah, who was he?

874
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,232
I don't know.
He just untied my hands and he galloped off.

875
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,196
- But I'd know him again, all right.
- How?

876
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,118
He had a very strong smell of perfume.

877
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,071
Really?

878
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,111
We're getting a funny lot round here.

879
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,071
(Knock on door)
- Who is it?

880
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,229
<i>Sam Houston</i>.

881
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,155
What is it? What's the matter?

882
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,079
They were at my place again last night.
Yes! Got away with 40 head.

883
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,235
Who were they? Did you see 'em?

884
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,993
It was too dark to see much.

885
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,076
Yeah,
but I recognised it was one of Rumpo's men.

886
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,236
Marshal, you've gotta do something.

887
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,195
Well, I don't see what I can do without any proof.

888
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,118
Here's proof for you. Take a look at that.

889
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,118
You match up those hoof prints
and you've got your man.

890
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,196
But how did they get up there?

891
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,231
What have you been doing?

892
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,993
Well, I was out courting.

893
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,076
There's no law against it.

894
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,993
No, no, of course not, but I can think of
more comfortable places to do it.

895
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,192
Marshal, I think it's time
you and Rumpo had a little talk.

896
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,074
Well, if you think there's evidence.
You know, personally, I don't...

897
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,196
Now, there's nothing to be afraid of.

898
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,158
They wouldn't dare do anything
to a US Marshal.

899
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,196
Here they come now! Stop 'em!

900
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,076
Well, gentlemen, a toast.

901
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,078
To our own beloved Marshal P Knutt,

902
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,157
accidentally run over today
by a band of unknown horsemen, RIP.

903
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,037
(Laughter)

904
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,071
(Wolf whistling)

905
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,229
What's the matter?

906
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,075
(Growls)

907
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,032
# The night is young

908
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,230
# And we're not too old

909
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,151
# Why wait for fate to give you a shove?

910
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,033
# When I am yours

911
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,993
# To have and to hold

912
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,113
# This is the night for love

913
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,198
# For I am willing

914
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,196
# And awfully weak

915
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,109
# And just the kind to take advantage of

916
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,071
# So why not push

917
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,237
# Your new lucky streak?

918
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,075
# This is the night for love

919
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,998
# My arms are yearning

920
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,235
# To hold you ever so near

921
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,116
# My lips are burning

922
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,196
# Just for your kiss

923
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,112
# There's no returning

924
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,112
# To me it's all very clear

925
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,989
# There'll never be another night like this

926
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,118
# So hold me close

927
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,197
# Till daylight is near

928
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,990
# Closer than a hand in a glove

929
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,998
# And say those words

930
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,190
# I'm longing to hear

931
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,194
# This is the night for holding me tight

932
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,151
# For this

933
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,113
# Is the night for love

934
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,077
I didn't know you could sing.

935
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,078
Well, I've hardly seen anything of you
since I arrived.

936
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,071
Have you er...been avoiding me?

937
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,112
I should say not.
I got a lot of business to do lately.

938
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,993
- At night?
- Why, it's the most convenient time.

939
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,109
My customers are asleep then.

940
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:24,036
Say, it's er...awful crowded in here.
Is there somewhere private we could...talk?

941
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:28,198
Yep. My office.
I got a nice big couch there for sitting, talking on.

942
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,077
Well, what are we waiting for, then?

943
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,998
Well, you go right ahead. I gotta get something.

944
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,109
OK.

945
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,152
Charlie, quick. Come on, Charlie!
Gimme a bottle.

946
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,998
Sure thing, Kid. Champagne?

947
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,155
What else?

948
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,158
- You...you can't go to her, Johnny.
- Don't talk so silly.

949
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,034
Don't turn our story into a burning tale of lust,
jealousy and passion

950
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,229
under a white-hot desert sun.

951
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,153
Don't make it a saga of sex, vengeance
and sudden death in the primitive West.

952
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,031
Are you delirious?

953
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,191
But, Johnny, she's no good.
Take it from me, she's after something.

954
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,038
If you get out of the way, she's gonna get it.

955
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,076
But, Johnny, have you forgotten?

956
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,195
I'm your little Ding Dong.

957
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,198
I hate to have to say it,
but your Ding has lost its Dong.

958
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,118
(Sniggers) Reckon you lost him, Belle.

959
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,237
How about doing a...little something for me, eh?
Heh heh!

960
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,993
- OK.
- Hee hee hee!

961
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,031
(Laughter)

962
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,077
Here's to us.

963
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,996
Oh, no, Johnny. No, don't.

964
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,110
Annie, I'd do anything.
I'd buy you diamonds, furs.

965
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,151
I'll make you a partner. I'll shave every day.

966
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,071
I know, but, you see, it's no use.

967
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,032
- I'm saving myself for another.
- Another what?

968
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,031
- Another man.
- Who?

969
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,117
The man who killed the man who killed my man.

970
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,197
- I got lost. Would you mind repeating that?
- OK, I'll try and explain.

971
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,074
You see, there once was a Sheriff here
called Earp - Albert Earp.

972
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,115
What about him?

973
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,153
Well, a long time ago,
he once shot somebody very dear to me,

974
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,191
and I just long for somebody to kill Earp.

975
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,997
They have. He's dead.

976
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:16,192
I know. And whoever it was that shot Earp
is the one I'm saving myself for.

977
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,198
You see,
I have nothing else to offer as a reward.

978
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,191
It was me. I shot the old codger.

979
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,196
- You're...
- The man who killed the man

980
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,077
who killed your man.

981
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,196
Oh, I hoped it would be you.
My search is ended.

982
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,231
You can stop saving yourself now.

983
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,195
- Oh, no. no. Not this way!
- What other way is there?

984
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,038
I mean, not here. Not here in an office.

985
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,231
Come to my room at ten o'clock
and er...I'll be waiting for you.

986
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,038
- Your room?
- Uh-huh.

987
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,071
- Ten o'clock?
- Mm-hmm.

988
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,111
You'll be waiting?

989
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,076
Mm-hmm.

990
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,195
(Growls)

991
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,117
What are you doing?

992
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,197
That ain't fair! They said you were dead!

993
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,158
A fine doctor you turned out to be.

994
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,112
No, he was dead when I took his pulse.
I swear it.

995
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,033
- When you took his pulse?
- I never thought of that. My watch has stopped.

996
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,195
What happened?

997
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,034
Rumpo and his gang,
they rode their horses right over you.

998
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,038
Well, that does it.
I've had just about enough of Rumpo.

999
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,110
I'll get something on him if it's the last thing I do.

1000
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,072
- It probably will be.
- Yeah!

1001
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,235
We're here.

1002
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,036
Oh, good. What's on the clock?

1003
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,230
Little Heap make no charge for his own father.

1004
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,993
Oh, that's a good boy.

1005
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,192
Well, now you run along home - straight home.
No stopping to pick up any stray bits of scalp.

1006
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,118
You take big risk, going in saloon, Father.

1007
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,112
Rumpo say he kill you if he see you again.

1008
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,072
Well, I can't help that. I've got to have fire water.

1009
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,998
How you buy fire water with no dollars?

1010
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:12,079
Ah-ha-ha. Big Heap has inherited
all the cunning of his forefathers.

1011
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,235
Give me a hand, son.

1012
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,071
Gold strike at Bear Creek!

1013
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,118
It never fails. It never fails.

1014
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,189
Ooh!

1015
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,077
Ho ho ho!

1016
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,197
One minute to ten.
Her room, and she'll be waiting.

1017
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,155
(Growls)

1018
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,036
- Oh, hello.
- How.

1019
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,195
Who's that?

1020
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,118
It's me - Rumpo. Are you ready?

1021
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,190
Could you wait just one moment, honey?

1022
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,196
OK. Come on in.

1023
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,077
BIG HEAP: <i>Down with Custer!</i>

1024
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,079
Big Heap. Just a minute, sweetheart.
I forgot something.

1025
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,073
BIG HEAP: <i>Let's all go and hold up the stage!</i>

1026
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,111
Big Heap. What the heck are you doing here?

1027
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,118
- It's my old friend - the Crumpet Kid.
- Rumpo Kid.

1028
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,157
Same thing. I say, remember you got me
to hold up that stage coach?

1029
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,191
Shut up. You want the whole town to hear?

1030
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,232
What is this? Where is everybody?

1031
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,993
Charlie! What's going on? Where you been?

1032
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,079
I'm sorry, Kid. Some joker came in, shouting
that there was a gold strike at Bear Creek.

1033
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,999
- Was there?
- I got three miles before I remembered,

1034
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,076
there ain't no place called Bear Creek.

1035
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,113
Big Heap take heap big paleface mickey.
(Laughs)

1036
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,038
It was him. I'll kill him!

1037
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,036
No, no. I don't want no trouble, not now.

1038
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,231
I've got some important business waiting.
Lock him up in the office.

1039
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,191
- Get him out of here. Quick.
- (Laughs)

1040
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,993
KNUTT: <i>Hold it right there, Rumpo</i>.

1041
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,189
Now what?

1042
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,190
- Marshal.
- That's right. I want to talk to you.

1043
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,118
OK. Drop by tomorrow. I'm kinda busy right now.

1044
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,236
Are you gonna walk down
or do I have to shoot you down?

1045
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,115
OK.

1046
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,197
Fantastic.
A fella can't even live up to his name these days.

1047
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,999
- What do you want?
- Rumpo... (Gulps) I'm taking you in.

1048
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:34,113
- You couldn't take in dirty washing.
- You heard me. I'm taking you in.

1049
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:38,079
If you feel like trying to stop me, just you try it.
I'm ready for you.

1050
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,109
(Thud)

1051
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,031
I told you that was too loose.

1052
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,076
I can't wear it any tighter. It pinches me tummy.

1053
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:49,149
Oh, you can laugh, Rumpo,
but we've really got something on you this time.

1054
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,191
Go on, Marshal, you tell him.

1055
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,159
Well, it seems that last night Colonel Houston's
ranch was raided again by rustlers.

1056
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,158
- What's that got to do with me?
- That's got a lot to do with you.

1057
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,111
They got away with 40 cows.

1058
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,156
- Bullocks.
- I know what I'm talking about.

1059
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,156
So do I. They was bullocks.

1060
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,039
Oh, what does it matter
if they was cows or bullocks?

1061
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,032
- It matters to them.
- Oh, this ain't getting us nowhere.

1062
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,991
Now, take a look at this.

1063
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:20,071
This here hide came off a Bar X steer,
and we found it in your stable.

1064
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,112
Yeah, and that ain't all.
The hoof prints on the back of my coat

1065
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,111
match up with those of your horse.

1066
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,152
You may as well admit it, Rumpo.
You stole his cattle.

1067
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,078
We've got you by the shorthorns.

1068
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,153
I'd like to help you, but unfortunately I loaned
my horse to somebody else last night.

1069
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,077
What?

1070
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,991
Where were you?

1071
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,157
Here, all night.
Belle will tell you what I was doing.

1072
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,236
Not in my court, she won't.

1073
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,155
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the fella you want
is the fella that used my horse last night.

1074
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,988
- Who was it?
- An Injun, name of Big Heap.

1075
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,077
Oh. Well, it looks like
we've got the wrong man, Judge.

1076
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,112
That's right. If you'll pardon me,
I got business to attend to.

1077
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,157
Yeah, but just you watch it, Rumpo,
because I aim to get you.

1078
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,192
Yeah, you'll see. We'll get something on you yet.

1079
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,073
That's far enough, Marshal.
Shall I plug 'em, Kid?

1080
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,157
- Nope.
- Yes. Go on, let him! Go on, Charlie.

1081
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,038
- Hey, steady, Judge.
- That's exactly what we want.

1082
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,190
Then we'll have something on them.
Use your nut, Knutt.

1083
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,028
Oh, Judge. You know we got more sense
than to shoot a US Marshal.

1084
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,153
Charlie was only kidding. Now, would you get
out of here, please? We're closing for the night.

1085
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,033
All right! But we'll be back!

1086
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,190
- Now?
- No! Get out, you old fool!

1087
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,189
Come on.

1088
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,151
Well, here we go.

1089
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,193
I heard you in there, Kid. That was a smart trick,
saying Big Heap stole those steers.

1090
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,152
Yeah. But if the Marshal talks to him,
we're in trouble.

1091
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,195
Like me to get rid of him?

1092
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,994
Later. Just keep him locked up for now.
I gotta see Miss Oakley.

1093
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,235
- Why? What's she done?
- Nothing yet. That's the trouble.

1094
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,231
CHARLIE: <i>Hey, Kid! Kid! Big Heap's gone!</i>

1095
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,231
This just ain't my night.

1096
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,116
He must have got out through the window.

1097
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,038
Don't just stand there.
He can't be far away. Come on.

1098
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,112
- Up the Indians!
- Here, you can't do that.

1099
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,116
We gotta get him out of there quick.

1100
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,032
It's not gonna be easy,
with that Marshal sleeping there.

1101
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,150
No. We'll have to keep him occupied.

1102
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,998
Why did this have to happen tonight?

1103
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,113
I'll get Curly and the boys. You tell Miss Oakley
I've been unavoidably detained.

1104
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,991
Leave it to me, Kid.

1105
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,189
(Knock on door)

1106
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,071
Come and get it.

1107
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,071
(Gunfire)

1108
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,037
(Crashing below)

1109
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:09,108
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I-I-I thought you were somebody else. Oh.

1110
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,071
Good night, Mum.

1111
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,111
(Knock on door)

1112
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,071
Yes?

1113
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,997
Just hold it right there.

1114
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,234
I hope that's your gun, Marshal.

1115
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,119
Miss Belle. What are you doing here?
Think of your reputation.

1116
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,038
<i>You</i> think about it
and stop asking stupid questions.

1117
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,031
Stop! What are you getting undressed for?

1118
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,230
- I wanna catch up with you.
- What? Ooh!

1119
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,032
Oh, you don't have to be so modest with me,
Marshal.

1120
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,076
You're a fine-looking man, you know.

1121
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,038
- I am?
- Yeah. I kinda go for men who wear long-coms.

1122
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,992
I knew a fella who escaped from prison
in a pair of coms.

1123
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,031
He got out through the trap door at the back.

1124
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,116
Yes. Coms really do something to me.

1125
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,151
They do something to me, too. Itch.

1126
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,033
You didn't come here
just to talk about underwear.

1127
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,992
- You're right, Marshall. How would you like it...
- Oh, no.

1128
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,237
..if I gave you proof that Rumpo was behind
the stage hold-up and the cattle rustling?

1129
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,073
What? But why are you telling me all this?

1130
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,190
Maybe it's because I go for you, Marshal, honey.

1131
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:59,028
Don't you feel it,
that certain something between us?

1132
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,190
Yes. It's my hot water bottle.

1133
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,191
No, we were meant for each other, you and me.

1134
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,231
We go together like ham and eggs.

1135
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,196
- Oh, Mother.
- (Knock on door)

1136
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,038
What was that? Are you expecting anyone?

1137
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,150
- No, of course not.
- If it's Rumpo, he'll kill me.

1138
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,111
- I must hide.
- Where?

1139
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,116
- Under the bed. Quick.
- Good idea.

1140
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,071
No, not you, you fool. Me.

1141
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,118
- Miss Oakley.
- Marshal, I've come to give myself up.

1142
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:39,073
- I've just killed a man.
- Well, we all make silly mistakes now and...

1143
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,071
- Killed a man?
- Uh-huh.

1144
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,038
Charlie the barman.
But it was an accident, I swear it.

1145
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,195
Of course it was. How did it happen?

1146
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,073
- I shot him with a shotgun...
- Oh.

1147
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,156
..a rifle, and two revolvers.

1148
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,156
- It must have been some accident.
- It was.

1149
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,156
I thought it was the Rumpo Kid.

1150
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,079
You see, I found out tonight
that he was the one that killed Sheriff Earp.

1151
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,156
Oh, Marsh, I feel just...terrible.

1152
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,237
Oh, there, there. Don't worry about it.
Come and sit down for a minute.

1153
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,073
Ahh! Oh!

1154
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,997
My gun.

1155
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,191
You're very sweet.
I feel sort of safe with you somehow.

1156
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,151
That's what they all say.

1157
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,998
Oh, have you known lots of girls, then?

1158
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,112
Oh, no. No, none at all. It's my job, I suppose.

1159
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,236
You don't get to meet them down drains.

1160
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,231
Well, I'm glad because I've never felt like this
about anybody before.

1161
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,194
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1162
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:31,199
I feel like we sort of go together like...
strawberries and cream.

1163
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,038
BELLE: <i>Or ham and eggs.</i>
- Yeah, or...

1164
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,237
- Oh, Lord.
- I'm sorry, Marshal, but I can't lie there,

1165
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,195
listening to this witch
talking out the back of her bustle.

1166
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,073
- No other girls, huh?
- Wait a minute. I can explain.

1167
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,031
Oh, don't bother.

1168
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,116
And with an old bag like that.

1169
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,156
And who are you calling an old bag?

1170
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:52,038
You, old bag, I'm calling an old bag.

1171
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,150
Ahh! You cat. I'll get you! Ahh!

1172
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,991
(Shrieking and yelling)

1173
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,037
(Thudding against wall)

1174
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,116
Ahh!

1175
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,111
Think of the neighbours.

1176
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,195
Ladies, please.

1177
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:18,074
Now, look what you've done.
Oh, I'm sorry, Marshal, really, I am.

1178
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,031
Marsh, honey, are you all right?

1179
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,031
There, there. Belle will make it up to you.

1180
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,234
Take your hands off him, you big troll!

1181
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,228
Look, you leave him alone, you harpy!

1182
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,991
I said I can take care of him, you cowgirl.

1183
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,190
Cowgirl? If I called you that, I'd only be half right.

1184
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,196
Why, you...

1185
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,031
Oh. Oh, Marsh. Marsh, honey.

1186
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,997
LITTLE HEAP: <i>There he is.</i>

1187
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,032
- I get-um quick.
- Not so fast. I'll handle this.

1188
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,077
- Me want-um Daddy.
- We going to get-um Daddy.

1189
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,036
Now, shut-um up-um.

1190
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,229
- Dolores, come here.
- What?

1191
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,153
Get yourself into the Marshal's office.
Keep him occupied for half an hour.

1192
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,112
- How?
- What do you want - diagrams?

1193
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:02,033
Well, half an hour's a long time.
What are we gonna talk about?

1194
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,117
- I should have known better.
- Ugh.

1195
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,112
Remember the things your ma told you not to do
when you came out West?

1196
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,997
- Yes.
- Do 'em.

1197
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,072
There, there, my poor boy.
Leave him alone. He's mine.

1198
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,997
- He's mine!
- He's mine!

1199
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,234
No, please, ladies!

1200
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,993
(Knock on door)
- Rumpo!

1201
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,991
Shh.

1202
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,072
Why, hello there, you old Marshal, honey.

1203
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,076
W-W-What is this? W-W-What do you want?

1204
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,192
Now, that's not a nice way to talk
to a little old girl who's dropped by

1205
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,231
just to keep y'all from getting lonesome.

1206
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,036
Oh, I've been anything but lonesome.

1207
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,229
Don't be like that, Marshal, honey.

1208
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,034
Why, since the first time I saw you,
I've been crazy about y'all.

1209
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:06,033
You and me, we'll go together
like pancakes and syrup, I reckon.

1210
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,036
All you people think about is food.

1211
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,230
Doesn't anyone around here
go together like man and woman?

1212
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,118
Now you're talking my kind of language.

1213
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,116
Oh, no, no! No, stay away!

1214
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,156
Ahh!
Ahh!

1215
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,038
Land sakes, what are they all doing here?

1216
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,991
You get out of here, you little tramp!

1217
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,999
Well, don't you worry. I don't aim on sharing him
with a couple of old hags like you.

1218
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,996
I got my pride.

1219
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,031
Why, you...

1220
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,036
(Shrieks)

1221
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,155
Oh, no, you don't!

1222
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,112
(Shrieking)

1223
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,157
I know it's the Wild West,
but this is ridiculous.

1224
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,110
Do you want to be a hero?
Stick that in the keyhole.

1225
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,155
Keyhole?

1226
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,192
Yeah, keyhole... Er keyhole-um.

1227
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:02,155
Ah, keyhole-um. Why you no say?
White man speak with forked tongue.

1228
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,230
- Well, go on. It's only a half-minute fuse.
- Oh.

1229
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,232
Soon as it blows, we get Big Heap
and get out of town fast.

1230
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,156
No can stick in keyhole-um.

1231
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,997
Key in keyhole-um.

1232
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,109
Well, take the key out.

1233
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,189
Ah.

1234
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,198
"Key in keyhole-um." Oh, no. Come back!

1235
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,109
Here is key-um.

1236
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,072
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Well, what is it?

1237
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,195
I thought I heard something.

1238
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,115
Little Heap?

1239
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,071
Where the heck is he?

1240
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,996
Ha ha ha ha!

1241
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,077
What a send-up.
Get Big Heap. Let's get out of here.

1242
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,195
Big Heap.

1243
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,195
Would you believe it?

1244
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,071
Big Heap. Come on, wake up.

1245
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,076
You girls stay here. Understand?

1246
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,195
All right, carry him out.

1247
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,236
Oh, no, you don't. Stick 'em up. Get back in.

1248
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,991
Go on, get back. Back. Now. Reach.

1249
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,232
So that's your little game, eh?
Trying to help a prisoner escape.

1250
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,194
Just one more charge against you, Rumpo.

1251
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,119
What do you mean, Marshal?
We just dropped in for a friendly visit, that's all.

1252
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,991
We ain't done nothin' wrong.

1253
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,237
Nothing wrong? Holding up the stage,
cattle-rustling, shooting a Sheriff.

1254
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,036
- You're crazy.
- Don't you believe it.

1255
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,071
I've all the evidence in there, and witnesses.

1256
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:35,028
Don't you try it, Rumpo. Just you try it.

1257
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,197
I'm not a fool, you know.
I know what I'm doing. I'm holding you all.

1258
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:41,033
Right. In there, all of you.

1259
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,116
Go on. And take him with you. Go on, inside.

1260
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,151
You mean, in there?

1261
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,196
Yes. Now, get a move on,
before I lose my temper.

1262
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,028
Well, come on, boys, you heard the Marshal.
Get in there.

1263
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,076
Everybody inside. Come on, move.

1264
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,031
That's the idea.

1265
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,190
You picked the wrong man
to tangle with this time, Rumpo.

1266
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,196
- Now, where's the key?
- Right here.

1267
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,118
- What? Oh.
- And I'll take that, too, I think.

1268
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:06,119
You know, Marshal, you were right.
You're too smart for the likes of us.

1269
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,111
I'm just gonna get out of Stodge City.

1270
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,998
But wait a minute. Come back.

1271
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,156
No, please. Somebody, help!

1272
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,996
(Laughs goofily)

1273
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,031
We've got him for you, Rumpo.

1274
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,155
Bring him in.

1275
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,231
- Big Heap.
- (Grumbles)

1276
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,231
Oop! Ohhh!

1277
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,194
Ahh! Ohh!

1278
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,071
Ooh!

1279
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,232
Confidentially,
Big Heap have heap big hang-um-over.

1280
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,115
Get out of here. Go on home.

1281
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,230
Ohh! Do you mean I'm not a prisoner any more?

1282
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,198
Nope. You can't tell the Marshal
any more than he knows already?

1283
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,156
Get in there.

1284
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,113
Ohh! How absolutely lovely.

1285
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,119
Do you mind? You see,
I've always wanted a scalp with a bobble on.

1286
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,037
Get out of here. Go home.

1287
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,116
Uncivilised lot.

1288
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,989
What is the meaning of this outrage?
Why have I been brought here?

1289
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,189
Shut up. Sit down.

1290
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,073
What are you getting so excited about?

1291
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,073
What am I getting excited about?
Taken from my bed at gunpoint.

1292
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,156
Not even allowed to put my flippers on.

1293
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,994
Have you ever tried riding a horse barefoot?
It hurts.

1294
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,190
It could have been worse.
You might have been in the bath.

1295
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:36,030
Gagged and blindfolded,
with a revoltingly filthy handkerchief.

1296
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,071
I hate to think where that had been.

1297
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:41,078
I couldn't have you knowing
where my hide-out was, could I?

1298
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,032
I don't know what you've got to hide out from,
I'm sure.

1299
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,156
Don't you know what happened in town
last night?

1300
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,151
Somebody ratted on me

1301
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:52,034
and now the Marshal has got more than enough
on me to string me up.

1302
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,153
Oh, really?
Well, I had to go out of town last night.

1303
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,196
We found him at the widow Rawlins' place.

1304
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:03,069
You dirty old man. You're supposed
to be dead against that sort of thing.

1305
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,148
I happen to be her lawyer. Ever since her
husband died, I've been handling everything.

1306
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,037
I bet you have.

1307
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:14,039
This is insufferable.
Why have you brought me here, I say?

1308
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,038
Well, Judge, I'll tell you.
We're gonna make a deal.

1309
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,198
You get rid of that Marshal...
and I will give you a rake-off.

1310
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,998
- A what-off?
- A rake-off.

1311
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,235
A percentage of everything I get
from running Stodge.

1312
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:30,119
Are you attempting to bribe me - a judge,

1313
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:36,156
a dedicated defender of law and order,
a sworn enemy of crime and corruption?

1314
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,151
- Yep.
- How much?

1315
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,156
- A quarter.
- I'll take it.

1316
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,038
Provided you get rid of the Marshal.

1317
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,117
- He ain't really a Marshal at all.
- What?

1318
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:53,151
No. It was all a mistake.
He's really a sanitary engineer. Ha ha!

1319
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,988
Are you trying to tell me -
Johnny Finger, the Rumpo Kid -

1320
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,157
that I have been run out of town by a...

1321
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,037
..plumber?

1322
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,038
Yeah! You can see the funny side of it.

1323
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,149
Shut up!

1324
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,988
The deal's off. I'll take care of him myself.

1325
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,157
I'll fill him so full of holes
they'll use him for straining cabbage.

1326
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,031
Ha ha ha!

1327
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,156
How nice. Well, if you'll excuse me...

1328
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,196
Not so fast. I ain't finished with you yet.

1329
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:23,038
CROWD: We want Knutt!

1330
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:27,119
Patience, folks! Patience! Patience!
He'll be out any minute now.

1331
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,118
Any minute?
You've been saying that since one this morning.

1332
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,999
- We're doing the best we can, Marshal.
- Why are those people out there, anyway?

1333
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,157
Don't you know? You're a hero.
Rumpo and his boys have moved out.

1334
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,118
Some hero. Locked in one of his own cells.

1335
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,112
Teach you to come in here
and ask me for a quick one.

1336
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,073
Hey, Marsh, the Rumpo Kid's got Judge Burke.

1337
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,112
- What are they gonna do to him?
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

1338
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,037
You have to get out of Stodge.

1339
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,992
Get out of Stodge? I can't even get out of here!

1340
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,234
Ok, fellas, just stand aside.

1341
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,151
Gosh, that was marvellous, Annie.

1342
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,193
- I would never have thought of doing that.
- <i>Marshal! Marshal, come quick!</i>

1343
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,033
- What is it?
- Look.

1344
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,196
- It's Judge Burke.
- So it is.

1345
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,038
- Is he...? Is he...?
- No, he ain't.

1346
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,076
Get me off this thing, will you?

1347
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,078
You're OK, Judge.
Just plumb exhausted, that's all.

1348
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,192
So would you be if you'd been riding like this
for four hours,

1349
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,193
with the hot sun beating down
upon your...progress.

1350
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,037
Ohh!

1351
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,229
Ohh!

1352
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,037
What happened to you, Judge?

1353
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,078
Rumpo and his men. They're coming to get you.

1354
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,078
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, they know you're not a real Marshal.

1355
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,078
They're gonna be here
at 12 o'clock high noon.

1356
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,195
High noon? Why high noon?

1357
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,119
I know. I told them it was a most unoriginal time
for that kind of thing.

1358
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:15,197
But they wouldn't listen. Ohh!

1359
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,119
Well, you all heard what the Judge said.

1360
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:23,199
Rumpo and his men,
they'll be coming back to Stodge at 12.

1361
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:29,031
Now, I reckon if we all stand together,
we could...

1362
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,998
Wait. Doc, you'll stand up with me, won't you?

1363
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,191
Well, I'd like to, son, but I'm a kind of busy man.

1364
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,111
Got a lot of calls to make.

1365
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,229
Josh?

1366
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,152
Well, it looks like I'm gonna be
kinda busy myself.

1367
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:46,079
But you don't need to worry.
I already got your measurements.

1368
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,111
It's useless.

1369
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,118
Marshal, you must get out of here.
It's only ten o'clock.

1370
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:55,119
No. I may not be a real Marshal,
but I took this job and I aim to see it through.

1371
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,152
You can't take on Rumpo
and his whole gang single-handed.

1372
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,196
Well, you wouldn't think much of me
if I ran away.

1373
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:04,074
And, anyway, I'm a pretty good shot.
Remember the Indians? Pow!

1374
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:09,035
I never wanted to have to tell you this,
but...it was me that shot those Indians.

1375
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,190
- You?
- Mm-hm. Through the stage window.

1376
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:15,995
Oh. That explains how I managed
to get three with two shots.

1377
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,189
Just a minute.

1378
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,117
(Sniffs)

1379
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:23,199
Oh, yes. And it was you who saved me
from that hanging the other night?

1380
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,189
You'd make some man a good husband.

1381
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,118
Oh, come on. You can't help being what you are.

1382
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,197
But just get out of here. Go back to your drains.

1383
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,112
Yes, that's about all I'm fit for, isn't it? Drains.

1384
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,189
Drains.

1385
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,117
Oh, wait a minute.

1386
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,195
<i>I've got it.</i>

1387
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:44,033
Annie, could you teach me to shoot
as good as you?

1388
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,119
What? They're due in at noon. It's after ten now.

1389
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:51,032
Good. That gives us almost two hours.
Do you think I'm mad?

1390
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,110
Nutty as a fruitcake.

1391
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,235
Agh.

1392
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:03,073
Oh, get off.

1393
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,155
Well, that's a bit better.

1394
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,191
- Any sign of them yet?
- No.

1395
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,191
And there's only a minute to go.

1396
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,995
Oh, is that all?
Doesn't time fly when you're having fun?

1397
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,190
Marsh, please,
you've got to let me go there with you.

1398
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,156
No. Definitely not.

1399
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,192
It's time I started fighting for myself. I told you.

1400
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,111
Yes, I know.

1401
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,031
It's just that I love you.

1402
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,031
(Cuckoos)

1403
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,149
How was that?

1404
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:41,991
Ho ho ho!

1405
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,075
Knutt!

1406
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,036
<i>This is Rumpo!</i>

1407
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,195
I'm coming in!

1408
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,236
Rumpo!

1409
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,069
RUMPO: <i>Knutt.</i>

1410
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,155
Where are you?

1411
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,109
<i>Here, Rumpo!</i>

1412
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,993
Knutt! Where are you?

1413
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,155
<i>Come out and fight, damn you!</i>

1414
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,112
Curly, you take that end.
Slim, you and me take the other.

1415
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,031
Look out behind you!

1416
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,189
Knutt. Where are you?

1417
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,155
Here, Rumpo!

1418
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,196
No, here!

1419
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,234
No, here!

1420
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,116
(Revolvers click)

1421
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,111
Just hold it right there, Rumpo.

1422
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,998
Now...now, Marshal, er, sir.

1423
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,112
You don't want to shoot me.
Me and the boys were only kidding.

1424
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,037
I'm not going to shoot you, Rumpo.

1425
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,156
I'm going to put you where you belong -
on the end of a rope.

1426
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,997
Johnny, I'm coming!

1427
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,036
- Stop, or I'll fire!
- (Revolver clicks)

1428
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,152
Marsh. Oh, Marsh, I think you're wonderful.

1429
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,991
Come here.

1430
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,156
I'd have got him, too,
but I haven't any bullets left.

1431
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,235
(Gunshot)

1432
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,035
Ooh!
