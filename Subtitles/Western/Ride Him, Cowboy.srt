1
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,163
So don't come
back without it.

2
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,721
All right.

3
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,262
We'll get him
when he comes out.

4
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:54,764
Come on.

5
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:25,595
What was that?

6
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,101
Sounds like Duke.

7
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:42,478
That's just why I've got to go

8
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,482
Get back there.

9
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,708
Get out of here.
Take this.

10
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:10,006
Hurry up, boys,
and be careful.

11
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,118
with a horse
that's gone bad.

12
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,122
Granddaddy. You're not
gonna let them kill Duke.

13
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,548
We'll have to abide
by the judge's decision.

14
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,479
over a poor
little horse.

15
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,829
All ready, Your Honor

16
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,030
Oh.

17
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,409
what all this ruckus is about.

18
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,182
Uh, I'd like to
say a word, judge.

19
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,546
Oh, you must believe me.

20
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:28,264
Why, yes. He don't seem
to bother her.

21
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,022
I'm trying this case.

22
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,030
Miss Ruth, I'd keep away
from that horse if I was you.

23
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,222
I am about to pass sentence
in this case.

24
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,795
Just a moment, judge.

25
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:05,528
I'll fine you
for contempt of court.

26
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,434
Shut that gate

27
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,624
He's ready to go.

28
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,852
It's a bet,
Henry.

29
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:07,900
Stay on him!

30
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,660
Foul! He throwed
the horse!

31
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,011
He sure knows
horse flesh, honey.

32
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,425
All right.

33
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,933
Yes they could,
all right.

34
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,847
Because it's a meeting
of the vigilantes.

35
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,473
of this killer and his
gang for good and all?

36
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,366
Maybe he could tell
us how to catch a hawk.

37
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,333
We need 'em.

38
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,938
Sit down, old man. Sit down.

39
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:46,335
now's the time
to speak up.

40
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,259
like to back up his own idea

41
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,850
It's the least
we can do for him.

42
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,040
I'll be on hand.

43
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:38,063
Well, I guess
that's about all.

44
00:16:57,299 --> 00:16:59,301
Well, good luck, Drury.
Thank you.

45
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,451
Thanks.

46
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,992
All right. John.

47
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,136
if he met up
with the Hawk.

48
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,843
Oh, gosh,
I sure love to dance.

49
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,347
Well, why don't
you try it sometime?

50
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:22,110
A birth of a teardrop?

51
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:29,618
The birth of a smile

52
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:45,384
When we meet
In the after a while

53
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,401
Do you wonder that
we're all afraid of him?

54
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,858
I promise to be on guard.

55
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:07,943
I don't think it's right.

56
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,036
What on earth
is Duke up to now?

57
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:39,725
if I know what
Duke's up to.

58
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,823
Well, Duke, would you like
to go Hawk hunting with me

59
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,697
But that settles it.

60
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,645
Don't worry, Ruth,
I won't forget

61
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,535
Bye-bye.
Bye.

62
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,504
All set to go.
Let's go.

63
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,178
We may as well
rest here a while.

64
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,551
Whoa

65
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,644
Huh?

66
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:04,786
Stay here, boy,
and cool off.

67
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,559
You won't be needin'
a guide much longer.

68
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,575
and a dead shot.

69
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,117
with a shootin' iron
yourself, Sims

70
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,677
You can take care of
yourself, all right.

71
00:26:09,684 --> 00:26:12,187
Why, n-no.

72
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:31,206
Well, that's the kind
of shooting I'd like to see.

73
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,305
Come on. Get up.

74
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,346
Go ahead.

75
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,160
Ah. Let's keep back.

76
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,877
Catchin' hawks is
out of your line.

77
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,882
You won't have much use
for this, I reckon.

78
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,857
with old Sol
to keep you company.

79
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,237
Well, you're gonna
play it all by yourself.

80
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,546
food in
your saddlebags...

81
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,583
Just a step away.

82
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:14,976
Adios, amigo.

83
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,543
Oh, here he comes now.

84
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:56,551
He's inside, boss.

85
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,290
Howdy, boss.

86
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,173
All right.
Saddle up, men.

87
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,283
Come on, boy.

88
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,172
Keep it up, boy.

89
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,733
Come on, Duke.

90
00:32:54,756 --> 00:32:55,623
Oh!

91
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:08,770
My boy!

92
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,791
Oh, my boy. Jimmy!

93
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:56,567
But Sims is just the man
I want to see.

94
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:31,219
All right, Grandpa.

95
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:27,742
There. Hm?

96
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,662
Looks like a mouth organ.

97
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,502
Heh.

98
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,172
What's this?

99
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,508
"J.D."

100
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,863
and scour the desert
for John Drury.

101
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,902
Let's go.

102
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,657
Whoa, boys.

103
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:55,613
Come on.

104
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:06,874
Stick'em up!

105
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,413
All right, boys,
let's get goin'.

106
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:14,502
with you now, Ronald?

107
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:25,646
Oh.

108
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,032
Bring him over there.

109
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,414
till after the trial.

110
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,906
And the prisoner will get
every consideration.

111
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,878
Sims?

112
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:07,975
Heh. It's my duty to stay here
and protect this sick man.

113
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,429
the court appoints you
persecutin' attorney.

114
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,384
in plain cow-countryman talk

115
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,118
He sure is.

116
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:15,626
you may proceed.

117
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:38,515
Hey, here he comes now.

118
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:45,906
Oh, look.
Who's this comin'?

119
00:43:50,944 --> 00:43:52,863
Get out of sight, men.

120
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:20,057
Why, uh...

121
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,980
They may be
hanging him now.

122
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,901
Let's ride, men.

123
00:44:58,729 --> 00:44:59,980
when we were
out on the desert.

124
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,232
Objection overruled.

125
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:29,593
unnecessary
and extraneous.

126
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:35,883
Have you got anything furt
her to say for yourself?

127
00:45:37,184 --> 00:45:38,602
That's all.

128
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,531
I forgot.

129
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:13,337
All right, miss.

130
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,985
retire to deliberate.

131
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:29,987
The jury will rise.

132
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,943
And don't spend
too much time arguin'.

133
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:59,883
and you can
recommend hanging.

134
00:47:10,444 --> 00:47:11,895
from hanging
an innocent man.

135
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:18,151
I know John Drury
is innocent, judge.

136
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,415
Henry Sims.

137
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:03,614
I tell you that
Henry Sims is the Hawk

138
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,169
Come on.

139
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,839
Stick'em up.

140
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,261
We got 'em
all covered.

141
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,108
and I'm takin'
company.

142
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:37,397
Keep back, Gaunt.
Let me go. Stop!

143
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,034
Get in there.

144
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:43,820
Get around
that wall there.

145
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:54,881
Duke, come on!

146
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,953
And be sure you're slow
about doin' it.

147
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:48,218
Hold 'em now.

148
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,641
All right.
Come on, boys.

149
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,207
Ronald, wail till I-
Aw, Ronald.

150
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,601
Oh, it's the boss.

151
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,610
Take care of him
on the inside.

152
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,790
Lock that door.

153
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,300
Let me go.

154
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:27,818
Make yourself at
home for a while.

155
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,611
you and I'll be on our way
across the border.

156
00:52:21,087 --> 00:52:22,589
Ronald, come on.
Now, now- What-?

157
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,932
I've ever seen.
Hey.

158
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:36,937
Come on, quick.

159
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:46,613
Now!

160
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:09,336
The boss is in trouble.

161
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,981
A little harder, fellas.

162
00:53:32,492 --> 00:53:34,578
Look out,
John!

163
00:53:43,837 --> 00:53:44,838
Stick 'em up!

164
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:48,174
Get their guns,
boys.

165
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,863
Get back there!

166
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,366
Reach for the ceilin' there!

167
00:54:18,872 --> 00:54:20,323
Go ahead.
