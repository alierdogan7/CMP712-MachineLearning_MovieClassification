NARRATOR:
A thousand miles from El Paso
to the border of Louisiana,

2
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:36,118
1, 000 miles from the gulf
along the winding, colorful
waters of the Rio Grande,

3
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,790
from Mexico to the Panhandle,

4
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,862
Texas,

5
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,764
Across this vast empire
moved first
the shaggy buffalo

6
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,101
and then cattle
in great herds,

7
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,834
raiding red men
and marauding white men,

8
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,806
and later, as the 19th century
was nearing its end,

9
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,006
the settlers who had
established themselves
in this frontier wilderness

10
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,811
were beset by desperadoes
and outlaws,

11
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,250
and it was in order
to make life safe,

12
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,550
to ensure prosperity
and progress,

13
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,216
that, early in the American
occupation of Texas,

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,387
an organization known
as the Texas Rangers
was formed,

15
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,293
Throughout their history,
the Rangers have been men
of exceptional character,

16
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,993
unyielding courage,
rare physical endurance,

17
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,468
Hard riding, fast shooting,

18
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,107
Their service
was to a state they loved,

19
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,735
For an ideal, they were
willing to give up
their lives, and gladly,

20
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:31,009
To the Texas Rangers,
this picture is dedicated,

00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,978
Whoa!

168
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,429
AII right, folks.
You can get out and stretch
your Iegs if you want to.

169
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,966
Thank you.

170
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,415
Hello, stranger.

171
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,715
AIways got room
for one more passenger.

172
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,255
What's the matter with you?
You daffy?

173
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,121
Get up on that seat
and be ready to throw down
that express box.

174
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,059
Who, me?
No, sir, the only time
I was ever Iate

175
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,723
was when one of my mules
threw a shoe.

176
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,165
Don't start nothing now.
Get in that stagecoach
and sit tight.

177
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,431
I'II explain to you Iater.

178
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,807
You'II explain nothing.
Get up on that seat.

179
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,266
That man up there,
riding with me...

180
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,178
Hey, driver, you've watered
those mules Iong enough.
Let's get moving.

181
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,274
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Right away. Yes, sir.

182
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,082
I'II have you
in Junction City in
no time at all, my friend.

183
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,921
Come right in here.
AII aboard, folks.

184
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,154
Wait a minute. I ain't riding
in this shoe box.

185
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,664
$3.60, right to the penny.

186
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,560
Get in. Get in.

187
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,518
Come on, boys.
Get going.

188
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,579
What a day!
What a day, neighbor,

189
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,115
just to be alive.
I feel so good
I think I'II sing a song.

190
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,320
Would you Iike
to hear me sing?

191
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,885
I don't care for music.

192
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,797
It's your Ioss, my friend.
I think I'II sing anyway.

193
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:19,064
(SINGING OH SUSANNA)

194
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,799
Come on there, Jasper!

195
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,739
Bang!

196
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,837
Leave the gentleman's gun be!

197
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,973
Mustn't touch things
Iike that.

198
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,540

199

(GUN FIRING)

200
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,506
That's what I was trying
to tell you. Texas Rangers.

201
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,477
Texas Rangers, huh?

202
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,278
If that's
the way they work,
I'm gonna stay clear of 'em.

203
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,146
They got
no sense of humor.

204
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,018
I motion we adjourn
to the nearest saloon

205
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,180
and talk over
this episode at Iength.

206
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,281
I second the motion.

207
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,802
JIM AND WAHOO:
Therefore, as a member
of the Ranger Force of Texas,

208
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,804
I do solemnly swear...

209
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:30,069
To make the peace
and preserve Iaw and order.

210
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,804
BOTH: To make the peace
and preserve Iaw and order.

211
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,709
To the best
of my ability.

212
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,839
BOTH:
To the best of my ability.

213
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,350
AII this to the end

214
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:43,320
that the State of Texas
may be a safe place
in which to Iive.

215
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,721
BOTH: AII this to the end
that the State of Texas

216
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,453
may be a safe place
in which to Iive.

217
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,690
So help me God.

218
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,523
Well?

219
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,191
BOTH: So help me God.

220
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,569
Sign right here.

221
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:11,105
We don't ask
too many questions
when a man joins the Rangers.

222
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,449
Courage, a good head
and a better aim,

223
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,749
that's about all
that's required.

224
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,752
Those men died
with their boots on,

225
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,721
not for the small wage
they receive,

226
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,529
but for an ideal,

227
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,162
the determination to make
this state a civilized place
in which to Iive,

228
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,706
and so, Hawkins, Jones,

229
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,768
you enter into a service
which holds a fine heritage.

230
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,645
If you're worth
two hoops in Hades,
it'II bring it out of you.

231
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,083
If you're not,
it'II bring that out, too.

232
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,154
Fair enough.

233
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,753
Oh, here's
some regulations you boys
better be Iooking over.

234
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,060
That's all, boys.

235
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,532
Hiya, Ranger.

236
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,579
He doesn't know it yet,
but he's got a couple
of star boarders

237
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,582
for the rest of his Iife,
the old buzzard.

238
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:23,114
Look, hard head, there's
a Iot more to this job than
40 bucks a month and chuck,

239
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,348
a Iot more.

240
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,391
You tell me.
I'm all ears.

241
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,518
I can't tell you just yet.
I gotta figure it out first,

242
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,426
but Iisten,

243
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,958
there ain't a game
in this world
that wasn't made to be beat

244
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,831
if you're dealing the cards.

245
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,235
AII right, my proud beauty,
when you get around to it,
deal me in, will you?

246
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,536
Meantime, I'II take
these rules and regulations

247
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,473
and put 'em
next to my heart.

248
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,205
Don't Iet it
worry you, son.

249
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:56,686
"Rangers are instructed
to return all stolen cattle
to their rightful owner.

250
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,821
"When a Ranger
is assigned to protect
a shipment of gold..."

251
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:10,758
And hen I meet a stagecoach
How happy I would feel

252
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,929
How happy I would feel

253
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,405
How happy I would feel

254
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,035
Hey, boy, put a Iittle
sow butter in them beans.
I'm kind of hungry today.

255
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,541
"To make Texas a safe place
to Iive in."

256
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,413
What's the matter, Ranger?
What are you so happy about?

257
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,851
Hey, Walrus,
did you ever see this one?

258
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,489
Fake Iow, catch you
with the backhand.
Never misses.

259
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,355
Oh, boy! A hammock!

260
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,428
Say, I think
I'II take me a nap.

261
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,023
Call me
when dinner's ready, friend.

262
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,799
In my time,
you had to be a man
to join the Rangers.

263
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,733
Hey, anybody home?
Just want to use the hammock.

264
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,802
Rules and regulations.

265
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,648
I never had no pocket change

266
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,512
I thought that hardly fair

267
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:06,750
Way up on the highway
I met a stagecoach there

268
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,019
Peeking!

269
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,589
Hey, you new men,

270
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
get your horses.
We're going out.

271
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,395
Who? Me?

272
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,768
Yes, both of you.

273
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,076
Where you going?
We ain't ate yet.

274
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,772
Never mind that.
Mount your horses.

275
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,214
I ain't been here
for five minutes,

276
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,310
and he wants
to go out riding.

277
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,851
We've been riding for days.

278
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,851
Oh, the big mallet head!

279
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,520

You certainly get
some great ideas.

281
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,699
You're still a Iittle punchy
from bouncing around
on those stagecoaches.

282
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,472
Oh, yeah?

283
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,869

I want to get in
a couple of wing shots.

303

Throw up your own hat.
I'm not gonna get
sunstroke for you.

304
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,566
I don't know why they sent
you along anyway. I can handle
all them rustlers myself.

305
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,505
Ha! I'II nail
more rustlers than you.
Bet you two bits.

306
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,542
I'II take that bet.
Want to pay me now?

307
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,304
I wouldn't pay you
even if I had two bits.

I was only fooling.

314
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,966
I got a better idea.
I'II circle them and come in
on the other side.

315
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,135
You go down
and head 'em off
at the river.

316

That ain't
such a good idea.

317
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,544
You're in the back.
I'm down front where
they can shoot at me. Oh, no.

AII right, I'II head 'em off,
and you circle 'em.

319
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,986
AII right.
Wait a minute.

320
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,747

want to head 'em off?

Well, sure...
It's mighty kind of you,
Miss, but...

503
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,457
No buts about it.
You will stay.

504
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,293
Smells mighty fine,
that ham does.

505
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,164
If you don't stay
and help us eat it,
we'II have ham for a week.

quartered our horses yet.

back of that invitation?

522
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,087
Yeah, good eating.

I've stayed clear

What's the matter
with her kind?

525

She's the home-building,

to Fort Worth.

542
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:33,406
They asked for a man
to go the whole way
just to act as chaperon.

544
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:38,240

we're the best Rangers

it Iooks mighty important.

Anything serious?

553
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,456
I thought the Indian trouble
had been settled
once and for all.

554
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,355

it's to break out again.

is to be a state,

are to build homes,

00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:10,338
I'd already made up my mind
to give it to you and Gillis.

669
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,807
If you don't mind,
I'd Iike to handle it myself.

670
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,781
I got some ideas of my own.
That is, if it's all right
with you, Jake.

671
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,789
You're biting off
a pretty big chaw,
but I reckon...

672
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,347
Thanks, Jake.

673
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,318
Well, Major, what about it?

674
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,021
Seems to be all settled,

675
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:29,588
but no gunplay unless
it's absolutely necessary.

676
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,302
Here are some
Kimball County reports
you can Iook over.

00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,564
Thanks.

678
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,834
Weren't you afraid for him
when he started up
the canyon wall?

679
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,504
No, he was in
the softest spot of all.

680
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:43,943
I had him covered
all the time.

681
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,847
He didn't have a thing
to be worried about.

682
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,680
Between me and you,
I was the real hero.

683
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,849
Why didn't you go
all the way with Jim?

684
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,852
I wanted to,
but that dang foot
stopped me.

685
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,123
It would have
stopped anybody.

686
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:05,793
If it wasn't for Jim,
you and the Major
wouldn't be here, would you?

687
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,133
The way you talk, you'd think
Jim whipped that bunch
of Indians by himself.

688
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,903

I never shot so fast

Sure thing.

You Iike everything
about me, don't you?
Answer me.

837
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:50,559
Aw, Jim, why don't
you face the truth,
Iike me?

838
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,158
What truth?

839
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,497
That we Iove each other.

840
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,662
Oh, that's nonsense.

841
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:55,761
It's not.

842
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,366
It's beautiful, our Iove,
the way it happened.

843
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,902
It's all the more beautiful
because we didn't go after it.

844
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,844
Jim, it just happened.

845
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,983
Oh. Say,
don't you believe in Iove?

846
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,076
No.

847
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,415
But you do Iove me?

848
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:12,714
No.

849
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:15,087
But don't you know I Iove you?

850
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,182
No.

851
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:18,852
Do you?

852
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:22,728
Jim, I do.
I do, and I mean
every word I said.

853
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,690
You made me say it.

854
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,601
Oh! Jim.

What can I do for you?

880
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,527
I got a murder warrant here

(COUGHING)

882
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,635

I said, Jess Higgins.
You must've heard of him.

Jess Higgins, yes.

Yeah, well...

887
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:20,777
Who issued this warrant?

888
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,841
The Sheriff here,
at the request
of the Texas Rangers.

889
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:28,152
Uh-huh. Well, was this
a blanket warrant
or any particular killing?

890
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,317
It's for the murder
of the Hartford brothers.

891
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,883

this afternoon.

Nobody's asking you
to do it in a minute.
You got a whole hour.

Uh-huh.

896
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,600
My dear Twitchell,

897
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,300
may I presume
on your hospitality

898
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,968
to the extent
of three fingers of rye?

899
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,204
I've had atrocious Iuck
at the hands
of Lady Fortune.

900
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,042
Never saw so many
small cards in my Iife.

901
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,946
Why, certainly, Judge.

902
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:57,578
I want you to meet Mr. Hawkins
of the Texas Rangers.
Judge Snow.

903
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,121
PIeasure, sir.
How do you do?

904
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:00,246
If you're Iooking
for justice,

905
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,757
you've sure come
to the right place.

906
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:06,124
Hawkins here
holds a murder warrant
for Jess Higgins.

907
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:11,265
What'd you give me?
I asked for rye,
not coal oil.

908
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,961
We're holding court
in an hour.

909
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,731
You're officiating
on the bench.

910
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,897
Why... Why, yeah.
Of course. I...

911
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,600
I'd be mighty proud
to do so,

912
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,075
but the courthouse
has been abandoned,

913
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,339
used for a storehouse
for years.

914
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,314
Fact is, it's full
of green hides right now.

915
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:30,018
I might add,
Mr. Higgins' hide, so...

916
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:31,451
Yeah.
Yeah.

917
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,853
Well, what's the matter
with this place?

918
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,357
This ought to make
a good courthouse.

919
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:39,159
Judge, your bench
will be right there,
in back of the bar.

920
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:42,220
We'II twist
the roulette table around,
the jury can sit there.

921
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,267
The prosecution can sit
at the stud table there,
the defense back there.

922
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,063
And where do I sit?

923
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,704
Hear you got a warrant
for my arrest.
You Higgins?

924
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,270
Let's have it.

925
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,417
Brought my Iawyer along
to see that everything
comes off Iegal-Iike.

926
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,148
You don't mind, do you?

927
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,689
No, the more, the merrier.

928
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,418
You know, I never been
in court before.

929
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:12,321
Ought to be
kind of interesting.

930
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,521
Yeah, it ought to.

931
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,225
Let's have a drink
on that.
You bet.

932
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,823
Yeah. Yes, sir.

933
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:22,135
You, too, Ranger.
No, I gotta go dig up
one first-class witness.

934
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,770
Casper Johnson,
now, it has come
to my attention

935
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,643
that you publicly stated

936
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:35,582
that you saw Higgins
enter into the Iivery stable
on the afternoon in question.

937
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,879
Now, is that so?

938
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:39,649
Dave, that ain't fair
to put me on the spot
Iike this.

939

TWITCHELL: Your honor,

940
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,448
I insist you make the witness
stop beating around the bush.

941
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,427
Oh, he's a bit confused,
but he's doing
the best he can.

942
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:48,191
Yes or no, Casper?

943
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,357
Well, I was up in the Ioft,

944
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,525
but you can't see good
from there,

945
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,935
and I had a fork full
of hay at the time.

946
01:02:56,005 --> 01:03:00,567
Never mind that. Did you
or did you not see Higgins
go into the Iivery stable?

947
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:05,907
Well, it's nearly a year ago.
I've... My memory
ain't so good anymore.

948
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,640
My wife said to me
only yesterday, "Casper..."

JUDGE: Order!

952
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:15,885
Now, Iook here, Casper,
murder is
a pretty serious business.

953
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,685
Unless you can state
positively

954
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,491
that Higgins is the man
that entered the Iivery stable
and shot the Hartford boys,

955
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,498
you'd better get down
off that stand.

956
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,431
That's a good idea, Judge.

957
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,493
I shouldn't have come here
in the first place.

958
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:32,699
Far be it from me
to convict an innocent man,

959
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:36,375
so, if you don't mind,
I'II just toddle along.

960
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,276
Just a minute, Judge.

961
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,073
I wanna ask the witness
a couple of questions.

962
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,981
TWITCHELL:
This is most irregular.
You can't do that!

963
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:45,316
Who says I can't?
Get up there.

964
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,751
Casper, I'm advising you
to tell the truth

965
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,555
'cause if you don't,
your address is gonna be

966
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,891
the state prison
in Huntsville.

967
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,590
Now answer direct,
yes or no.

968
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:00,198
You saw the defendant,
Jess Higgins shoot and kill
Dick Hartford, didn't you?

969
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,328
Well...
Come on!
You did, didn't you?

970
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,373
I merely thought that...
Yes!

971
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,671
Yes.
Say, who's running
this court?

972
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,870
I am, from now on.
Sit down.

973
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,547
Then Fred Hartford
came in the stable,

974
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,776
and Higgins shot
and killed him, didn't he?

975
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,978
Well, in a way...
Didn't he?

976
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,281
Yes!
Yes.

977
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,380
That's all, Casper.
Thanks.

978
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,216
Whew!

979
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,389
The court has heard
all the witnesses
it needs to hear.

980
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,326
Right.
Sum up, Mr. Twitchell.

981
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,597
Gentlemen, it's up to you
to bring in a verdict.

982
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,692
A just verdict!
Conviction!

983
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:37,203
Now, if Mr. Higgins is guilty,
he should be punished,

984
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,742
but no one but Casper Johnson
saw the shootings.

985
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:44,975
Now, we have here
the rather incoherent story

986
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,016
of a man who affirms,
then denies,

987
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,382
then affirms
that he saw the killings.

988
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,478
It seems to me
he shouldn't be
a witness at all!

989
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:57,515
Therefore, we don't want
to hang or send to jail
an innocent man,

990
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,187
so you must weigh
the evidence
very carefully.

(CLEARING THROAT)

992
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:05,062
There is only one verdict.
You know it as well as I do.

993
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:06,999
Forget what
the prosecuting attorney
just said.

994
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,093
I object!

995
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,967
Sit down and shut up!

996
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,373
There's only one way
to clean up a county
Iike Kimball.

997
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,637
Get rid of men
Iike Higgins for good.

998
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,269
If you don't respect
your own courts of Iaw,

999
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:19,541
you'II never get rid
of Iawlessness.

and to make homes.

01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,970
Hawkins, you're under arrest.

1169
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,132
What for?

1170
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,267
The Polka-Dot Bandit
and Sam McGee
are one and the same.

1171
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,777
Not so Iong ago,
you were outlaws together.

1172
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,178
You were
and you still are pals.

1173
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:58,350
You're not hiding anything
from me, Hawkins.

1174
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,054
How Iong
have you known this?

1175
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,861
It came while you were
in Kimball County.

1176
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,194
I don't mind telling you
it was hard for me
to believe it.

1177
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:19,502
This was to have been
your real test,
bringing in Sam McGee.

1178
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,968
I hoped
you'd come through.

1179
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:31,749
I'm sorry, sir.

1180
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,014
So am I.

1181
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,350
Let's go.

1182
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,459
Hello, Davey.
I said, hello.

1183
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,099
Oh, Iook what
I got for you.

1184
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,165
Some Iicorice.

1185
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,750
Say, I oiled up my gun.

1186
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,145
Sure works good.

1187
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,816
You wanna try it?

1188
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,023
What's the matter with you?

1189
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,186
Nothing.

1190
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,764
Oh. Thinking
about Jim, huh?

1191
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:22,970
Supposing I am?

1192
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,165
Say, Jim ain't a-scared
of that Polka-Dot.

1193
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,505
None of the Rangers
around here are.
I know I ain't.

1194
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,304
I was wondering.

1195
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,471
Well, I ain't.

1196
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:36,748
Seems if you was
a good Ranger, the Major
would've given you the job.

1197
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:40,044
Sent three or four
other fellows,
but he didn't send you.

1198
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,180
Is that so?

1199
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,952
Well, it ain't gonna do
him no good, 'cause
he ain't gonna find him.

1200
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:48,087
It's gonna take brains
to ferret out that Polka-Dot.
Yes, sir, brains.

1201
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,755
I'II bet you
I could find him.

1202
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,594
I'm from Missouri, Wahoo.

1203
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,897
Say, Davey,
supposing I went out
and got the Polka-Dot

1204
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,669
and brought him in here,

1205
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,232
would you be
proud of me?

1206
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:03,777
You know I would.

1207
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,170
Everybody'd be proud of you.

1208
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,115
Why, you'd be
the biggest Ranger
of 'em all,

1209
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,542
even bigger than Jim was.

1210
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:13,578
That settles it.

1211
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:14,713
Honest?

1212
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,814
Honest Injun.

1213
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:17,984
You're gonna take me along
with you, ain't you?

1214
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,049
Don't be daffy.

1215
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,958
It's bad enough
me going without
the Major's orders.

1216
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,395
They find out I'm missing,
things'II be popping.

1217
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,296
They won't miss me, either,
till it's too Iate.

1218
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,629
What are you talking about?

1219
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:30,035
You'II slow me down.
Besides, Polka-Dot
is a pretty tough hombre,

1220
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,595
I gotta figure out a way
to bring him in.

1221
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:33,140
Maybe you'd better not go.

1222
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,575
I'm one of the finest
trigger men in this country.

1223
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:40,307
This is gonna be
between me and you,
understand? Man to man.

1224
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,974
Man to man.
Shake.

1225
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,711
Be a good boy now.

1226
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:47,621
You're gonna be
awful careful,
aren't you, Wahoo?

1227
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,054
What do you mean, son?

1228
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:50,182
Well...

1229
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:55,093
Oh. Don't you worry none.
Nothing's gonna happen
to old Wahoo. You know that.

1230
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,327
Be a good boy.
Stick up your hands!

1231
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,493
Gotcha!
So Iong, Davey.
Yup.

1232
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,556

(SINGING OH SUSANNA)

01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,377
Wahoo! Hey, Wahoo!

1235
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,278
Holy horse cars! You!

1236
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,347
What are you doing here?

1237
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,478
I been following you all day.

1238
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,022
You have, huh?

1239
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:58,751
Well, turn around
and get home as fast
as that nag'II take you.

1240
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,089
I am not.

1241
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,592
Listen, Davey,
I told you
this is a man's job.

1242
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:05,292
I'm a man.
You said, "Man to man."

1243
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,598
Besides, if you got
in a tight spot,
I could go for help.

1244
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:11,537
Don't worry about me.
I ain't gonna get
in no tight spots, either.

1245
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,097
Now get home
as fast as you can,
understand me?

1246
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,041
Go on. Get out of here.

1247
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,241
Get out of here!
Scat!

1248
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,047
I mean it!
I said get out of here!

1249
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,743
Oh, all right.

1250
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,384
You wanted
to send a message,

1251
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:32,688
you wouldn't have anybody
to send it with
unless you took me along.

1252
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,388
Maybe so,
but I'd have a tougher time

1253
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,054
explaining what you
was doing with me.

1254
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:39,464
Well, you could say
you saved me
from the Injuns.

1255
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,500
That was a Iong time ago.

1256
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:45,506
But you don't have
to tell them that, do you?

1257
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,039
Davey, come here.

1258
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,382
Dadblast your Iittle hide!

a head on your shoulders.

Someday you're gonna be
a big Iawyer, I bet you.

1261

Six of clubs.
That's all I needed.

01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,864
You beat it!
Yeah, I beat it!

1268
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:21,866
You know,
that makes me sore.

1269

That's something
I never been able to do.

1270
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:28,007
Ah, Sam,
I gotta hand it to you
for getting along so well.

1271
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:32,744
Simply because
I got nerve, imagination
and a steady hand.

1272
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,584
Huh!
Don't I know it.

What?

1275
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:38,920
I wouldn't be
a bit surprised

if people
was writing books about me
20 years from now.

Listen, you're
famous already.

You can't pick up
a newspaper, you don't see
something about you.

01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,697
No.
Yeah. You think
I'm fooling?

1281
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,874
Stay here.
I'II show you.

Look, take this note
to the telegraph operator
in town,

and tell him to send it
to Major Bailey right away.

didn't you?

1335
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:50,006
That's right.
Uh-huh.

1336
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:56,977
You sure that you didn't want
the boys and me
to change places with Jim?

1337
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:03,315
Looks Iike you got me, Sam.

1338
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,682
But I'II Iay my cards
out on the table.
I'II shoot straight.

1339
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,784
So will I.

1341
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:17,696

to do that, Sam?

1343
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:30,508

Ed!

1347
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,428
He's headed off
into the hills!

1348
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:22,163
They got Wahoo!
Hold the horse!

1349

Major Bailey!
Oh, Major!

1350

Major!

1351
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:29,269
Major!

1352
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,737
What's the trouble, Neal?

1353
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,240
Here's a note.

1354
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,712
"This is what I think
of the Rangers.

1355

"Better keep out of my way,
or I'II kill the kid.

1356
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:49,885
"P.S. Jim,
I'm sending Wahoo back

1357

"so that you can give him
a first-class funeral.

1358

"Sorry I can't attend
in person. Sam."

1359
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:58,769
That's the rottenest thing
I ever saw.

1360
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,705
Rotten?
It's cold-blooded murder.

1361
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,140
EIIiot! Russell! Grayson!

1362
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,405
You three start pronto
for EI Paso.

1363
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:05,946
Get in touch
with the Sheriff there.

1364

We're on our way, sir.

Yes, sir.

1371

What is it, Hawkins?

1374
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:31,130
You've got
to release me, Major.

1375
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,571
Release me
until I can get McGee.

1376

You've got to, Major!

1377
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:37,575
How do I know
you don't mean
to join McGee?

1378
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,374
I give you my word!

1379
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:41,709
AII right.

1380
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,614
Bob, open it up.

1381

Yes, and it
won't fail you.

Jim! Hello.

1386
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,109
I'm so happy to see you.

1387
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:48,909
Is Sam here?

1388
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,185
Oh, Sammy? You know him.

1389
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:54,679
He will not be back
for maybe a month, I think.

1390
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:05,563
Where's Davey?

1391
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:08,158
Davey?
I don't know, Jim.

1392
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,033
He go away yesterday.

1393
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,705
Oh, he did.

1394
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:26,212
Davey.

1395
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:27,579
Jim!

1396
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:30,883
Open the door.

1397
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,255
I have not the key.

1398
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:33,623
I knew you'd come, Jim!

1399
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,754
I'II have you out of there
in a minute, Davey.

1400
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:38,797
What you do?

1401
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,334
Maria!

1402
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:49,966
You stay here!

1403
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:51,101

I'm glad to see you!

I'm glad
to see you, Davey.

1407
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,002
Where's Wahoo?

1408
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:23,043
Well, Davey, I'II tell you
about Wahoo Iater.

01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,040
Hello, Sam.

1411
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,846
Keep 'em up, Jim.

1412
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:33,784
Get back in the room,
and shut the door, Davey.

1413
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:34,913
I wanna stay
with you, Jim.

1414
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,013
Do as I tell you.

1415
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:43,325
Maria, get his guns.

1416
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:49,025
Haven't you heard
that a Ranger
never gives up his guns?

1417
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,395
I got the drop on you, kid.

1418
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,569
I see you have,
but it ain't gonna do you
any good.

1419
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:57,805
You mean I have to kill you
standing there Iike that?

1420
01:31:57,879 --> 01:31:59,779
Not till I've killed you.

1421
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,839
You're all through, Sam.
You're all washed up.

1422
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,049
There ain't no more room
for your kind in Texas.

1423
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,155
I always Iiked you, Jim.

1424
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:10,680
You, too, Sam.

1425
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:12,884
Why'd you kill Wahoo?

1426
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,121
Killing was too good for him.

1427
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:17,493
I'II say for you,
you state your case plain.

1428
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:19,590
I'II state it plain again.

1429
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:23,802
I quit the Ranger service
because I didn't wanna go
out after you.

1430
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,668
Wahoo took my place.

1431
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,031
But I'm not quitting now.

1432
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,473
Either you come along
with me peaceable,

1433
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:32,876
or I'm gonna kill you
Iike you killed Wahoo.

1434
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:40,450
Ah, Jim, you always was
the craziest maverick
I ever did know.

1435
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:43,581
You stand there
talking about killing me.

1436
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,421
AII I gotta do is
press my finger,

1437
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:48,053
and I blow you
right through that door.

1438
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:50,290
That don't mean nothing, Sam.

1439
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:51,456
Soon as I hear a shot,

1440
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:54,524
I'm gonna pull both my guns
and start pumping Iead
into you as fast as I can.

1441
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,232
Hey, Jim,

1442
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:02,398
remember that gal
I took away from you
in Saint Louis, huh?

1443
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:03,534
Arabella?

1444
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:06,011
Yeah, Arabella.
Remember?

1445
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:08,907
I'II tell you what I'II do.

1446
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:11,114
Maria here,
she's a great gal.

1447
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:13,779
She's a good cook.
She's on the Ievel.

1448
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,055
Me and the boys
have been thinking about
moseying out California Way

1449
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:21,254
for a Iong time.
I'II promise you.
We'II get out. We'II stay out.

1450
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:25,129
I've made a good stake.
You'II get your cut
as usual,

1451
01:33:27,702 --> 01:33:29,795
and I'm Ieaving Maria
behind me.

1452
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:33,833
Come on, now,
what do you say?

1453
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:37,933
I say you'd better
put away those guns
and come with me.

1454
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:40,314
I don't want to kill you!

1455
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:55,890
Drop your gun, Sam!

1456
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,955
I'II kill you!
So help me, I'II kill you!

1457
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:46,270
Jim?

1458
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:49,979
Jim, quit following me,
or so help me,
I'II kill you!

1459
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:52,986
I'II kill you sure as
a rattler throws poison!

1460
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,101
Listen, Sam!

1461
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:12,137
There might be
some chance for you
if you Iet me take you in!

1462
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:48,974
Sam, either
you come out of there
with your hands up,

1463
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:51,835
or I'm coming in
after you!

1464
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:07,391
AII right,

1465
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:11,424
here I come!

1466
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:15,766
(COUGHING)

1467
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:38,358
Well, Sam,
it had to be either you or me,
and I guess you Iost.

1468
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:49,626
I hope maybe you
Iet him in up there.

1469
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:53,070
He just got on
the wrong train.
That's all.

1470
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:58,835
Henry V. Jones,

1471
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:02,104
whom we affectionately
called Wahoo,

1472
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,307
died bravely.

1473
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:07,949
His final home
shall be close to us here

1474
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:11,523
and to the service
that he had come to Iove.

1475
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,452
Jones vindicated
his errors,

1476
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:19,422
and I say that
the soil of Texas shall be
all the more fertile

1477
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:23,870
for the blood he shed
to the benefit of those
who come after him.

1478
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:28,273
The men who have died
for Texas have not died
in vain,

1479
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:31,673
Unsung though their names
may be in future years,

1480
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:36,476
it shall be known
that in the turbulent years
of a state's transformation,

1481
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:39,784
it was their deeds
of individual sacrifice,

1482
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:42,318
their acts
of dauntless courage,

1483
01:37:42,823 --> 01:37:46,054
that made possible
the changing
of a lawless frontier

1484
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,258
into a civilized land,

1485
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:52,160
These are the men
called Texas Rangers,

1486
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,898
molded in the crucible
of heroic struggle,

1487
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:58,795
guardians of the frontier,

1488
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:02,872
makers of the peace,
