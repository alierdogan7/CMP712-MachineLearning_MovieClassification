2
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,300
-You the railroad agent?
-l am.

3
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,574
l'm Sheriff McCullough.

4
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,921
Sure is a cold one tonight.

5
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,206
Anything wrong, Sheriff?

6
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,536
Nothing l can't handle.

7
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,664
lf you gentlemen are finished
with your business...

8
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,598
l need to get this train
out of here.

9
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,364
lt's up the Sheriff.

10
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,101
lf you think there's gonna be
trouble, we'll hang on awhie.

11
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,196
No need.

12
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,735
Friendly cuss, ain't he?

13
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,782
Jack, the Sheriff.

14
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,423
Get the bag.

15
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,320
Get the money bag.

16
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,935
Come on!

17
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,333
What happened, Ben?

18
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,038
Shilogh, come on.

19
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,731
He ain't got no face no more.

20
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,941
Pick him up.

21
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,692
-Pick him up and drag him...
-What for, Ben? He's dead.

22
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,683
Drag him to the end
of the train, let's go.

23
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,459
Do what l tell you Jackass.
Let's go.

24
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,691
Get him in there. Get in.

25
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,195
Get in.

26
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,553
What's the matter, John?

27
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,597
l heard a shotgun blast.
Damn fool drifters.

28
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,068
You're the damn fool.
Get back into bed.

29
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,336
Ain't gonna change the world...

30
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,738
if a few drunken cowboys out
having a good time.

31
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,207
You know the boys can raise
hell all they want to...

32
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,938
but not at this hour of
the morning, and not in my town.

33
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,247
Now, you stay right
where you're at...

34
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,415
my little desert flower...

35
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,384
because l Just ain't quite
finished with you yet.

36
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,722
And this shouldn't take long,
l'll be right back.

37
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,153
Now, ma'am, everything's
gonna be all right.

38
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,796
-What's going on here?
-Been a holdup, Marshall.

39
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,897
-Paradise payroll?
-Yep.

40
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,373
-Where's Sheriff McCullough?
-Over there.

41
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,332
Took a shotgun blast full on,
about took his head clean of.

42
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,900
My God, Will.

43
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,904
Have a couple of this boys
take him over to the undertakes.

44
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,782
Teel him to put Sheriff in a box
and nail the lid down.

45
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,751
Wouldn't do to have his wife
see him looking like this.

46
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,543
l'll take care of it, Marshall.

47
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,947
Thank you.

48
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,860
Marshall. Marshall.
Look here.

49
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,800
Look over here.

50
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,317
-Look here.
-Well, it looks three horses.

51
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,353
Does that fit?
Were there three of them?

52
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,650
That's all l saw.

53
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,158
Three drifters in the saloon
last night.

54
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,755
l knew they were up to no good.

55
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,132
Well, one of them
ain't too healthy anymore.

56
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,124
That lady cracked his skull
open for him real proper.

57
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,361
Well, good, maybe that'll slow
them down a little bit.

58
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,766
Looks like they went south
right out into the prairie.

59
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,078
Ain't no place for a man
to hide out there.

60
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,050
Bill, get the boys together,
get them saddled up...

61
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,746
-meet me in front of the Jail.
-Will do, Marshall.

62
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,781
All right.

63
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,888
Marshall, do you need to hold
the train here any longer?

64
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,163
You can take her on
down the tracks.

65
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,596
Thank you, sir.

66
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,099
Sure hope you catch
those three, Marshall.

67
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,300
Will McCullough
was a friend of mine.

68
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,547
You're not one of the girls
from the saloon.

69
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,412
Where you from? Who are you?

70
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,993
lf you don't mind my asking...

71
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,826
what are you doing out here
at this hour of the morning...

72
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,891
dressed like that?

73
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,439
l've got a lady friend
up at the saloon...

74
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,464
who'll look after you
until l get back.

75
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,545
-We'll look after her, Marshall.
-Thank you. You'll be alright.

76
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,178
That was a brave thing you did.

77
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,527
All right, boys,
let's get after them.

78
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,872
Well, boys, it looks like
we've been made fools of.

79
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,782
Where you reckon they are?

80
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,449
Well, my guess they're
on that damn train.

81
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,448
What are we gonna do now?

82
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,128
Well, we'll get
on the telegraph.

83
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,029
Ain't no place they can get off
before Rock Springs.

84
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,563
We'll set up a nice
warm welcome for them.

85
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:39,163
Charlie, run those horses
back to town. Let's go.

86
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,067
When we gonna get
to a town, Ben?

87
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,773
Tonight, l figure.

88
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,650
What'd we bring him along for?

89
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:58,655
Three men robbed a payroll,
three horses rode out of town.

90
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,796
-Jack's dead, Ben.
-Yeah, but they don't know that.

91
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,458
And it's gonna take them forever
to figure it out.

92
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,428
She sure did make
a mess out of him.

93
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,800
Well, you know what,
let's get rid of him right now.

94
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,937
Grab his legs.

95
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:26,249
When l say three.
One, two, three.

96
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,757
Well, that was
a nice thing you did, Ben.

97
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,928
What are you talking about?

98
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:40,490
You Just provide Christmas dinner
for a whole bunch of buzards.

99
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:24,968
Sleep in heavenly peace

100
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:40,153
Sleep in heavenly peace

101
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,216
Well, mister Sam.

102
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,749
Looks like we found us
a dead man.

103
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,329
Saints be praised...

104
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,638
looks like we found us
a rich dead man.

105
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,251
What we gonna do about this?

106
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,389
What'd you reckon
he'd be doing...

107
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,363
if he was standing here
looking down at me?

108
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,591
Yeah, you're probably right.

109
00:13:58,737 --> 00:13:59,931
Still...

110
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:06,106
a merciful man doeth good
to his own soul.

111
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,569
lt's all right.

112
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,041
Tell you what,
my name is Joshua. All right.

113
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,050
And there'll be plenty of time
for talking...

114
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,881
when you're feeling
a little better.

115
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,713
Just calm down.
Just go on back to sleep.

116
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,681
There you go.

117
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,796
Well, mister Sam...

118
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,136
looks like our dead man's
gonna make it after all.

119
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,001
Thank you, Lord.

120
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,057
You remember anything?

121
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,331
Your name?

122
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,659
lt's yours.

123
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,761
Fell out of one of your boots.

124
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,266
That's a lot of money for
a dead man to be carrying around.

125
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,972
Last stop that train made
was Jericho...

126
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,777
wild little town
up in the mountains.

127
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,507
l'll Just call you that,
for the time being.

128
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,250
lf you don't mind.

129
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,953
Closest town to here is
a place called Silver City.

130
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,668
Soon as you fit to ride,
we'll head up there.

131
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:21,230
You can buy yourself
some decent clothes...

132
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,136
and get yourself a horse.

133
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:27,901
Here you go.

134
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,483
Well, least ways
it's place to start.

135
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,084
Here's your money.

136
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,185
They probably got
better food, too.

137
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,188
You boys sure you got
everything you need?

138
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,157
Yes, sir. l believe we do.
He's looking a little better now.

139
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,717
-Well, you all have a good day.
-Thank you, sir. Apprecite it.

140
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,760
Would hurry up, man.

141
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,033
lf l had any help from you,
l might do a little faster.

142
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,969
Yeah, well, the good Lord
helps those who help themselves.

143
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,402
Let's go get a drink.

144
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,363
Alright, Just a moment.

145
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,176
Well, what's taking you so long?

146
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,115
Get out of our way, boy.

147
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,277
Something wrong
with your hearing?

148
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,890
lf you ain't aiming
to get yourself killed...

149
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,159
you better get out of your way.

150
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,756
'Cause we ain't never in our lives,
stepped aside for a pole-cat.

151
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,869
No problem.
'Cause l always do.

152
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,645
Looks like he never missed
a meal in his whole life either.

153
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,448
You're right,
lets go get a drink.

154
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,259
Whiskey.

155
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,438
Don't want no trouble
in here, mister.

156
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,030
l didn't bring any in.

157
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,439
l'm buying you a drink.

158
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,911
All right.

159
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,458
Well, here's to you, friend.

160
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,359
Happy New Year, Jericho.

161
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,100
What does that damn fool
think he's doing?

162
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,795
Bringing that nigger in here?

163
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,040
Bartender, kick that
pile of shit outta here.

164
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,741
Take it easy,
it'll be all right.

165
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,386
Tell you what, mister,
we're not bothering you...

166
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,251
and we're not
looking for no trouble.

167
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,730
l ain't talking to you,
l'm talking to him.

168
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,737
But you're talking about me and
l don't like what you're saying.

169
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,905
-Listen...
-Take it easy, it's all right.

170
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,033
l can handle this
Just all by myself.

171
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,479
Appears you need
to be taught your place, boy.

172
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,811
Are you sure you're
the one to teach me?

173
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,989
''Who ever shall smite thee
on the right cheek...

174
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,254
turn to him the other also.''

175
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,157
Well, l'll be damned.
A Bible spouting nigger.

176
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,668
What does the good book say
you should do...

177
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,898
if l smite your other cheek?

178
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,630
lt's okay.

179
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,646
The Lord had the good sense
to leave that up to me.

180
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,327
Not you, mister.

181
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,864
You're gonna wish
you hadn't done that.

182
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:37,421
lt's my turn now, boy.
l'm gonna whoop you good.

183
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:15,122
All right, you've had your fun,
now it's my turn.

184
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,354
-Go get your gun.
-l ain't got a gun, mister.

185
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,460
Somebody give him a gun.

186
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,629
l don't fight with guns.

187
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,264
-Take the gun.
-No.

188
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:35,411
l have had enough of your mouth.
Put that gun on.

189
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,315
No.

190
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:43,413
Gonna give you a choice, mister.
Take the gun or six-foot of rope.

191
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,752
Jake?

192
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,868
lt's not you l want, mister.

193
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,352
You got a name, bluebelly?
l like to know who l'm killing.

194
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,932
Jericho.
My name is Jericho.

195
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,000
Jericho?

196
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,839
You mean ''dead man''.

197
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,309
Let's get outta here, fast.

198
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,849
How'd you come to handle
a gun like that?

199
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,186
l don't know,
Just seemed right.

200
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,630
You don't reckon
you was a gunfighter, do you?

201
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,709
We shoulda Just walked away.

202
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,843
You can't Just walk away
from a thing like that.

203
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:23,450
Mister, you can walk away
from anything, anything at all.

204
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,724
We Just better move on.

205
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,559
What's the matter?

206
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,867
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

207
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,107
Just trying
to remember something.

208
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,838
You know...

209
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,977
there's a lot
of lost souls out there.

210
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,086
Without a little help...

211
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,255
not many ever find themselves.

212
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,567
Where did you learn
how to talk like that?

213
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:17,033
Well...

214
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,404
when l was a slave
back in Georgia...

215
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,780
my master used to hire me
out to the preacher.

216
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,676
A good man,
always quoting from the bible.

217
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,684
Tried to save my soul.

218
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,887
Poor fella.

219
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,494
Well, where we going now,
preacher?

220
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,559
We?

221
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,965
l'm headed to Texas.

222
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,966
Texas?

223
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:50,265
Yep, plan to being there
for the spring roundup.

224
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,807
But we got plenty of time.

225
00:26:56,081 --> 00:27:00,017
When we're done eating breakfast,
we'll head for Jericho.

226
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:04,483
Jericho? Why Jericho?

227
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,857
That's where
that train come from.

228
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,091
And if you was a passenger on it,
they'll know you there.

229
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,098
Suppose they don't?

230
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:22,463
Then we'll talk to the Marshall.
Sure he'll know what to do.

231
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,626
Shall we gather at the river?

232
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,063
HalleluJah!

233
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,485
Well, if it isn't
the wandering minstrel.

234
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,385
Joshua,
can you give us a hand?

235
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,885
''Only ask and you
shall receive.''

236
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,981
You ladies enJoy your baptism?

237
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,560
You ain't a damn bit funny,
preacher.

238
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,857
Yeah, l am.

239
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,802
When you boys stop laughing.

240
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,999
You can climb down from those
ponies and build us girls a fire.

241
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,138
Where's your man?

242
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:09,280
Gone on head. Gotta find a place
to relocate our business.

243
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,515
We'll build you one.

244
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,060
Joshua, what'cha doing
up this way?

245
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,827
Just a little work of the Lord.

246
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,272
l'd say there's a little too much
work of Lord going on in these parts.

247
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,967
ls that why you're all on the road?

248
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,911
-Yep.
-About what l figured.

249
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,505
-Where you two headed?
-We're headed up to Jericho.

250
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,348
We wore out our welcome there.

251
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,145
What do you plan to do?

252
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,013
Find some answers.

253
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:01,230
And that was a Christmas day and
he still can't remember nothing.

254
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,295
Joshua, this is none
of my business...

255
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,529
but if he really
is a friend of yours...

256
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,874
l wouldn't go anywhere
near Jericho...

257
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,035
and l'd sure stay clear
of Paradise.

258
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,308
What you getting at?

259
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,574
There's was a holdup in Jericho
the day before Christmas.

260
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,712
The Sheriff from Paradise
got himself killed.

261
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,750
What's that got to do
with my Jericho?

262
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,987
There's a witness,
a schoolteacher.

263
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,030
Well, somehow she got a hold of
a hunk of a two by four...

264
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,861
and went after the killer. With it

265
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,695
and opened up
his head real good.

266
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,972
Three men were involved
in the holdup...

267
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,770
and somehow they got on the train
and got out of town.

268
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,903
Two of the men were gunned
down over at Rock Springs...

269
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,680
the third one wasn't with them.

270
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,875
Hasn't been seen
or heard of at since.

271
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,481
The one that got away
was the killer.

272
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,691
The one with his head
smashed in.

273
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,029
l'm not going to Texas,
that's all there is to it.

274
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:16,230
Well, go anywhere you like,
as long as it ain't New Mexico.

275
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,077
l'm going to Jericho, Paradise,
every town within a...

276
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,773
You won't have to go
past Jericho.

277
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,944
There's a schoolteacher there
knows who you are.

278
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,381
But she's more at
to tell the law than you.

279
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:31,980
What do you mean?

280
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,889
You took place in a holdup.
Killed a lawman...

281
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,326
the Sheriff from Paradise.

282
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,298
Well, how do you know?

283
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,735
The madame, she was there.

284
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:52,202
You're a wanted man
with a price on your head.

285
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,041
You've gotta get outta here.

286
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,209
l'm headed for Texas.

287
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,378
l don't think l did it.

288
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,627
Well, you can be a dead man
in Jericho...

289
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,693
or you can ride with me.

290
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:23,565
Walk through darkness,
l don't need no light

291
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,878
My faith in Jesus
gonna be my guide

292
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,843
Ain't afraid of nothing
'cause l believe

293
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:36,815
l gotta sky full of angels
watching over me

294
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,624
Watch your, Johnny-O.

295
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,455
Come on, there,
you got them rode.

296
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,357
Come on! Come on!

297
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,461
Don't let him throw you, Johnny.

298
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,991
That's it.

299
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,666
Muy bueno.

300
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,976
-Got him?
-l've got him.

301
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,382
There you go.

302
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,361
Peace to you, friend.

303
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:26,261
You must be the preacher.
Heard you might be riding in.

304
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,035
This here's Jericho.

305
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,307
l'm Johnny. Johnny-O.

306
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,684
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

307
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,360
-Where can l find Pap Dooling?
-Pap Dooling?

308
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,794
Chuck wagon.

309
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,232
Come and get it, boys!

310
00:33:58,836 --> 00:33:59,894
Just right up there.

311
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,150
Hi.

312
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,324
-Howdy, Pap.
-Where you been, preacher?

313
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,027
Just chasing the wind.
Doing a little of the Lords work.

314
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,862
-Well, how you been?
-Good.

315
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:26,557
l was wondering when
you were gonna get here.

316
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:27,822
Yes, sir.

317
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,460
-Chasing the wind?
-Just chasing the wind.

318
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,968
That be why you're traveling
with a fast iron?

319
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,234
Jericho?
He ain't no gunfighter.

320
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,003
He's Just an old cowboy
looking for a little work.

321
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,682
Just a cowboy... ls that why
he's packing that iron?

322
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,184
Don't look like
no cowboy to me.

323
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:49,051
Pap, you know l don't run
with no gunfighter.

324
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:53,154
Besides, he don't hire on,
l don't hire on.

325
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,024
l didn't say l wasn't hiring.

326
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,498
Jericho, you and Josh
can go slop some grub.

327
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,701
Appreciate you throwing in with us,
we need all the help we can get.

328
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,865
Appreciate it, pal.

329
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,901
-Thank you.
-Obliged, partner.

330
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,800
Johnny-O...

331
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,070
these boys finish eating...

332
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,949
snake them on down
to the remuda.

333
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,849
Have Carlos pick them up
a string.

334
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:22,583
Cowboys...

335
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,716
Yes, yes.

336
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,724
Jericho, you any good
with that gun?

337
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,493
He ain't no gunfighter.

338
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,131
Sure, preacher.

339
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,234
-Grubs getting cold.
-We'll be there.

340
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,437
Keep an eye out
for bunch quitters.

341
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,684
lf you mean cattle,
l haven't seen any around.

342
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:31,553
Yeah. How long a time
you spent in the calvary?

343
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,948
-What makes you say that?
-The way you sit a horse.

344
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,386
Just feels natural.

345
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:44,696
Yeah. What part of the country
you hail from, son?

346
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,738
Here and there.

347
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,644
-Yankee?
-Yeah, l suppose l am.

348
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,239
You running
from something, son?

349
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,675
Everybody here's running
from something.

350
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,648
l Just came here to work, Pap.

351
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,657
That's all that counts.

352
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,926
Don't matter where you're from
or what you've done.

353
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:17,029
l guess l'll go find
some of those brunch...

354
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,269
-Bunch quitters.
-Bunch quitters.

355
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,836
Stray cattle.

356
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,406
Get over.

357
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,590
That calf don't know
where he's headed.

358
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,517
Probably doesn't know
where he's from either.

359
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,418
Maybe l'll take this one.

360
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,659
Yeah.

361
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,037
Good morning, vaqueros.

362
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,538
Good morning.

363
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,810
A few cattle won't be missed.

364
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,655
l can't let you take them,
they ain't mine to give.

365
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,129
You not wear pistol,
how you stop us?

366
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,730
Leave the cattle and move on.

367
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,662
ls he so fast
he can kill us all?

368
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,043
There's no need for gunplay.

369
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,085
The good Lord giveth
and the good Lord taketh away.

370
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,952
This ain't our battle,
this battle's the Lords.

371
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,818
Hey, pistolero!

372
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,927
Drop your gun belt or we'll send
the preacher to his Lord.

373
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,498
Easy.

374
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,092
Just do as he says.

375
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,713
What's going on, boys?

376
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,519
Not much, Pap. Just having
a friendly little discussion.

377
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,423
Friendly?

378
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,455
You're plopping me
a mule turd, Josh.

379
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,837
Good afternoon, friends.

380
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,743
These old boys are
about as friendly...

381
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,543
as a grizzly bear with an
apache arrow stuck up its ass.

382
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,407
What do you think, Johnny-O?

383
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,917
l think we got
a maJor problem here, Pap.

384
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,909
What with Jericho's gun
on the ground and all.

385
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,257
Pap, keep your hand off
that pistol...

386
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,092
unless you want
to get us both killed.

387
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,862
What the hell's the difference?
They gonna kill us, ain't they?

388
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,796
We might as well take
a couple of them with us.

389
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,196
Well, l was figuring on sending
them on without us...

390
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,861
-if it's all the same to you.
-That's what l'm talking about.

391
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,670
-Pap?
-Not now, preacher.

392
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,048
What is it you think, gringo?

393
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,807
l'll tell you what l think.

394
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,555
l think you have to squat
when you piss.

395
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,438
That was slicker than a snake
sucking eggs, Johnny-O.

396
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,344
Thank you, Pap.

397
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,084
You and these cowboys
bring the herd back on in.

398
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,787
-Pap, what about them?
-What about them?

399
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,516
You ain't gonna leave them here
for the buzzards.

400
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,485
You're a better man than that.

401
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,921
l'll send Mud and Peewee
back to bury them.

402
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,061
You'll get over it, preacher.
They only had two choices.

403
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,561
The other one was hanging.

404
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,966
A rustler's a rustler.

405
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,771
God bless you.

406
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,339
Pick up their horses, preacher.

407
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,017
You owe me one.

408
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,551
Yeah, l reckon l do.

409
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,532
40 dollars, AleJandro.

410
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,106
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

411
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,733
Joshua, 40 dollars.

412
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,674
Jericho, 40 dollars.

413
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,081
Joaquin, 40 dollars.

414
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,607
Johnny-O...

415
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,830
So, how much we gonna have
by the end of this drive?

416
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,053
l figured...

417
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,664
about 300 dollars.

418
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,273
-That's a pretty fair stake.
-Yeah, it is.

419
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,763
What are you gonna do
with yours?

420
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,976
Been giving a little thought
to homesteading a piece of land.

421
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,045
California?

422
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,841
No, North Texas.

423
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:35,149
Why there?

424
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,256
'Cause California don't border
on the indian territory...

425
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,125
and if a man's gonna
settle down...

426
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,423
there might oughta be
a woman in his plans.

427
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,587
So, anyone special
in your plans?

428
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,789
lndian girls are all special.

429
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,396
Her name's Calypso.

430
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,230
Yeah, l'm looking forward
to settling down again myself.

431
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,608
Again?

432
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,142
You boys going to town?
lt's your last chance.

433
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,610
Heading outta here
day after tomorrow.

434
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,488
No, Pap, l believe
l'm gonna save my money.

435
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,149
Sure you won't change
your mind?

436
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,293
l'm sure there's at least one
little Juanita...

437
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,124
Just waiting for you in town.

438
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,456
He takes all that money
to town with him.

439
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,358
Your pockets will be emptier than
a whore's hope chest come morning.

440
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:31,670
You maybe right,
but it'll be money well spent.

441
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:35,102
Now, if you do decide
to come to town...

442
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,839
l'll be at the saloon.

443
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,987
-Joshua?
-Yes, sir.

444
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,396
l don't know if Jericho's
a gunfighter or not...

445
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,365
but l know Johnny-O
is itching to find out.

446
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,698
So, if you go to town,
keep them separeted.

447
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,862
Well, l reckon
l better go to town.

448
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,565
-Thank you, Pap.
-Thank you.

449
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,609
-God bless you.
-Same to you.

450
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,668
l'm gonna go whiskey
pickle my bladder.

451
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,554
What's the matter?

452
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,655
l don't think l did it.

453
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,131
Did what?

454
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,196
Killed that Sheriff.

455
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:41,467
-Do you remember something?
-No, Just a feeling.

456
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,046
l want to go back.

457
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:52,680
Well...

458
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,092
after the drive,
we'll go back.

459
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,297
Let's go to town.

460
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,368
Pretty good when a preacher
says that to you.

461
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,646
l think mister Sam's
about to throw a shoe.

462
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,187
l'm gonna go on down
to the blacksmith.

463
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,026
l'll meet you here at the store.

464
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,655
All right.

465
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,952
Almost didn't recognize you
without your shadow.

466
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:08,789
Come on.

467
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,688
Bartender,
whiskey for my friend.

468
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,599
Johnny-O, l need to see
some more money from you.

469
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,672
You all right?
You're Jumpy, l scared you.

470
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,142
No.

471
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,352
Well...

472
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,517
if it ain't the boys
from Brown County.

473
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,291
Don't turn around.

474
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,460
They're over by the door,
there's two of them.

475
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,499
Gunfighters.

476
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,070
Who are they looking for?

477
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,466
Me.

478
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,643
l want no part of this.

479
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,979
You owe me.

480
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,520
Look at them,
lined up like ducks on a pond.

481
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,489
l have to say
that's real considerate.

482
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,753
Hey, you there...

483
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,787
move away from that bar.

484
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,395
l believe he's talking to you.

485
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,831
Unless you've changed your mind,
l'd say now is time to go.

486
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,276
All right.

487
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:43,718
You finish that drink,
go ahead and make your move.

488
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:50,292
Well, have it your way, stranger,
makes no never mind to me.

489
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,052
Johnny-O, you get your hands up
and turn around.

490
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,663
You lrish piece of shit.

491
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,600
You take loud mouth
and l'll get the other one.

492
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:24,516
Johnny-O, burn in hell,
you son of a bitch.

493
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,695
l'll see you there, old man.

494
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:57,187
You riding with me?

495
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,460
No.

496
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,799
Suit yourself. l'd be
getting out of Texas though.

497
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,790
We Just killed the Sheriff
from Brown County.

498
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,318
Come on.
Come on, we gotta get.

499
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,515
Come on.

500
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,503
You may have killed that lawman
in Jericho and you may not..

501
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,405
but that don't matter now.

502
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,314
l told you l didn't know
he was a Sheriff.

503
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,050
What difference does that make?

504
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,484
There ain't a Jury on Earth
that's gonna believe you.

505
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,989
You a ripe candidate
for a hangman's noose...

506
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:02,220
-and we know that for certain now.
-Yes, we do.

507
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,186
So where do we go?

508
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,466
Jericho, if you're gonna
ride with me...

509
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,027
you take that gun off
and you keep it off.

510
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,399
l mean it.

511
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:44,333
You put that gun on again
and it'll be over my dead body.

512
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:48,235
-l Just wanna do right.
-And you think killing is right?

513
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,376
Righteousness is sewn in peace
by those who make peace..

514
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,479
and we won't find it
in Texas now.

515
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:46,054
Preacher man talking
about the end of time

516
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,926
Lord knows l'm ready

517
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,190
Don't worry in my mind

518
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,630
How come you're so happy?

519
00:52:55,071 --> 00:53:00,031
'Cause there's a sky full
of angels watching over me

520
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,579
When are you gonna learn
how to sing?

521
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,446
Mister Sam
kinda likes my singing.

522
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:11,046
-He told you that, did he?
-Yeah.

523
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,220
When are you gonna learn
how to find gold?

524
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:19,795
-l know how to pan for gold.
-Yeah. Fools gold.

525
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:21,996
You're boots aren't wet.

526
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,964
Why don't you start singing
that darn song again?

527
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,205
You can take
all my possessions

528
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,607
You can take all my gold

529
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:34,373
But nobody but Jesus
gonna take my soul

530
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:58,531
No, no ''shissing''.
No ''shissing''.

531
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,334
You're too young for that.
Now, Just give me the gun.

532
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,073
That's it, Just give me the gun.
You're gonna be okay.

533
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,104
Okay, come on, come on.
You're gonna be okay.

534
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,551
May God have mercy.

535
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,013
May God have mercy.

536
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,556
Are you sure
there's a God out there?

537
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,807
You be careful now, son, okay?
You be careful.

538
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,551
-Good bye, ma'am
-Thank you.

00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,590
-You take care of your ma, son.
-l will, mister.

542
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:16,345
You all right?

543
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,915
Yeah, yeah, fine.

544
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,643
You, madame...

545
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:49,779

marvelous traveling partner.

546
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:50,939
Thank you.

547
00:55:58,722 --> 00:55:59,450
Thanks.

548
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,453
Pardon me, gentlemen.

549
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:25,547
-What's the matter?
-l think he recognized me.

550
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:30,445
-You're Just Jumpy.
-l'm gonna go find out.

551
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,554
That's a US Marshall and you
ain't had much luck with them.

552
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,253
Well, l haven't had
much luck with you either.

553
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:47,526
Let me see your fist.

554
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,902
You didn't hit me with that...
You hit me with a rock.

555
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,346
You know the good Lord
didn't deliver you to me...

556
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,870
to see you get hung.

557
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,417
Yeah, He didn't deliver you...

558
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,612
to hit me in the head
with a rock either l don't think.

559
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:06,983
-lt wasn't a rock.
-lt felt like one.

560
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,588
Where'd you say
we where headed, anyway?

561
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,421
lndian territory.

562
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:17,063
You know, my Calypso,
she ain't gonna wait forever.

563
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:21,430
Besides, l got
enough gold right here...

564
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:24,473
l can buy her
from the chief now.

565
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,539
And that's where we're headed.

566
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:30,346
-lndian territory?
-Yeah, come on.

567
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:38,919
That's a good looking sign.

568
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,926
Joshua...

569
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,386

570
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,390
Joshua and Jericho.

571
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,492
Nope, it's Jericho and Joshua.

572
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:57,807
Well, don't Joshua come first?

573
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,275
Listen, you made me
the ranch foreman...

574
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,436
l'm supposed to make
these important decisions.

575
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,347
Don't l own this place?

576
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,212
That's why you made me
ranch foreman.

577
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:09,244
Well, Joshua comes
before Jericho.

578
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,852
Not in the alphabet
l'm used to using.

579
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:13,416
You what?

580
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,255
Joshua?

581
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,353
Come here.

582
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:24,167
Well, we can
finish that tomorrow.

583
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,537
Nope, l gonna finish this Job
then l'm headed into town.

584
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,438
Sorry, Calypso, but l'm gonna have
to miss your good cooking tonight.

585
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,232
-Heading in to town?
-Yep, got things to do.

586
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,146
When you gonna get yourself
a real woman?

587
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,773
The marrying kind?

588
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:44,748
Don't know.

589
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,923
Well, why don't you Just
come on down to eat a bite...

590
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:51,261
before you go on in to town?

591
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,092
No, l'll see you later.
l'll be back tomorrow.

592
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,065
All right.
Good night.

00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,498
Come on eat a bite with us.

594
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:58,758
How about it?

595
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,435
Save some leftovers.

596
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:02,901
Might be some.

597
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,176
Mary?

598
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:56,719
Mary?

599
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:02,989

600
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:50,398

601
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:08,976
Let's go.

602
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,908
Joshua? Joshua?

603
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:49,983
Joshua?

604
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:02,996
Why?

605
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,906
Why?

606
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,043
'Cause he killed
a white man, that's why.

607
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:49,648
Mister, there's three of us.

608
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,113
Just who the hell
you think you are?

609
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,526
l don't know.

610
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,289
''l will fear no evil...

611
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:06,657
Thou art with me...

612
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:13,829
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.''

613
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,004
Peace, friend.

614
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,796
-Jericho?
-Yeah?

615
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,499
Where will you go?

616
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,035
New Mexico.

617
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,232
They'll hang you there.

618
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,877
At least l'll know
who they're hanging.

619
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,713
You gonna stay?

620
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,476
l'm gonna go back
to my people.

621
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,048
l want you to take the mustang.

622
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,793
Mister Sam's days
are numbered.

623
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,068
Want a whiskey?

624
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:21,151
You got a place
where l can keep my horse?

625
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,255
Livery stable.
Cost you two dollars.

626
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:33,965
You rub him down with a gunnysack
and give him some oats.

627
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,303
Horse out front?

628
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,041
You gonna want a bed?

629
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,578
-Yeah.
-Top of the stairs, room 2.

630
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:50,216
You won't need a key,
locks don't work.

631
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,202
You're too late, mister.

632
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,614
Too late for what?

633
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,276
There won't be another train
until the end of the week.

634
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:36,213
How do l get to Paradise?

635
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:42,663
Take the west road out of town.
But it's a good days ride.

636
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:18,200
They're Just a bunch
of drunk men.

637
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,896
No way. Shoot!

638
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:40,454
Well, whatta we got here?
Ya'll suppose it's Santa Claus?

639
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:47,054
Santa? How about you haul your
rosy ass cheek on outta my way...

640
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,425
before l put a bullet
through you.

641
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,903
Well, how about it,
Santa Claus?

642
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:02,978
Son, you've got a big mouth
and it shall be your undoing.

643
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,138
Merry Christmas.

644
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:17,557
Hold it right there, mister.

645
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:23,788
All right, folks, on your way.
You've all got better things to do.

646
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,698
l'd say you were
pretty lucky, Luke.

647
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:33,074
You better go over to the Docs
office and have that hand seen to.

648
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,308
This ought to cover it.

649
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,445
Do l know you?

650
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:50,819
You all right?

651
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,863
Look, it's Christmas eve,
so l'm not going to hold you...

652
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,157
if l can have your word
you'll leave the town.

653
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,160
l'll show you to your horse.

654
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:09,341
You look awfully young
to be a Sheriff.

655
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:13,715
Just a deputy. My father
used to be Sheriff here though.

656
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,774
Maybe you heard of him,
Will McCullough.

657
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,789
So, what's your father
doing now?

658
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,123
He was killed
in a holdup over in Jericho.

659
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,937
Did they catch his killer?

660
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:44,746
No.

661
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:47,979
Any witnesses?

662
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:50,678
Yeah, a woman.

663
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:52,409
She's our school teacher now.

664
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:55,623
Folks hired her in a way of saying
thanks for what she did.

665
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:02,428
You gonna be all right?

666
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,967
l'll be fine, son.

667
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,628
Came as quick as l could, Will.
That him?

668
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,597
Yeah, strange man.

669
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,660
l swear l've met him before.

670
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:41,068
-Where's he heading?
-He didn't say.

671
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,868
Well, don't matter.
As long as he's gone.

672
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:50,602
Ma says l was supposed to make
sure you'd be on time for super.

673
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:53,982
l hadn't missed one of your ma's
Christmas dinner in yers.

674
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,711
She knows that, now get.

675
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,967
-Who is it?
-Open the door.

676
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,907
What do you want?

677
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,641
Who are you?
What do you want?

678
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:27,675
My God.

679
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,218
You know me.

680
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,981
l've never seen you before
in my life.

681
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,156
No, no.

682
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:38,388
Why don't you take another look?
Take a good long look.

683
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,763
Seven years ago today.

684
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,097
You remember?
Remember?

685
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:55,202
Who am l?
Tell me who l am.

686
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,140
You're Sheriff McCullough.

687
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:11,017
-So, when are you coming back, pa?
-Day after tomorrow.

688
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,655
l should be arriving about
the same time as Saint Nichols.

689
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,865
Well, suppose the baby
comes by then.

690
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,470
Don't worry, the Doc says
you're not due for another week.

691
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,234
Besides, Tom will be here
to look after you until l get back.

692
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:27,207
Baby, what does Tom know
about delivering a baby?

693
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,070
Probably more than l do.

694
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,116
Sure wish l cold ride
with you tomorrow, pa.

695
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,811
Well, not this time, son.

696
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,287
We're gonna need a man
around the house...

697
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,346
to look after your mother
until l get back.

698
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:46,228
lt's a big Job, you probably need
a lot of sleep for it too.

699
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,752
-Good night, pa.
-Good night.

700
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,090
-Good night, ma.
-Sleep tight.

701
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,668
She sure can kick.

702
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,975
So, what makes you so sure
that it's a girl?

703
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:01,465
Well, l Just know.

704
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:08,014
Well, in that case, l better shop
for a doll before l start home.

705
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,119
Why don't you get Tom to take
that prisoner into Jericho?

706
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,247
No, the bank wants me to pick up
the payroll for the mines...

707
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,725
and l want to pick up
that reward money...

708
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:19,795
so this year you and Will...

709
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,320
and whoever this is
can have a real Christmas.

710
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,227
You Just keep that candle burning
until l get back.

711
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,716
Here's that letter
so you can pick up the payroll.

712
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,377
Thanks, Tom.
l suppose l'll need that.

713
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,016
-Good think.
-Yes, sir.

714
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,049
-Keep will out of trouble.
-He'll be fine.

715
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,193
-You ain't gonna get me there.
-Shut up, Dorland.

716
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:04,973
Tom, look after Mary
until l get back.

717
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:06,031
You know l will.

718
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,084
You ain't gonna keep me
in here.

719
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,656
Now, whatta you think
you're gonna do, Dorland?

720
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,825
Your gonna gnaw
your way out of here...

721
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,884
like the little rat that you are?

722
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:44,873
Sit down.

723
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:53,520
Will, there's your
reward money.

724
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,582
Thank you, Marshall.

725
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:00,428
Now, Will, l wouldn't be
flashing it around so much.

726
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,497
This town's still pretty
wide open.

727
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:05,133
l know, Jericho's
got a reputation.

728
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:09,001
No, not for long. City council
passed some new laws.

729
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:12,541
January we're gonna have
to run out the gamblers...

730
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,609
then we're gonna have
to run out the hookers.

731
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,406
Then, they're gonna have
to run you out.

732
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:17,873
Yeah.

733
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:21,441
You know, folks in Paradise
don't seem to mind that too much.

734
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,819
Well, you built
a real nice town...

735
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,946
for the good folks
over there, Will.

736
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:29,486
Built a good reputation
for yourself in the doing.

737
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:32,093
l Just for the life of me
can't understand...

738
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:35,756
how you can enJoy being
the Sheriff in such a quiet town.

739
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:40,998
You take care
of yourself, Marshall.

740
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:44,237
l always take care
of myself, Will.

741
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,632
Merry Christmas.

742
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:49,402
Happy New Year.
You be careful.

743
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,630
How are you doing tonight?

744
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,129
What'll it be?

745
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,437
l'll take a room for the night,
bedding for a couple of hoses.

746
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:24,772
Number two, top of the stairs.
You won't need a key and all told.

747
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,242
Four dollars.

748
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:28,376
This should cover it.

749
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:32,153
-A hundred? Smallest you got?
-Yeah.

750
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:35,724
Tell you what, cook me up one
of those nice Juicy steaks.

751
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,284
Run it by the fire on the way
to my table, okay?

752
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,224
What about the change?

753
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,826
You can bring that
to the table, too.

754
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:05,653
Jack, some yokel Just paid for his
room with a hundred-dollar bill.

755
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:07,754
A hundred-dollar bi...

756
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,960
lt was the smallest
bill he had.

757
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,058
He'll be down
in a few minutes for dinner.

758
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,265
You ready to go to work,
Millie?

759
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,870
-What do you want me to do?
-Whatever it takes.

760
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,041
lf he likes to gamble,
you bring him to me.

761
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:37,110
lf he likes to drink,
get him drunk.

762
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:38,952
lf he's a lover...

763
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,127
Jack, you don't really
want me to...

764
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:50,962
Millie, Just this once, baby.

765
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:53,968
For us.

766
01:22:57,172 --> 01:23:00,664
Whatever it takes, do it.

767
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:26,590
May l sit down?

768
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:30,065
You look like the only
gentleman in the room.

769
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,930
My name is Mildred Flynn.

770
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:33,525
Check his room.

771
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,862
Shilogh, keep me company.

772
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,140
l'm pleased to meet you.
My name's Will McCullough.

773
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:45,680
-You from around here, Will?
-No ma'am, from Paradise.

774
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,913
Paradise? Now, that's a nice name.
Sounds rather heavenly.

775
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:53,578
lt is.

776
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,620
Well, sort of.

777
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:58,816
May l buy you a drink?

778
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:01,930
lt's almost Christmas and l
would love to toast the season..

779
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,795
with a nice gentleman like you.

780
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,590
Champagne, please.

781
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:13,775
Look, l have to say...

782
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:19,080
that l really appreciate your
hospitality, miss Flynn, but..

783
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,742
Thank you.
Call me Millie.

784
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:24,879
Millie.

785
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:33,016
So, where you from, Millie?

786
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,455
l'm from Texas.

787
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:39,396
But l'm going to San Francisco.
l'm a school teacher.

788
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,104
You know you should really stop
by Paradise on your way.

789
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,401
And why's that?

790
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,342
Well, we Just built
a new schoolhouse.

791
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,673
They're gonna be looking
for a teacher.

792
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:55,744
That's mighty nice of you to offer.
l might have to takeup on that.

793
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:05,018
We hit the Jackpot.

794
01:26:05,593 --> 01:26:07,462
That yokel's the Sheriff
from Paradise...

795
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:09,521
and he's here
to pick up a payroll.

796
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:24,005
Well, it's been
a pleasure, Millie.

797
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,014
Do you really have to go?

798
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,005
We were Just getting
to know each other.

799
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:31,514
Well, l have to meet a train
tomorrow at 5 AM...

800
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:35,587
and it's a day Journey back
to Paradise. So, good night.

801
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,753
-Good night.
-Thank you.

802
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,826
My pleasure.

803
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:00,707
What happened?

804
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,141
Nothing.

805
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:06,187
Did he tell you anything?

806
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:11,259
Not really. Only that he's from
a small town called Paradise...

807
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,160
and he's meeting the train
at 5 AM in the morning.

808
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,289
No...

809
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,496
he isn't.

810
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:22,132
l am.

811
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,905
Give him a couple of hours.

812
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:34,182
And then l want you to go up
to his room, get his clothes..

813
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:38,953
his badge and his gun,
set outside in the hallway.

814
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:43,287
Then l want you
to keep him busy while l...

815
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:47,929
or rather, while the Sheriff
meets the train.

816
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,056
Jack, if you really
loved me you wouldn't...

817
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,803
lt's because l love you, baby.

818
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:08,738
With this money l could give you
everything you ever dreamed of.

819
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,448
This our big chance,
yours and mine.

820
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:20,086
Please, do it for us.

821
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:38,970
Go on, now.

822
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:04,505
Now, l'm gonna fix
a bottle of champagne...

823
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,234
that'll put him
to sleep forever.

824
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:09,868
What about Millie?
She might drink some of it.

825
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:14,004
Now, wouldn't that be
Just too bad.

826
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:10,281
Will, l brought champagne.

827
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,156
Who are you?

828
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:24,497
Why did you wait until now
to come after me?

829
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,448
That's a long story.

830
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:43,149
Your son's
the Deputy Sheriff now.

831
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:49,987
They say he's Just like
you used to be.

832
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,801
Have you seen your wife?

833
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:12,779
You have a daughter,
did you know?

834
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:18,858
She turns seven tomorrow.

835
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:25,159
She's born in Christmas day.

836
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,394
The day after you were killed.

837
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:46,480
Sheriff?

838
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,059
What about me?

839
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,865
Merry Christmas.

840
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:02,920
Tom, lets sing Silent Night.

841
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:15,465
Silent night, holy night!

842
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:23,269
All is calm, all is bright

843
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:31,111
Round yon virgin mother
and child

844
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:38,952
Holy infant so tender and mild

845
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:47,067
Sleep in heavenly peace!

846
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:54,139
Sleep in heavenly peace!
