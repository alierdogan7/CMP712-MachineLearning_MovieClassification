Marshal Earp, give me a gun !

1661
03:02:28,103 --> 03:02:31,356
For God's sake, let me protect myself!

1662
03:02:33,150 --> 03:02:37,195
Tommy, if I hear one more sound
out of you, I'm gonna help them do it.

1663
03:02:37,613 --> 03:02:41,866
FRANCIS: It seems your brothers were off
coIIecting renegade Indians in another town.

1664
03:02:42,034 --> 03:02:43,618
You were all alone.

1665
03:02:43,786 --> 03:02:47,872
They were shouting that they ought to
just shoot you, take Tommy with them.

1666
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:50,959
FinaIIy, when they quieted down,
you said:

1667
03:02:51,126 --> 03:02:52,877
Nice mob you got here.

1668
03:02:53,045 --> 03:02:56,714
-I said, we want Tommy O'Rourke!
MEN: Yeah !

1669
03:02:57,424 --> 03:03:00,760
Get set for disappointment,
because you're not gonna get him.

1670
03:03:00,928 --> 03:03:03,513
MAN 1 : He killed one of my men.
MAN 2: He killed a man !

1671
03:03:03,681 --> 03:03:05,723
He'll stand trial for that.

1672
03:03:05,891 --> 03:03:09,727
You arrogant son of a bitch.
You think you can stop all of us?

1673
03:03:17,236 --> 03:03:19,570
You boys can get me.

1674
03:03:20,114 --> 03:03:23,741
That won't be any problem
with all the guns you got here.

1675
03:03:24,743 --> 03:03:27,578
But I'm taking 1 0 or 1 2 of you with me.

1676
03:03:27,746 --> 03:03:29,372
Starting with you, Dick Gird.

1677
03:03:29,915 --> 03:03:32,083
And you, McGee.

1678
03:03:32,876 --> 03:03:35,420
Maybe you too, Harvey.

1679
03:03:37,881 --> 03:03:40,883
So if any of you want Tommy. . .

1680
03:03:41,051 --> 03:03:43,052
. . .and you want me. . .

1681
03:03:44,263 --> 03:03:47,098
. . .come up front with these brave men.

1682
03:03:47,266 --> 03:03:49,600
We'll all go together.

1683
03:04:24,970 --> 03:04:27,180
Anyway, that's what my father told us.

1684
03:04:29,391 --> 03:04:31,434
What happened to your Uncle Tommy?

1685
03:04:32,728 --> 03:04:35,313
He was shot dead up at Omaha in '87.

1686
03:04:37,775 --> 03:04:40,234
Guess he wasn't worth saving.

1687
03:04:41,904 --> 03:04:44,447
Anyway, it's an honor. . .

1688
03:04:44,615 --> 03:04:46,908
. . . Mr. Earp, sir.

1689
03:04:47,326 --> 03:04:48,993
Ma'am.

1690
03:05:02,174 --> 03:05:05,176
Some people say
it didn't happen that way.

1691
03:05:06,595 --> 03:05:08,846
JOSIE:
Never mind them, Wyatt.

1692
03:05:09,014 --> 03:05:11,516
It happened that way.
