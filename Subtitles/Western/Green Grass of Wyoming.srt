18
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,576

00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,829

22
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,479
Grandpa!

23
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,536
Grandpa, get up. Get up, Grandpa.

24
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,698
- Another mare's gone.
- Huh?

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,373
- Another mare's gone. It's Lady Hanover.
- Lady Hanover?

26
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,126
She was run off by some stallion.
His hoofprints are all over the place.

27
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,753
By ginger, it's that Thunderhead.

28
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:19,845
- Well, don't stand there. Let's go after her.
- It's too late. She's dead.

29
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:20,963
Dead?

30
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:26,218
She tried to jump that gulch in the upper
pasture. I found her lying down at the bottom.

31
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,353
Lady Hanover.

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,275
The finest trotting mare a man ever had.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,396
Why, it was only last spring
we bred her to Willie D.

34
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,564
I was counting on her colt.

35
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,191
- I'm sorry, Grandpa.
- Don't you feel sorry for me!

36
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:46,537
By ginger, I'm going to tell those
McLaughlins a thing or two. You just wait.

37
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,502
Ohh...

38
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,716
Tell me, was I very...?

39
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,050
Yes.

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,847
- What day is it?
- Tuesday.

41
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,477
Tuesday.

42
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,765
You've been that way since Sunday.

43
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,696
I'll put the coffee on.

44
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,712
Oh! Carey...

45
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,468
Pump for me, will you?

46
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,045
Honest, ducky, this is the last time.

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,840
- Yes, I know. Put your head down.
- Ohh!

48
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,520
Hey, what are you trying to do? Drown me?

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,357
Ouch! Ouch, you're scalping me!

50
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,444
I came here to look after you,
and I'm going to, even if it hurts.

51
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,814
There.

52
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,365
Thanks for leaving my head on my shoulders.

53
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,324
Wash your hands.
I'll have breakfast ready in a minute.

54
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,906
All right.

55
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,919
Never mind breakfast.
I just remembered I'm mad.

56
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,373
- You're not going to start a fuss.
- I'm not, eh?

57
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:22,887
Thunderhead has stolen two of my mares and
if Rob McLaughlin won't do something, I will.

58
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,221
I'll not have you fight with Mr McLaughlin.
It's not neighbourly.

59
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,392
Grandpa, please wait till you feel better.

60
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:34,638
If I didn't feel as well as I do, I wouldn't
stand here arguing with you. Now scat.

61
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:52,703
I hope Ken doesn't forget those skillets. This
one's impossible. Just look at these eggs.

62
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,248
That kid should've been back last night.

63
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,753
It's a long pull from Los Angeles,
especially dragging a trailer.

64
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,506
I know, but that boy's got a genius
for getting into trouble.

65
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,219
<i>(knock at door)</i>

66
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:09,089
If you fight with the McLaughlins,
no one in 20 miles will talk to you.

67
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:13,312
No man's stallion's gonna
steal my mares and get away with it.

68
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:18,106
- Well, Carey, Beaver, come on in.
- McLaughlin, I've lost another mare.

69
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,111
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- He's sorry, he says.

70
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,485
It's the second mare Thunderhead has stolen.

71
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,243
Wait a minute.
How do you know it's Thunderhead?

72
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,075
Nobody's even seen him since
we turned him loose a couple of years ago.

73
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:35,039
It's Thunderhead. You know what I'm gonna
do? I'm gonna hunt him down and shoot him.

74
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:40,287
You got a perfect right to shoot him - if you
catch him at it. You haven't even seen him.

75
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,798
- Are you calling me a liar?
- Please excuse him, Mr McLaughlin.

76
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,301
- No man calls me a liar and gets away with it.
- Will you be reasonable?

77
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,141
I'll get word around
to watch out for a mare-stealer...

78
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,686
That's all I want to know. I come here
for a little action and all I get is a lot of talk.

79
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,057
I'll handle this thing my own way.

80
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,646
- I'm sorry. He doesn't really mean it.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

81
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,315
- Carey!
- Coming, Grandpa.

82
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,901
Goodbye, Mr McLaughlin.

83
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,212
Come on, Sundown, let's get outta here.

84
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,170
Hyah!

85
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,257
Huh! Calling me a liar
and sticking up for Thunderhead.

86
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,668
- Why do you have to fight with everybody?
- Me?

87
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,300
- If only you'd stop drinking.
- Stop drinking?

88
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,225
I only take a thimbleful
just to settle my nerves.

89
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:37,648
If only you would, and start training Sundown
again, then everything would be different.

90
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,020
You took the words right out of my mouth.

91
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,272
That's exactly what I'm gonna
start doing tomorrow - you watch me.

92
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,658
Hello! Pull up a minute.
I got a surprise for you.

93
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,788
- You're the one who's got a surprise coming.
- Hey! Wait a minute!

94
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:59,163
- I'll see you later, Ken.
- You keep away from those McLaughlins.

95
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,386
Do you think Thunderhead stole the mares?

96
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:15,850
If he's alive, I'm afraid so. A lot of mares
have been stolen lately besides Beaver's.

97
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,015
What are you gonna do?

98
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:21,932
If we pick up his trail soon after a mare's been
stolen, we've a good chance of catching him.

99
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,563
Then you'll have to shoot him?

100
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,229
- Yeah.
- I'm afraid that'll break Ken's heart.

101
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,576
- Kenny!
- Hi, Gus!

102
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,029
- How are things in the city?
- Great. I got a surprise in the trailer.

103
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,039
Surprises I like don't come in trailers!

104
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,784
- Ken!
- Hello, Mom. Your skillets.

105
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,119
- Thank you, son.
- Hiya, Dad.

106
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,000
The horses come through in good shape?
Mr McNulty pay you?

107
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,709
- Yes, sir. And have I got a surprise for you.
- What is it this time?

108
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,175
The most wonderful thing happened.

109
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,384
- I met a friend of yours, Whitey Eaton...
- A friend of mine?

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,263
- He let me in on a terrific deal.
- Whitey Eaton did?

111
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:03,015
- He's the crookedest horse-dealer this side...
- You've mixed him up with someone else.

112
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,686
<i>(banging)</i>

113
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,398
- Take it easy, baby.
- She looks fine, Kenny.

114
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,437
What have you got in that trailer?
Did you let Whitey Eaton sell you a horse?

115
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,483
Sure. And is she a beauty.
Hey, let's get her out, Gus.

116
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,951
Just a minute, young man.

117
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,491
Did you take the 2200 McNulty paid you
for the polo ponies

118
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:25,583
and give it to Whitey Eaton
for some broken-down piece of crowbait?

119
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:30,050
- Why, Mr Eaton says she's a sure winner.
- I told you, Whitey Eaton is a crook!

120
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:35,260
I can't agree with you, Dad. I think this mare
is a very sound business investment.

121
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,009
- Come on, take a look.
- What...

122
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:43,642
- What is she, Kenny?
- A trotter. Let me get this blanket off.

123
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,320
- There you are.
- Rob, she's beautiful.

124
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,071
Yeah, I've seen Whitey's
beautiful horses before. Come here, son.

125
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,781
Telephone him and tell him
I don't want this mare,

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,702
and after breakfast tomorrow,
you're going back to Los Angeles with it.

127
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,290
- I don't think so, Dad.
- You... you what?

128
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,047
You said that on my next birthday
I'll be a partner.

129
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,586
If so, I'm gonna have something to say.

130
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,426
You'll never be a partner
pulling stunts like this.

131
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,805
At least you can let him show her. All Ken
knows about horses is what you taught him.

132
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,891
She's by Bolomite out of
Margaret Castledon - both champions.

133
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,969
You can't beat that breeding.

134
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,683
Well, all right.
Trot her out. Let's see her.

135
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,399
Come on, baby.

136
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,058
Come on, baby, trot. Come on.

137
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,899
- Buying a horse without consulting me.
- I'm sure she'll be all right.

138
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,243
Here. Here, stop that. Down, girl!

139
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,076
- Uh-oh.
- Ken, be careful.

140
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,003
Whoa! Hey, what's the matter with you?
Down, girl!

141
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,581
I told you about Whitey.

142
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,245
What's the matter?
Something's bothering her.

143
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,924
Listen to her. She's wind-broken,
that's what's the matter with her.

144
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,467
2200 bucks right up the flue.

145
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:01,256
Boss, it might be the altitude.
It's 8200ft up here.

146
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,427
Yeah, that's it. It's the altitude.

147
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,185
Let her take it easy for a while
till her lungs fill out. Then she'll be fine.

148
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,109
Yeah, maybe.
Meanwhile, you'd better put her up, Gus.

149
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:14,108
- I'll take her, Gus.
- No, you stay here. I want a talk with you.

150
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:18,361
I'm sorry I bought her like I did, Dad.
I should have spoken to you first, but...

151
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,615
If you're going to be a partner, you can't
just use snap judgment about things.

152
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,157
Before I do anything,
I always talk it over with your mother.

153
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,623
- Well, I do.
- Of course, darling.

154
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,285
Why don't you think
before you do these things?

155
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,299
I did. I put myself right in your place.

156
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,421
I knew that you'd have bought her
if you'd been in my place.

157
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,004
What's the use? I give up!

158
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:46,184
I do too, I guess.
He won't take my judgment on anything.

159
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,783
- Hey, Ken.
- Yes, sir?

160
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,576
I've changed my mind.
I'll let you keep the mare.

161
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,117
- You will? Gee, that's great...
- Wait. Under these conditions.

162
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,710
She's your responsibility,
and she'll have to pay for her own keep.

163
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,748
Once she's brought back her costs,
then we'll take you into partnership.

164
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,378
That's very fair of you, Dad.
Thank you. And you too, Mom.

165
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,766
There's one other little matter.
Might as well let you have it all at once.

166
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,425
- Yes, sir?
- Beaver Greenway was just here.

167
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:31,768
- Thunderhead stole another one of his mares.
- Thunderhead did?

168
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,147
But we don't even know he's alive.

169
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:40,488
Well, if he is, Beaver's gonna shoot him.
And if I see him first, I'm afraid I'll have to.

170
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,070
<i>(neighing)</i>

171
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,514
- So that's your surprise!
- You like her?

172
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,313
From here I'd say she looks pretty good.

173
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,857
Come on, baby, show her your stuff.

174
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,570
Now, settle down. Easy, girl.

175
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,149
Easy. Trot. Trot.

176
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,697
Trot.

177
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,081
Whoa. Settle down. Trot.

178
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,839
Ah, stop that. Behave yourself.

179
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,042
- She's a little green yet.
- Yes, I can see that.

180
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:44,010
Now, come on. Come on, baby,
you know better than that. Trot.

181
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,976
- I believe she's got something.
- I got a hunch the moment I laid eyes on her.

182
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,552
Whoa! That's enough for today.
Whoa, Jewel.

183
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,390
- Jewel?
- Yeah. Crown Jewel.

184
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:57,526
That's a nice name. I like it.
She's blowing. Have you worked her hard?

185
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,149
No, it's the altitude. It got her at first,

186
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,023
but soon she'll have lung power
and stamina to burn. Won't you, baby?

187
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,822
- You look at a horse the way my father did.
- I do?

188
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,454
Mother used to say,

189
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:13,035
"If you looked at me the way you look at
your prize hunter, I'd faint with delight."

190
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,330
Must've been quite a guy,
your father. Thanks.

191
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,497
Come on, Jewel.

192
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,094
There we are. Be a good girl
and I'll get you some hay.

193
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,713
- You throw it down and I'll give it to her.
- OK.

194
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,771
- Is that all you're giving her?
- Isn't it enough?

195
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,564
It wouldn't be for my horses.

196
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,147
- Oh, Ken!
<i>- (Laughs)</i>

197
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,032
How was that?

198
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:49,736
Ken, what are you doing?! <i>(coughs)</i>

199
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,830
- Hey, where's the ladder?
- Ladder? What ladder?

200
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,258
- Come on, put it back.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,633
You don't, eh?

202
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,883
Hey! Cut it out!

203
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,389
So that's the way you want to play.

204
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,559
Oh, Ken!

205
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,657
- I'm sorry.
- You are? Why?

206
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,910
- I shouldn't be roughhousing with you.
- You didn't hurt me.

207
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,037
That's not what I mean.

208
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:37,458
You seem different today, somehow.

209
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,459
Maybe it's because you've never
looked at me before - really.

210
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,383
No. I guess I never did.

211
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,718
I'd better get to work.
I promised Dad I'd fix the corral fence.

212
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,220
- I'll help you.
- Building fences is a man's job.

213
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,674
Oh.

214
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,769
Very well. If I'm in the way, then I'll go home.

215
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:59,188
No, don't go. I'm glad you came.

216
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:03,272
I was thinking yesterday that you haven't
been over to go riding for a while.

217
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,565
- I can't be coming over here all the time.
- Why not?

218
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,693
I have a home too,
in case anybody should be interested.

219
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,951
- You mean I should come to see you?
- Are you asking for a date?

220
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,621
- Well, I...
- Saturday evening would be the best time.

221
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,081
We don't have a radio to dance to,

222
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,546
but from our porch you can almost hear
the dance music from Cave Lakes.

223
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,419
- I'll bet it's beautiful.
- Do you like to dance?

224
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,508
- You mean we have a date?
- Well... sure!

225
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,886
Saturday evening.

226
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,528
- Hey, Ken!
- Shh!

227
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,484
We're having dinner
an hour early for him and he's late.

228
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:54,533
He'll be right down. And don't kid him.
Remember, it's his first date.

229
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,112
I won't say a word.

230
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:12,503
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's perfectly all right, dear.

231
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:16,642
Well, pardon me. Haven't I seen
that necktie someplace before?

232
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,435
Yes, sir. It's yours.

233
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,897
My tie. Don't you think it's a little bit
early for you to start using my things?

234
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,186
- After all, we're not partners yet.
- No, sir.

235
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,362
Hey, uh... what'd you do to your chin?

236
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,654
- Oh, nothing, it's just a little...
- Cut.

237
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,067
Cut? How on earth did...?

238
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,996
- It couldn't possibly be a razor cut, could it?
- Rob!

239
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,998
- You have been using my razor, haven't you?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,203
- You see, I've got a date.
- A date?!

241
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,839
- With Carey Greenway, I suppose?
- Yes, sir.

242
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,843
- Planning to take her dancing, I suppose?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,965
And after that, to Red Slade's
for some supper, I suppose?

244
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:58,058
- Yes, sir.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

245
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,393
Here's five bucks. Have a good time.

246
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,556
Well, thanks.

247
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,759
Your supper's on the table.

248
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,863
Carey.

249
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,657
Carey!

250
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,717
Carey!

251
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,473
It's me, ducky.

252
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,927
I only had one drink. Just a little one.

253
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,934
- You'd better go down and have your supper.
- Doggone it, I was cold.

254
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:31,686
I've been up in those hills searching
for that stallion. It's just discouraging.

255
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,147
You know I don't want to drink.
I hate the stuff.

256
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,360
But somehow everything's
been going wrong with me lately.

257
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,859
But don't think I haven't been trying.

258
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,039
- I thought you were going to work Sundown.
- Tomorrow.

259
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,825
Tomorrow I'll get Sundown going
like he's never gone before.

260
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,546
We'll enter him in the Governor's Stake,
and then everything'll be peaches and cream.

261
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,468
It's always going to be
peaches and cream tomorrow.

262
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:59,420
There you go, discouraging me again.
Honest, ducky, I promise.

263
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:03,808
First thing in the morning I'll hook up
Sundown and get going. Is it a bargain?

264
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,349
- It is if you mean it.
- Sure I mean it.

265
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:10,187
You'll see. This old boy isn't finished yet.
Not by ajugful.

266
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,609
By ginger, we're gonna win that race.
I feel it in my bones.

267
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:17,823
We'll get my farm back in Connecticut.
I'll drive in the Grand Circuit again.

268
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,775
- And you'll have a trunkful of pretty dresses.
- Grandpa, please!

269
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,779
Well, you will.

270
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:29,626
Say, let me look at you. You look real swell.
How come you're all rigged out like that?

271
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:34,457
- I've got a date. With Ken McLaughlin.
- Didn't I tell you about those McLaughlins?

272
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,835
- You know, they have a trotter too.
- Huh?

273
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:42,139
A beautiful black mare. I think they're
going to get her ready for Lancaster too.

274
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,008
First they steal my mares,
now they want to win the Governor's Stake.

275
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,179
They will if you don't get busy.

276
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:53,017
A fine chance they have of beating Beaver
Greenway, those Johnny-come-latelies.

277
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,435
You stay away from those McLaughlins.

278
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,771
Go down and have your supper.

279
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,272
You heard me, now.

280
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,284
McLaughlins.

281
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,834
Stealing my horses.

282
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:16,496
Buying a trotting mare, eh?

283
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,818
Hello, Mr Greenway. Nice evening.

284
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,078
- I hear you got a trotter.
- Yes, sir. She looks like a winner.

285
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,703
- She does, eh?
- Well, I think so. Is Carey ready?

286
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,458
- She ain't going out tonight.
- She isn't? Why? Is she sick?

287
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:58,544
- Yeah. Sick of McLaughlins.
- What? Oh, you're kidding.

288
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:02,466
I am, am I? Well, suppose you just scat.

289
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:07,050
- Carey and I have a date to go dancing.
- Just dance yourself back home.

290
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,716
- Does Carey know about this?
- I told you to scat.

291
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,100
Now, when I say scat, I mean scat.

292
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:14,228
So... scat.

293
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,059
OK.

294
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,856
- Hey, Ken.
- Yes, sir?

295
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,196
Don't get no idea in your head
your mare can beat Sundown.

296
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,608
No horse can touch him
when he's going good.

297
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,402
- That's what you think.
- That's what I know.

298
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,376
Huh.

299
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,078
Thinks he can beat Sundown, eh?
The young squirt.

300
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,248
<i>(door opens)</i>

301
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,051
Where's Ken? I thought I heard him.

302
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,848
- Well, he...
- I did, didn't I?

303
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:52,054
Yeah, that was him, all right.

304
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:57,222
- Grandpa, you didn't...
- Stay away from the McLaughlins.

305
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,104
How could you do such a thing?

306
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,769
You know how much I wanted to go dancing.

307
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:08,488
But when you're drinking, you're...
you're just impossible. I'm ashamed of you!

308
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,536
Carey! Carey!

309
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,707
Carey, wait! Don't be mad at me!

310
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,870
Come back, ducky!

311
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,842
I didn't mean to hurt you.

312
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,666
Ken!

313
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,420
- I didn't think I'd make it.
- Neither did I. What goes on?

314
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:09,555
- Do you still want to take me to the dance?
- Do I? Home, Jasper, and thanks.

315
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,719
I must look a fright.

316
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:15,095
- Am I all wrinkled and blown to pieces?
- The wrinkles'll come out and I have a comb.

366
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:05,268

- Carey, you've got to have fun sometime.

367
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,607
Your grandfather can't just
tie you down all your life.

368
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:12,941
I know, but he'll be worried,
and there's no telling what he might do.

He's been drinking again.

Yes.

00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,084

- Yeah. Music's good, too.

373
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,930
Oh, Ken, what am I going to do
with my grandfather?

374
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,636
- He's quite a problem.
- He doesn't mean to be.

375
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:45,222
It's just that he's getting old and he's lonely.
He depends upon me so much.

376
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:50,189
If I don't take good care of him and get him
straightened out, he won't be a success again.

377
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,946
- Maybe you're not handling him right.
- How do you mean?

378
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,984
You know the old saying -
"Take the bull by the horns."

379
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:58,447
You think I should put my foot down more?

380
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,702
- I would if he was my grandfather.
- Maybe you're right.

381
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,620
If I go home now, he'll think
he's won his point, that I'm just a child.

382
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,369
Now you're talking.

383
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:10,296
But... if I don't go...

384
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,456
Come on.

385
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:16,552
- Just one more?
- You bet!

386
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,979
She left me.

387
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,141
My little ducky.

388
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:35,228
I shouldn't have
chased that boy away, Sundown.

389
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,023
No, sir. I shouldn't have done it.

390
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:43,696
I don't know why I do some of the things I do.

391
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,916
Maybe I'm just naturally mean.

392
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:53,000
But I've never been mean to you,
have I, Sundown?

393
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,497
I'm gonna get you out of this place.

394
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:59,756
I'm gonna get you a nice clean barn
and a paddock deep in clover.

395
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:04,224
Tomorrow, first thing in the morning,
I'm gonna hook you up.

396
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,800
We'll show 'em, by ginger.

397
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,827
Yes, sir. We'll show 'em.

398
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,535
Remember when we won
the Walnut Hall Cup at Lexington?

399
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,126
That was a great day.

400
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,256
A great day.

401
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,134
But look at us now.

402
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,347
Just look what's happened to us now.

403
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,074
But don't you worry.

404
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:07,113
We'll do it again. Yes, sir,
everything's gonna be just as it was.

405
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,531
You just watch.

406
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,997
We'll get our farm back in Connecticut.

407
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,493
And we'll drive the Grand Circuit again.

408
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:18,835
And we'll get Carey
a whole trunkful of pretty dresses.

00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,350
Well, you're right.

412
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,431

- Good morning, ducky!

- Haven't I told you so all along?

00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,240
We'll get him this time.

482
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,425
Jewel!

483
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:22,814
Thunderhead!

484
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,483
Jewel!

485
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,671
Jewel!

486
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:04,773
- He didn't come this way.
- I told you we took the wrong trail.

487
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:06,815
Won't nobody listen to me?

488
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:10,852
- I could've sworn they came this way.
- You're trying to protect Thunderhead.

489
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:14,566
When he's got a mare that's stood me $2200?
You think I'm crazy?

490
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,788
- Yeah.
- It's kinda late in the day to get all het up.

491
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:22,455
A little drop of kindness... we'll head back.

492
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,130
- Wet your whistle, Joe.
- Thanks.

493
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:35,547
Here, Beaver. Settle your nerves.

494
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:40,931
Oh...

495
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,977
I'm not that nervous.

496
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:44,771
Giddap.

497
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,941
- Well.
- That's a new wrinkle for Beaver.

498

What have you done with Jewel?

502
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:11,058
Come back here!

503
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:22,440
Jewel. How in the world
did you get in that fix?

504
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:35,497
Easy.

505
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,379
Easy, baby.

506
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:49,797
Come on, Flicka.

507
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:51,802
Easy.

508
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:05,149
Easy, girl.

509
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:16,209
Got to help yourself this time, baby.

510
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:24,882
That's it.

511
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,219
Whoa, Jewel.

512
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:35,103
Whoa, girl.

513
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:39,103

Well, so do I.
You just rest here a minute with Flicka.

517
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:58,283
Maybe we'll take him home with us.

518
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:00,418
Come on, boy.

519
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:02,831
Come on. <i>(Whistles softly)</i>

<i>(Jewel breathes heavily)</i>

524
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,661
How does she look, Doc?

525
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:30,259
- She'll be all right, won't she?
- I don't think so, Ken.

526
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:32,753
With the leg, you've got
nothing to worry about,

527
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:37,474
but her lungs are so badly congested
that I'm afraid there's nothing else I can do.

528
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:41,689
- But you can't just give up.
- I'm sorry, Ken, I've done my best.

529
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:46,479
- If she were my mare, I'd destroy her.
- Destroy her?!

530
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:51,906
- Do you want me to...?
- No. No, we'll attend to that, thanks.

531
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,652
Hey, Gus.

532
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,754
- Dad, there must be something we can do.
- If there was, we'd try it, but there isn't.

533
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,291
You know we would. We don't want
to destroy Jewel any more than you do.

534
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:11,211
Go with your mother, son.

535
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:15,965
No, wait. You're not gonna shoot her. I'm not
as smart as Dr Kimbro, but he can be wrong.

536
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:20,518
- Don't make things any worse.
- We've got to be sensible, son.

537
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:24,187
Jewel's in terrible pain.
We can't let her go on suffering.

538
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:30,229
But if she were a sick person you wouldn't
give up. Let me try. I'll help her, I know I will.

539
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,157
If she's gonna die anyway...

540
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:38,491
that can't do her any harm.

541
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,203
Giving up too easy, Jewel.

542
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:49,501
He's right, Rob. Let him try it.

543
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:53,541
A horse ain't never dead till he's dead, boss.

544
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:03,936
All right, son. And I wish you luck.

545
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:06,808
Thanks.

546
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:10,190
I'll find a way, Jewel.

547
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:12,567
I know I will.

548
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:37,421
Congestion-reducer
and the distemper remedy didn't help much?

549
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:41,132
- No, sir.
- Well, now, here. You try that.

550
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:46,932
The directions are right on the bottle.
That'll be a dollar and a quarter.

551
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:51,433
- Let me know how it works out.
- OK.

552
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,066
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello.

553
00:51:55,157 --> 00:51:59,783
- I hear Jewel's very sick.
- If this doesn't work, we have to destroy her.

554
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:02,990
- I'm sorry.
- Well, so long.

555
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:09,828
- I wish we could help him.
- Doing all they know how, ain't they?

556
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:12,210
- I suppose so.
- Can't do more than that.

557
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:17,506
- What'll you have, Beaver?
- Oh, hiya, Mort. Couple of sacks of oats.

558
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:26,437
She was such a beautiful mare.

559
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:30,514
It's a shame.

560
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:36,061
Seems to me, if I had a mare
with a congested lung...

561
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:39,691
Well, there's a lot of
old-fashioned tricks a man can play.

562
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:43,569
- Like what?
- These new-fangled vets wouldn't approve...

563
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:46,415
Well, if I had a horse with a congested lung,

564
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,501
I'd try some aromatic oils and hot water,

565
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:53,798
and let her breathe the fumes up
through her nostrils. That might help.

566
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,341
- You think so?
- It might.

567
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:58,177
- Why didn't you tell Ken?
- He didn't ask me.

568
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:01,428
- Oh, Grandpa!
- Hey! Come back here!

569
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,269
Hey, Mort, better hold those oats.

570
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,193
Looks like I won't have a car for a while.

571
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:18,400
- That's enough.
- Now the oil.

572
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:26,786
- Smells awful.
- I don't care how it smells if it works.

573
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,828
Here we are, baby.

574
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:34,165
There. That's going to
make you feel much better.

575
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:43,757
Those kids are still with that mare. Carey
should be at home and he should be in bed.

576
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:49,009
Oh, let them alone. You used to pick on Ken
for starting something and never finishing it.

577
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:51,725
All right. He's your son.

578
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,140
- I don't...
<i>- (Chuckles)</i>

579
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:57,235
- She's breathing easier now.
- Yeah.

580
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:00,903
Gee, your grandfather's a funny guy.
I thought he didn't like me.

581
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,692
Then he tipped me off to this.
I guess I just don't understand him.

582
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:07,740
I have a hard time
understanding him myself sometimes.

583
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,740
I'll bet.

584
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:14,709
You've been swell, Carey. It's wonderful to
have someone stick by you at a time like this.

585
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:19,126
- You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you?
- Sure I would.

586
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:24,295
You know, it's funny.
I never used to notice what you looked like.

587
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:28,141
- Then, all of a sudden...
- Now, don't get moony!

588
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:30,303
I'm not.

589
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:32,933
I just wanted to say that...

590
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:36,809
Oh, forget it.

- Look, Dad, I told you. She's better!
- Good work.

He's coming over here tomorrow.

That's a beautiful mess. Look at that stall.
Come on, get her out of there.

618
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,738
Holy smoke. Did she cut herself, boss?

619
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:36,991
- I don't know. Let me have a look at her.
- I wonder what's the matter with her now.

620
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:41,411
Do you know what, Kenny? I think
she's in love. She misses Thunderhead.

621
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:44,255
- Yeah. It might be Thunderhead.
- Sure it is.

622
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:47,376
I'll bet he's hanging around here
someplace right now.

623
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:52,675
As far as I can see, she's OK.
Let's put her in this stall here.

624
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,641
- Now let's get some sleep.
- Go ahead, Dad. I'll stay here for a while.

00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:09,187
- All right.
- Good night, Kenny. You ought to sleep too.

You'd better behave tomorrow, young lady.

<i>- (Whinnies)</i>

Sure you do.

631

- What do you think, Mr Willis?
- Ain't what a man thinks, it's what he knows.

632
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,576
Well, uh, what do you know?

633
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:01,622
I've seen worse.

- Didn't say she wasn't.

- Well?
- More folks asking questions.

- That's what you came here for.
- I thought it was my company you was after.

637
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:24,138
You got a good square-gaited trotter, Rob.
Might be able to do something with her.

638
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:29,356
- Then you mean you're gonna take her?
- Well, looking her over casual like I've been,

639
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:34,190
I'd say she's a whale of a prospect.
Bring her over to my place Saturday.

00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:52,168
Whoa! Whoa, Jewel!

644
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:01,559
Whoa, now. Whoa there, gal.

645
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:06,519
- Here. Behave yourself.
- Hold her. Come on, let's unhitch her.

646
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:09,643
- What happened?
- Something must have frightened her.

647
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,356
Looks like I got a job on my hands, Ken.

648
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:16,444
You won't have any trouble.
I guess Dad and I just started her wrong.

649
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:20,578
You ought to have her in a breaking cart,
not that thing. That comes later.

650
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:23,948
Here, put her up, Ken.

651
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,916
<i>(neighs)</i>

652
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:37,294
- Listen. That's Thunderhead.
- I told you.

653
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:41,599
- She's trying to get to Thunderhead.
- If we don't put her away quick, she might.

654
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:52,059
<i>(neighing)</i>

655
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:58,071
Gus, look!

656
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:03,535
- Yeah. He's coming after her all right.
- Yeah.

657
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:10,919
- Oh, no wonder Jewel acted up.
- He'll hang around till he gets her back.

658
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:14,005
Or gets shot. Hey, Ken, get my rifle.

659
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:18,292
Go ahead. Hurry it up.

660
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:31,267
Well, that brazen son of a gun...

661
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,809
Ken, I told you to get my rifle.

662
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:37,359
<i>(banging and neighing)</i>

663
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:41,825
- Keep an eye on Thunderhead!
- Come back here and do as I told you!

664
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:44,615
Look at him.
I could hit him with a rock. Kenny!

665
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:49,117
He's come after you, Jewel.
Now's our chance to catch him.

666
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:52,993
- Come on, baby.
- What are you trying to do?

667
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:55,330
- Catch Thunderhead.
- She'll get away.

668
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:57,547
She won't. I can handle her.

669
01:01:57,634 --> 01:02:00,304
Now we'll lose her again.

670
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,300
Easy. Easy, girl. Easy. Easy.

671
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:11,187
Talk to him, Jewel.

672
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:13,230
Talk to him.

673
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:14,859
That's it.

674
01:02:17,237 --> 01:02:19,029
That's it.

675
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:21,570
Whoa, boy. Here she is, boy.

676
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:24,776
Don't be afraid, boy.

677
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:30,078
Watch yourself, son.

678
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:37,296
Watch it.

679
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:49,218
Look out.

680
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,896
Jump off her, Ken!
You want to get killed?

681
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:34,055
You've had this wild-goose chase
for nothing, my boy.

682
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:39,272
That won't do you any good either.

683
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:45,067
You're coming back to the ranch with me,
Thunderhead. Coming home. Understand?

684
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:48,076
You want to come back, don't you?

685
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:51,613
Sure you do.

686
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:54,992
Easy. Steady, son.

687
01:03:56,044 --> 01:03:58,333
You're not afraid.

688
01:03:59,423 --> 01:04:02,340
Thunderhead! Come back here!

689
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,515
If you go free now, they'll shoot you.
You won't have a chance.

690
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,806
Come on, boy.

691
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:15,052
<i>(whistles softly)</i>

692
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:18,975
Come on, boy.

693
01:04:22,738 --> 01:04:25,443
All right, Jewel. We'll go.

694
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:47,929
I thought you'd change your mind.

695
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:51,344
Ah, stop that.

696
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,260
Just take it easy, now.

697
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:56,263
Steady.

698
01:04:57,898 --> 01:04:59,772
Steady.

699
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:03,314
That's it.

700
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:06,404
Everything's gonna be all right.

701
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:08,566
Easy, son.

702
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:11,066
Easy, now.

703
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:13,035
Steady.

704
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,327
That's it.

705
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:22,669
That's it.

706
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:24,630
Sure.

707
01:05:26,468 --> 01:05:28,959
Steady now.

708
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:31,255
Steady now.

709
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:37,304
All right, boy. Let's go home.

710
01:05:37,396 --> 01:05:39,638
Come on, Jewel.

711
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:49,690
How do you like that?

712
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,406
Whether I like it or not, it looks like
I've got that stud in the family again.

713
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:04,331
<i>(Gus) Now that Thunderhead was
home to stay, Jewel was as happy as a lark.</i>

714
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:08,883
<i>But she wouldn't work a lick unless
the old boy was right on the track with her.</i>

715
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:13,970
<i>Then pretty soon
she settled down and worked fine.</i>

716
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:18,600
<i>Just as long as she knew
Thunderhead was close by.</i>

717
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,931
You're still sawing at her mouth.

718
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:25,817
Look at her.

719
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:33,608
- Looks like I'll never get it.
- Oh, yes, you will.

720
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:37,071
Just sit up straight and ease off on your lines.

721
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:40,497
You talk to a horse
with your voice and your hands.

722
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:44,498
Your hands are light,
you talk gentle and encouraging.

723
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:47,708
When they're heavy,
you're talking mean and ugly.

724
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:50,290
- I'll try, Jake.
- Yeah.

725
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,923
You know, Jewel carries her head to the left.

726
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:55,800
Oh, I'll show you how to fix that.

727
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:57,765
<i>(Gus) Jake was a smart old codger.</i>

728
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:01,801
<i>The sawed-off billiard cue
made Jewel trot as straight as you please.</i>

729
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:08,516
<i>And the sheepskin roll... Well, that stopped
her from seeing shadows and being scared.</i>

730
01:07:08,612 --> 01:07:11,068
<i>She kept improving every day,</i>

731
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:15,984
<i>and it wasn't long before Jake figured she was
ready to step out and show some real speed.</i>

732
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:20,407
Let her step around at about a 250 gait,
but come the last quarter in 32.

733
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:21,332
OK.

734
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:24,500
We gotta teach her to leave the wire fast
and come home fast.

735
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:36,548
Pull up to the wire.
I want to see how good that mare is.

736
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,180
- Ken'll think we're spying on him, Grandpa.
- That's what we're doing. Pull up to the wire.

737
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,861
<i>(Jake)</i> Now.

738
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:32,571
She made that last quarter
in 32 and two-fifths.

739
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:38,325
- Not bad for a green trotter.
- Not bad. Not bad at all. Pretty good, in fact.

740
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:45,950
Let's go down and congratulate the boy.

741
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:49,459
- How was it?
- The mare looked pretty good.

742
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:52,583
Now you've got to learn
some of the manoeuvres and ethics.

743
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:59,216
- Huh. What's that old scallywag up to?
- He's just curious, I guess.

744
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:02,177
He's curious all right.
Didn't learn nothing, though.

745
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:06,846
Nice work, boys. Nice work. How are you,
Jake? The little mare looks great, son.

746
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:09,893
- You've done wonders with her, Ken.
- Mr Willis has.

747
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:13,732
Well, there's plenty to do yet.
You can see that, can't you, Beaver?

748
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,984
- Well, I wasn't watching very close.
- Yeah? Better cool her off, put her away.

749
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:20,696
- OK. Wanna help me, Carey?
- I'd love to.

750
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:22,909
She hardly turned a hair.

751
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:26,994
- That little mare of yours has what it takes.
- That's something coming from you.

752
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:30,784
You can't tell what's inside her
unless you get in real competition.

753
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,964
Then it's drivers that count
as much as horses.

754
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:37,050
The best horse ain't worth a lick
with a greenhorn behind him.

755
01:09:37,135 --> 01:09:41,465
- Ken is not exactly a greenhorn, Grandpa.
- Course he ain't. Who said he was?

756
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:43,882
- And it's a good thing too.
- Yeah? Why?

757
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:48,305
Greenhorns always freeze to the reins
when the going gets tough.

758
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:52,062
Especially when they get pocketed
by three or four wise old joes like me.

759
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,265
Grandpa!

760
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:57,061
I remember once in Lexington
there was a kid there about your age.

761
01:09:57,155 --> 01:10:01,023
He was driving his first race, too.
He got pocketed down by the rail.

762
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:03,407
The driver in front pulled up unexpectedly,

763
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:07,244
and that kid's horse put his foot
smack in the other fella's wheel.

764
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:10,618
- What happened?
- They had to destroy both those horses.

765
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,869
That kid never drove another race.

766
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:16,083
- I think we'd better go.
- Yes, I guess it's time.

767
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,962
Don't you worry, son.
You're doing fine. Just fine.

768
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:21,128
See you later, Ken.

769
01:10:25,142 --> 01:10:28,926
Why'd you tell him those terrible things?
You scared him half to death.

770
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:32,853
Who, me? I was just trying
to give the kid a few pointers.

771
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:37,521
<i>(Gus) It was a long drive,</i>

772
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:41,824
<i>but here we were at Lancaster, Ohio,
the heart of the trotting-horse country.</i>

773
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:45,443
<i>The fairground was already
waking up to some real activity.</i>

774
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:48,704
<i>Those horses were pouring in
from every state in the union</i>

775
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:51,364
<i>to compete for the Governor's Cup.</i>

776
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:56,751
<i>How was I betting? I'd just planked down
a week's pay on Jewel's nose.</i>

777
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,042
<i>(honks horn)</i>

778
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:03,553
<i>(Thunderhead neighs)</i>

779
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:09,643
- Thunderhead thinks we're gonna race him.
- I just hope he behaves himself.

780
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:14,057
I hope you stop growing
and spreading out all over the seat.

781
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:22,403
Ah, there's nothing like the smell of the
fairground in trotting season. Or a good cigar.

782
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:28,659
You didn't think I'd make it, did you, ducky?
Well, I fooled you, and I'll fool everybody else.

783
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:33,124
We'll have my farm back in Connecticut.
I'll follow the Grand Circuit, and...

784
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,783
Grandpa, you could lose, you know.

785
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:38,666
There are other good horses in the race
besides Sundown.

786
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:43,964
You can cheer for that McLaughlin boy if you
want, but just a couple of times, to be polite.

787
01:11:50,143 --> 01:11:54,473
<i>(PA) Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready for
the 26th running of the Governor's Stake.</i>

788
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:56,474
<i>14-class trotters.</i>

789
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:59,140
<i>A purse of $5,000 added.</i>

790
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:01,905
<i>The best two in three.</i>

791
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:10,493
A smart driver's always out to win.
You've got a young mare.

792
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:15,788
The sooner you bring her in, the better.
Don't take any chances. Good luck.

793
01:12:18,589 --> 01:12:20,795
<i>Eight starters are being led to the post</i>

794

whom we welcome back to our sport.</i>

805
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:05,083
<i>No.8, Cosharo, Boston Shilling.</i>

806
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:08,877
Sundown looks fine. It's sure great
to see old Beaver out there again.

807
01:13:08,972 --> 01:13:12,555
That's where he belongs, Mr McLaughlin.

808
01:13:12,643 --> 01:13:17,305
<i>(PA) On the inside, we have Mr Dunwiddy
and Mr Evers and Ken McLaughlin.</i>

809
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:19,224
<i>(whinnies)</i>

810
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:23,975
Take 'em on up there, gentlemen. Well up.
Everybody turn 'em, now.

811
01:13:24,071 --> 01:13:27,440
<i>Dr Parshall, your horse is at the rail.
Let him get down to you.</i>

812
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:32,444
<i>McLaughlin, get over a little bit farther.
Come on, Greenway, get your horse up there.</i>

813
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:38,042
<i>Wait on him on the outside here now. Careful
with him. Not too fast. Let this horse through.</i>

814
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:39,621
<i>Very nice. Go!</i>

815
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:45,122
<i>It's Dillola Lord on top. Caroline C's second.</i>

816
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:49,262
<i>- Crown Jewel third, Sundown fourth...
- (neighs)</i>

817
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:53,970
Don't worry, boy. She knows you're here.

818
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:56,060
<i>...Crown Jewel.</i>

819
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:59,430
Coming up that back lane,
Dillola Lord out in front by a length.

820
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:02,275
It's Caroline C second.

821
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:04,186
<i>Crown Jewel is third.</i>

822
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:07,481
<i>Coming around here now, still Dillola Lord.</i>

823
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:13,323
<i>Crown Jewel is trotting very fast into second
position. Sundown has moved up to third.</i>

824
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:17,990
<i>Greenway making a drive now
to improve his position with Sundown.</i>

825
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:19,661
Come on, Grandpa!

826
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:20,831
Grandpa!

827
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:23,327
<i>...Crown Jewel, Sundown.</i>

828
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:30,468
Come on! Come on, Grandpa!

829
01:14:30,554 --> 01:14:33,175
<i>It's still Dillola Lord.</i>

830
01:14:33,265 --> 01:14:35,886
Come on, Kenny! Now's the time to let her go!

831
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:39,392
<i>It's still Dillola Lord...</i>

832
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,017
Now, Jewel. Come on, girl. Let's go.

833
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:45,191
<i>...Crown Jewel. Here she comes.
Passes Dillola Lord...</i>

834
01:14:45,277 --> 01:14:46,771
<i>(neighs)</i>

835
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,142
That's the stuff, Kenny!

836
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:50,445
- Ken took the lead.
- It's still anybody's.

837
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:51,730
You bet it is.

838
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,493
<i>And it's still Crown Jewel.
Sundown is on her trail.</i>

839
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,955
Coming through!

840
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,290
<i>Greenway makes his drive.
He leads up to the side of her.</i>

841
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:04,413
<i>Here they are racing neck and neck
and side by side now.</i>

842
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:09,048
<i>Looky here. There's a little trouble back there.
And Mr Greenway has his wheel locked in...</i>

843
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:11,506
- Get off me!
- Keep your shirt on!

844
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:13,422
Watch him. He's a trickster.

845
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:19,971
<i>They're coming out of it. Still Crown Jewel.
Sundown moves up beside her.</i>

846
01:15:20,062 --> 01:15:22,517
- Come on, Ken.
- Come on, Grandpa!

847
01:15:22,606 --> 01:15:25,856
<i>Jewel is trotting very fast now.
She's out on top again.</i>

848
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:28,778
<i>They're trotting like a pair.
They're side by side.</i>

849
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,938
Come on, Kenny! Let her go!

850
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:36,235
<i>Heading down the lane now. It's still
Sundown who's out on top by a length.</i>

851
01:15:36,328 --> 01:15:41,323
<i>Now it's Crown Jewel who's out in front.
She's a little ahead of him now.</i>

852
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,957
<i>And Crown Jewel is trotting fast
and Sundown is right at her.</i>

853
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:51,175
<i>And here they are...
Oh! Crown Jewel breaks her gait.</i>

854
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,422
Jewel's broke!

855
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:54,717
Uh-oh...

856
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:58,719
<i>...with Sundown. He's moving up to her.
Crown Jewel still on a break...</i>

857
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:01,514
- Get her back in her trot, Ken!
- Catch on to her, Kenny!

858
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:05,518
<i>Sundown is trotting fast. Here he comes
on the outside... He's the winner!</i>

859
01:16:05,607 --> 01:16:07,516
Come on!

860
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:12,821
Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

861
01:16:12,906 --> 01:16:17,367
- Oh, he won! He said he would and he did!
- Good. Good. Come on.

862
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,244
Oh!

863
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,916
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

864
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:27,243
You made a nice try. What happened?

865
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:31,169
Jewel lost her shoe. I hope it didn't hit her.

866
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:40,216
- There you are. Go out and win the next heat.
- I'd better.

867
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,678
We ain't worried about it, are we, Jewel?

868
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:46,688
Hey, Ken. You know what I'd do if I were you?

869
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:50,522
- No. What?
- I'd take me a walk. It's good for the nerves.

870
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:54,062
Maybe you'll hear the nice things
people are saying about your driving.

871
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:56,825
That might do me some good.

872
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:02,659
Rob, if Ken loses,
what about the partnership?

873
01:17:03,498 --> 01:17:09,371
No. Not until the mare pays for herself.
That was the deal.

874
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:13,626
If you're back in the game to stay, Beaver,
I'll put some horses in your stable.

875
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:15,674
I'll be proud to have 'em.

876
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:19,296
I never expected to see old Sundown
trotting like that again.

877
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:22,841
Well, it's Sundown's legs,
but my hands and my head.

878
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,808
Carey.

879
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:31,693
Now, that McLaughlin boy has got a mare
with speed to burn, but he ain't gonna win.

880
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:36,320
Cos he ain't got it here nor here.
Has he, Sundown, huh?

881
01:17:36,406 --> 01:17:38,897
- Relish?
- No, thank you.

882
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:44,695
- Guess your grandpa figures on this heat too.
- He's out to win.

883
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:48,538
- So am I.
- It was awful watching that heat.

884
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:51,628
Oh, Ken. If only the both of you could win.

885
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:55,379
Yeah, I know. I'm kinda all mixed-up too.

886
01:17:55,467 --> 01:18:00,509
I want Jewel to win, but I hate to think what
it might do to your grandfather if he loses.

887
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:03,302
He hasn't touched a drop since the dance.

888
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:06,013
That's just what I mean.

889
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:10,599
Well, someone's got to win.
And if it isn't Grandpa, I hope it's you.

890
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:13,395
Good luck to both of us.

891
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:18,361
<i>(PA) Get up there. Get ready. Gentlemen,
trail them down the path at 80 yards now.</i>

892
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:24,035
Get them together this time. McLaughlin, get
your mare over there a little quicker, please.

893
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:27,287
- Into your position. You're in third position.
<i>- (Whinnies)</i>

894
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,912
<i>Up a little farther. Now let's all turn.</i>

895
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:31,745
<i>Easy.</i>

896
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,995
<i>Be careful now.</i>

897
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:36,580
<i>Wait for them in front. Wait, McLaughlin.</i>

898
01:18:36,675 --> 01:18:41,052
<i>Not too fast, McLaughlin.
Not too fast. Let them come.</i>

899
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,169
<i>Go!</i>

900
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:47,385
<i>Crown Jewel on top.</i>

901
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:51,261
<i>McLaughlin's setting a very fast pace
with his mare around the turn.</i>

902
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:56,268
<i>Then it's Dillola Lord in second.
Donald Ford is third. Sundown in fifth.</i>

903
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:59,031
<i>Still Crown Jewel on top.</i>

904
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:03,242
He's pushing her too hard.
Take a breather, Ken! Take a breather!

905
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:05,652
<i>He'll take his mare back to save her.</i>

906
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,785
You'll burn her out at that clip.

907
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:15,333
<i>It's Dillola Lord, Donald Ford, and
Crown Jewel is dropping back now to third.</i>

908
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,791
<i>It's Dillola Lord,
Donald Ford, Crown Jewel...</i>

909
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:21,636
- Take it easy, Kenny!
- Come on, Grandpa!

910
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,171
<i>Still Dillola Lord on top.
Donald Ford is second.</i>

911
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:30,058
<i>Mr McLaughlin makes a drive with his mare
and Greenway makes a drive with Sundown.</i>

912
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:35,187
<i>They're still moving up that back lane,
and now Crown Jewel comes to the top again,</i>

913
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:39,688
<i>followed by Miss Bosise moving up
on the outside. Here's a new one in here.</i>

914
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:43,065
<i>It's Miss Bosise moving up
to the side of Crown Jewel.</i>

915
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,323
We got you now, greenhorn!

916
01:19:46,203 --> 01:19:51,909
<i>Now Miss Bosise is going to the top.
Crown Jewel is still second, Sundown is third.</i>

917
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:55,960
- Is it Grandpa?
- No, it's No.6.

918
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:58,169
<i>Dunwiddy is coming out of that wreck.</i>

919
01:19:58,257 --> 01:20:01,507
- Is he all right?
- He's all right. He's on his feet.

920
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:06,006
<i>Dillola Lord is third. Around that turn now,
and it's still Crown Jewel.</i>

921
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:10,178
<i>Looking back to see how close Sundown is.
He's right on his wheel now.</i>

922
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:12,261
Grandpa'll make his move now. Watch.

923
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:14,845
<i>Here they are.
It's Crown Jewel. It's Sundown.</i>

924
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:16,315
Sundown!

925
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,611
<i>Crown Jewel is still on top.
Sundown moving up on even terms with her.</i>

926
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:23,899
- Here he comes. I told you!
- Come on, Ken!

927
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,114
Come on, Kenny! Come on, Kenny!

928
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,692
<i>It's Sundown
who's got the slight advantage.</i>

929
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:31,864
Watch it, Ken.

930
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:36,952
<i>...like a pair again. And what a race it's
going to be. It's Crown Jewel with Sundown.</i>

931
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:38,623
Come on, Kenny.

932
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:41,335
<i>...and neck to neck. And what a finish...</i>

933
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:43,049
Come on, Sundown!

934
01:20:43,135 --> 01:20:46,338
<i>There's Crown Jewel on the inside
and Sundown on the outside.</i>

935
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:49,514
Now's the time, Kenny!
Now's the time. Turn her loose!

936
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,723
<i>Now Crown Jewel moves away.</i>

937
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,602
He's making his move!

938
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:55,763
Come on, Grandpa!

939
01:20:56,315 --> 01:21:00,359
<i>It's Sundown almost on her wheel again.</i>

940
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:06,149
<i>It's Crown Jewel out to a slight advantage.
And here she is. Crown Jewel, the winner!</i>

941
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,234
<i>(neighs)</i>

942
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,446
Whoo-hoo! That's our boy!

943
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:18,290
- Ken was wonderful!
- Come on. Let's go see him.

944
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:22,919
You tried, Sundown.

945
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:25,084
So did I.

946
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:28,710
It's not good enough.

947
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:36,600
This heat'll be the tough one,
so keep your eyes and your ears open.

948
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:39,606
Old Beaver knows a lot of tricks
you never even heard of.

949
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:43,903
- He'll probably use every last one of them...
<i>- (Man)</i> Five minutes!

950
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:49,148
Get your horses ready for the class-14 trot!
Get your horses ready...

951
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:51,947
<i>(man ♪2)</i> We'll be ready, boss.

952
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:07,092
- What are you looking for, Grandpa?
- Oh, I thought I'd put a shadow roll on him.

953
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:11,969
- But why?
- Well, he kind of shied the last time.

954
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:16,351
Sundown doesn't need
a shadow roll to win, Grandpa.

955
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:19,556
And you don't need anything either.

956
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:25,189
<i>In this third heat of the Governor's Stake,</i>

957
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:29,572
<i>you're going to see some keen competition
between these two heat winners.</i>

958
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:35,821
Dr Parshall, you know where to take that
horse. Around the rail and come down slow.

959
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:38,370
<i>McLaughlin, try to get your mare rounded out.</i>

960
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:42,919
<i>You boys are not obeying the rules very well.
You know what to do with them.</i>

961
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:46,255
<i>Parshall, turn slow.
McLaughlin, in there where you belong.</i>

962
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,797
- Ken's too anxious.
- Easy, son. Easy.

963
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:51,421
This is the heat that counts.

964
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:55,677
<i>Everybody be careful. Watch your horse
at the rail. Don't try to beat him away.</i>

965
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:58,305
<i>Easy now. Let's get these horses on the stride.</i>

966
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:04,765
Everybody on the trot now. That's very nice.
Not too fast. Not too fast. Go!

967
01:23:09,823 --> 01:23:12,492
Crown Jewel is now on the stride again.

968
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:16,194
It's still Dillola Lord,
and Miss Bosise on the outside is second.

969
01:23:16,288 --> 01:23:20,499
<i>Donald Ford is third and Crown Jewel
is fourth. And Sundown is fifth.</i>

970
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:22,375
<i>(whinnies)</i>

971
01:23:22,461 --> 01:23:26,245
<i>Around that turn,
it's still Dillola Lord, it's Donald Ford,</i>

972
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:29,625
<i>and it's now Miss Bosise third.</i>

973
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:31,794
<i>Crown Jewel and Sundown.</i>

974
01:23:31,887 --> 01:23:36,964
<i>Now it's still Dillola Lord. Crown Jewel
moving up to second position on the outside.</i>

975
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:40,926
<i>Donald Ford third and it's Sundown fourth.
It's still Dillola Lord.</i>

976
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:46,692
Get away! Don't put them in front of me!
Come on, Kenny!

977
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,776
<i>It's still Dillola Lord,</i>

978
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:52,188
<i>Crown Jewel, Sundown.</i>

979
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:56,150
<i>They're all going that short route now,
biding their time to make their drive.</i>

980
01:23:56,245 --> 01:24:00,741
<i>Greenway is making an effort
to get his horse in a better position now.</i>

981
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:05,411
<i>Still Dillola Lord and Crown Jewel. Greenway
has his horse right on McLaughlin's back.</i>

982
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:09,003
Look at Sundown.
Beaver's got him breathing down Ken's neck.

983
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:13,669
<i>Sundown is right on his back again.
Still going that short route.</i>

984
01:24:13,762 --> 01:24:15,968
He knows all the tricks. Come on, Kenny.

985
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:21,051
<i>Dillola Lord still on top. Crown Jewel
is still second and Sundown is third.</i>

986
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:22,603
Come on, girl. Let's go.

987
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:28,026
<i>McLaughlin makes his drive. He's coming
through. Crown Jewel passes Dillola Lord...</i>

988
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:31,194
- That's the boy, Kenny!
<i>- (Whinnies)</i>

989
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:36,610
<i>It's now Crown Jewel.
Sundown is second. Dillola Lord is third.</i>

990
01:24:36,702 --> 01:24:38,990
<i>Crown Jewel out now by an open length.</i>

991
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:42,033
<i>Sundown is moving on the outside very fast.</i>

992
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:45,374
<i>Now Sundown is up to her wheel.
It's still Crown Jewel.</i>

993
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,334
Come on, Sundown.

994
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:52,462
<i>...trotting as a pair,
it's Crown Jewel and Sundown.</i>

995
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:54,342
Come on, Sundown!

996
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:57,345
<i>Still trotting very fast on the outside now.</i>

997
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:58,676
Come on, Kenny.

998
01:24:58,765 --> 01:25:01,636
<i>It's Crown Jewel and Sundown
racing as a pair.</i>

999
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:04,052
<i>Crown Jewel pulls away a little bit...</i>

1000
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:05,177
Go on, Sundown!

1001
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:09,020
<i>Sundown is trying very hard
to improve his position here. Oh!</i>

1002
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,315
<i>Crown Jewel makes a break.</i>

1003
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:14,735
She's broken!

1004
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:19,865
<i>Sundown is trotting very fast on the outside.
Moving up slowly, he goes to the top.</i>

1005
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:24,414
<i>Crown Jewel is still on the rail. McLaughlin
finding it hard to get her on the stride.</i>

1006
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:29,952
<i>On the outside and going very fast...
Here he is - Sundown, the winner!</i>

1007
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:31,209
<i>(neighs)</i>

1008
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:35,212
It's... it's Grandpa! It's Grandpa! It's Grandpa!

1009
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:37,758
He's won! He's won! Oh, he's won!

1010
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:41,679
I'm sorry about Ken.

1011
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:45,100
Oh, he's won. Isn't that wonderful? Oh!

1012
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,856
Looks like we brought up the rear
that time, boy.

1013
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:50,857
Here is the winner
of the third heat and the race,

1014
01:25:50,943 --> 01:25:53,481
the Governor's Stake for 14-class trotters -

1015
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:57,615
Sundown, owned and driven
by Beaver Greenway.

1016
01:26:03,789 --> 01:26:07,656
- What happened to her, Ken?
- I don't know. She just quit.

1017
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:09,957
<i>(whinnies softly)</i>

1018
01:26:10,045 --> 01:26:12,251
Yeah.

1019
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:23,839
And it gives me great pleasure to welcome
Beaver Greenway back to the harness game

1020
01:26:23,934 --> 01:26:27,469
by awarding him the trophy
for having won the Governor's Stake.

1021
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:29,140
Thank you, sir.

<i>(band plays "The Camptown Races")</i>

1023
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:39,857
- Mr Greenway, what made Crown Jewel quit?
- Quit? A horse like her don't quit.

1024
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:43,782
- You won, Grandpa. You won. You won.
- I'll get a shot of that, please.

1025
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:46,741
Hop on, ducky. All right.

1026
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:05,724
- What happened to her, Rob?
- As far as I can see, there's nothing wrong.

1027
01:27:05,809 --> 01:27:09,677
She didn't stop going just to let me win.
You drove a great race, son.

1028
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:10,803
Thank you, sir.

1029
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:14,397
It wasn't your fault she didn't win.
You were as good as Grandpa.

1030
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:16,892
- Honest?
- Shh!

1031
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:25,908
<i>(laughs)</i>

1032
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:30,290
- What are you laughing at?
- Well, by ginger, I might have known it.

1033
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:34,159
- You're a great horseman, Rob, and you, Ken.
- What do you mean?

1034
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:38,833
This is one for the book. Unless I'm mistaken,
this young lady's going to be a mother.

Thunderhead.

1039

Of course. Listen, he's giving you
the horse laugh now.

1040
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:57,358
- A colt by Thunderhead.
- That's better than winning the race.

1041
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:02,322
He's Thunderhead all over.

1042
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:05,361
His eyes are
his great grandfather's - the Albino.

1043
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:09,580
- He's got something to live up to.
- He will. He'll be the greatest of them all.
