is 'cause you told us Laramie
was gonna be the hub.

What else you got, huh?
No bread. Nowhere to go.

359

No 40 acres and no mule.

360

All you got is this job. Huh?

McGinnes is our only connection to
the labor market in the northeast.

365

More Freedmen, then. Buy out the
bonds from the southern prisons.

We haven't kept up payment on
the Freedmen's bonds we have.

further business with us.

Ownership comes with responsibilities.

385
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:22,867
And what kinds of responsibilities?

386
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:25,937
Responsibilities suited to
a man of your background.

387
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,440
A man unafraid of back alleys.

388

them kinds of responsibilities.
