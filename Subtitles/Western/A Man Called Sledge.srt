1
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,018
Don't anybody move.

2
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,986
Back.

3
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,694
I'm gonna have to call you.

4
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,061
Looks okay.

5
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,001
My two pairs aren't good enough.
It's all yours.

6
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:39,647
Now I'm gonna try to get my money
back with a little five card draw.

7
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,888
What'll it be?

8
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,552
-Two bottles of whiskey.
-You must be staying for a while.

9
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,324
Well, long enough for him
to buy the second round.

10
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,897
-That'll be $ 10.
-Cowboy...

11
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,305
...you looking for something?

12
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,575
Oh, shut up, Liz.

13
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,040
Hey, I never did see what happened.

14
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,839
How did the driver
get his head blown off?

15
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,814
-Pure accident.
-They'll blame it on us.

16
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,586
I just hate to see a man
get it like that.

17
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,021
-No reason. No reason at all.
-Let's have another deck over here.

18
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,525
Yeah, might change my luck.

19
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,695
Ain't gonna help much.

20
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,959
Get another bottle of whiskey
over at that table.

21
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,363
Looks like a big game.

22
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,665
Big game.

23
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,042
I think I'll go over and take a look.

24
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,146
You never just look
and you never win.

25
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,112
You're the worst poker player
I ever saw, Mallory.

26
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,219
Well, not tonight, because tonight
I feel lucky. You'll see.

27
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,287
-Mind if I sit in?
-Sit down.

28
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,480
Yeah, sit down, stranger.

29
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:57,128
-May be just the man we're looking for.
-Come on, I feel real lucky tonight.

30
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,965
Sledge, you made it.

31
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,735
-Ria.
-Sledge.

32
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,493
I been waiting here so long.

33
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,689
I thought--

34
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,894
I thought you'd never show up.

35
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,463
Will three sixes do it?

36
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,042
Not unless you can pair them up
with a couple of ladies.

37
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,236
You gave me the jack I needed.
That makes three.

38
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,854
Well, that lets me out.

39
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,290
I'm out.

40
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:25,096
Elizabeth, how about you
and me going upstairs.

41
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,532
I just made a killing.

42
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,307
It came from downstairs.

43
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,517
Don't go down.

44
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,993
Sledge.

45
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,625
Hold it.

46
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:59,295
Now, you leave that gun in its holster
and come down here slow and easy.

47
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,937
Looks like the only way
he's gonna make it is to fall down.

48
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,323
Your friend had some bad luck.

49
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,828
Unless you want to join him,
you'll ride out of here right now.

50
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,997
You heard him, get.

51
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,576
Well, look at that.
Lover-boy ain't finished yet.

52
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,332
I seen it, mister...

53
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,505
...murder and self-defense.

54
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,348
Hey!

55
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,047
What--?

56
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,750
-No.
-Get inside.

57
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,588
Wait.

58
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,106
-Why are you following me?
-I wasn't. I swear I wasn't.

59
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,845
You know who I am, don't you?

60
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,908
There's only one name
comes to my mind...

61
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,447
...after what I saw
there at the 3 W's...

62
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,214
...and that's Luther Sledge.

63
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,414
And you say you wasn't following me?

64
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,785
I've done a lot of things
in my time, mister...

65
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,022
...but getting the price
on a man's head ain't one of them.

66
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,860
Well, we'll just make sure of that.

67
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,559
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

68
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:55,571
Old man, you stink right now...

69
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,006
...so I'm gonna see to it
that you don't turn me in.

70
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,511
I'm gonna hang you up
and age you some more.

71
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,707
You gotta believe me,
it's the gold I've been following...

72
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,445
...about $300,000 worth.

73
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,215
In that prison there
is where they keep it overnight.

74
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,024
Open the gates!

75
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,307
Open her up. Open her up.

76
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,812
-What's that about?
-It's the gold. They're here, I told you.

77
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,957
Now cut me down.
Come on, I gotta see it!

78
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,789
They're here. I gotta see it. l--

79
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,273
I missed it.

80
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,335
I missed it.

81
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,478
How much gold did you say
they carry in that wagon?

82
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:16,587
Enough for a man to die on,
more than that, maybe.

83
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,419
Old man, how long has it been
since you've had a hot meal...

84
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,031
...some whiskey and a woman?

85
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,100
All in one night?

86
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,467
Not for a long time.

87
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,439
Well, if your heart'll stand it,
you're coming with me.

88
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,183
Come on, girls, sing out.

89
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,600
-Get me out of here!
-Here, I'll give you a hand, Jade.

90
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,507
Can't even stand
on your own two feet.

91
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,872
Give me a hand, Millie.

92
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,178
Wait'll I get my hands
on whoever did that.

93
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,590
Sledge, Sledge, Sledge,
you're just in time to see...

94
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,954
...what these animals
have done to my house.

95
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,460
I can't take it anymore.
I just can't take it.

96
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,997
Oh, calm down now, Jade, honey.
What'd they do?

97
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,831
They made a hole in my floor
and my organ fell through.

98
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,769
-Your organ fell through?
-That's right.

99
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,038
Like animals. They burrow under
my house trying to steal my liquor.

100
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,305
You're gonna have to do something.

101
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,279
Don't you worry about it, Jade,
I'll take care of it.

102
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,249
Well, you're gonna
have to do something about it.

103
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:59,323
-Look. Look at that.
-Now, you just leave it to me.

104
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,560
Sledge, you see?

105
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,528
Well, you're right.
Your organ fell through.

106
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,998
All right, come on,
get that thing out of there.

107
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,807
Where's Mallory?

108
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,000
-Got killed in a card game.
-Was two of them...

109
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,579
...but Sledge killed them back,
both of them.

110
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,272
Who's he?

111
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,180
Don't know much about him,
but he may be able to help.

112
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:31,551
I'll let you know. Give me a bottle
of whiskey and two glasses...

113
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,182
...and get him whatever
kind of soup you got back there.

114
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,455
Come on, old man.

115
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,090
Come on, sit over there.

116
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,009
Tell me about the gold.

117
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,907
Well, I'm the one
that can tell you about it.

118
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,179
They put it next to me in that prison,
those men guarding it.

119
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:05,051
Not more than six inches away.
Cell right next to me.

120
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,057
Where does that gold start from?

121
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,890
<i>Comes from a group of mines
up there in Big Rock Canyon.</i>

122
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,467
<i>They take a lot of gold
out of there. A lot of gold.</i>

123
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,361
<i>They've got themselves
40 U.S. Army men...</i>

124
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,100
<i>...just to make sure that gold
gets to the clearing-house.</i>

125
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,245
<i>Forty soldiers, armed to the teeth.</i>

126
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,075
<i>They're all handpicked.</i>

127
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,109
<i>Those fellas guarding that gold...</i>

128
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:44,886
<i>...they don't like to travel at night.
It's too tempting for people like you.</i>

129
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,725
<i>At night they stop
in that prison you saw.</i>

130
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,735
<i>And that ain't just a prison,
it's a fortress.</i>

131
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,397
<i>It's the only place
where that damn gold is safe.</i>

132
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:01,945
<i>They got a real special cell for it,
with a big old safe built into it.</i>

133
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,878
<i>Nobody's ever tried taking it.</i>

134
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,484
<i>It's been 10 years now.</i>

135
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,952
<i>Them gold riders know their business.</i>

136
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,654
<i>You gotta be loco
if you think you can take it.</i>

137
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:19,196
What makes you think that shipment
they brought in was worth 300,000?

138
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,658
Well, nothing makes me think. I know.

139
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,537
I never could sleep
when that gold was next to me.

140
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,905
You know, gold gives off a scent.

141
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,414
It's like an animal or a man.

142
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,449
Paper money...

143
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,745
...don't throw off a scent.

144
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,624
Paper money don't whisper to you...

145
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,991
...like gold does
through six inches of steel.

146
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,395
Did you follow
that gold all the way?

147
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,625
From the mines to the clearing-house?

148
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,167
Yeah.

149
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,970
Hey, I reckon
you're gonna try and take it.

150
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,305
Who knows? Maybe you'll get a little
closer to that gold than just six inches.

151
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,416
-We're onto something.
-Yeah?

152
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,077
Make sure everybody's ready
to move out.

153
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,121
Right.

154
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,430
So you're gonna try and take it.

155
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:31,058
Well, you're mighty stubborn,
because you can't, you just can't.

156
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,836
Ward, Hooker.

157
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,045
-We're gonna split up here.
-Going into Rockville?

158
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:53,419
-No way out of it, we need supplies.
-It's a hard town. They know your face.

159
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,891
They won't see it
unless there's trouble.

160
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,064
-Hey, old man.
-Yeah?

161
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,403
-They know your face in Rockville?
-In prison, about 20 years' worth.

162
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,767
But not in the town.

163
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:13,168
Dorothy, Millie, stay on the buckboard.
Old man, Toby, Hooker...

164
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,007
...we're going into Rockville
to do some buying.

165
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,173
The rest of you follow Ward
up to the old Coaltrain Mine.

166
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,581
Beetle, you know where
the 3 W's is?

167
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,950
-Where you was with Mallory.
-There's a girl there named Ria.

168
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,718
You tell her I want her. Let's go.

169
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,529
Giddyup, there.

170
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:12,102
-Yeah, you gonna be finished soon?
-It's your turn next, okay?

171
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,751
What can I do for you, sir?

172
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,157
Well, Mother, I guess
we'll be gone for a long time.

173
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,959
Let me see, let me have
10 boxes of .45 Colt cartridges...

174
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,467
...and two boxes
of shotgun shells to go with it.

175
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,798
-And a case of Winchesters.
-A long time?

176
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,566
With all that ammo,
you could be gone forever.

177
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,673
Well, should we die before
our journey's through, happy days.

178
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,145
-All is well.
-Amen.

179
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,415
-Put that on the buckboard, please.
-Right.

180
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,453
-Let me on one more time.
-No.

181
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:33,242
-Business pretty good today, Simms?
-I'd say so now.

182
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,750
I feel like one of them
Eastern war profiteers.

183
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,687
-Oh, yeah, who's warring?
-Some old man in there.

184
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,624
Bought himself enough firepower
to save Custer.

185
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,832
Dolgh, come here.

186
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,691
Excuse me.
I'm the sheriff here in Rockville.

187
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,532
Sorry to bother,
but I'd like to ask a few questions.

188
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,401
Well, go right ahead, sheriff.

189
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,577
You been buying a lot of ammunition.
Could I ask you why?

190
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,043
Well, we got a family, sheriff,
big family going west...

191
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,977
...and them lndians had a dry year.

192
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,209
I don't wanna get caught short
with them being hungry.

193
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:44,253
-Ever been in Rockville before?
-No, sirree, sheriff.

194
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,118
Seems to me I've seen you before.

195
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,759
Would you mind
stepping outside for a moment?

196
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,693
If you can stand the sight of this
old-timer's face in the light of day...

197
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,992
...I'll gladly accommodate you.

198
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,128
You make one sound
and you'll be all over the ceiling.

199
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:04,673
And you, put your hands on the
counter and keep your mouth shut.

200
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:09,279
Old man.

201
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,945
His deputy is nosing around
that other store.

202
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,088
You go over and tell him
the sheriff wants to talk to him.

203
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:22,192
And the rest of you
get out of town, nice and easy.

204
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,352
You'll never make it
out the door, Sledge.

205
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,559
Yeah, you know me.

206
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,827
The name, the face
and the price, huh?

207
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,834
If I don't get out, you don't.

208
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,667
You ain't gonna get a chance
to sit around a stove...

209
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,707
...remembering your one day of glory.

210
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:43,377
That deputy of yours don't get
over here, your twilight years are over.

211
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,592
Easy, now.

212
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,532
-Boss, you want me?
-Yeah, Dolgh. Come on in.

213
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,398
It's Sledge, look out!

214
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,670
Get him. Get him.

215
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,148
Try anything else
and you'll have a closed coffin.

216
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,053
Cindy! Cindy!

217
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,994
Mommy!

218
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:40,435
We gotta get the hell out of here.
They're setting up a crossfire.

219
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,748
Toby's trying to make it back in.

220
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,824
Oh, how many times
they wanna kill him?

221
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,333
Tell those crazy bastards
he's already dead.

222
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,997
This is Ripley.

223
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,303
Hold your fire.

224
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,314
Hold your fire!

225
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,913
You tell them we're walking out.
All of us.

226
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,456
You two-bit Wyatt Earp, tell them.

227
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:41,031
Don't believe all that crap about
your tin star. You bleed just like we do.

228
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,026
We're coming out.

229
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,432
We got your sheriff.

230
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,540
Now, stay out of the streets.

231
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,775
Anybody sights a rifle,
fires a shot...

232
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,873
...you got yourselves a dead sheriff.

233
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:01,948
Hooker, see if you can coax
Goldie May over here.

234
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,815
Goldie May, here.

235
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,715
Come on, Goldie May.

236
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,525
Come on, baby, come on.

237
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,428
Come on, baby.

238
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,660
Come on, baby. Come on.

239
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,796
Come on, now. Come on.

240
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,260
Come on, come on, come on.

241
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,531
Easy, there. Come on, baby.

242
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,005
Easy. Come on.

243
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,473
Now, hold it.

244
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,082
Hooker.

245
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,813
Put him up on Goldie May with Toby.
Tie him good around him.

246
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,423
Where are you taking me?

247
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,823
I'm gonna let them Apaches
you use for trackers find you.

248
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,932
Ride him, Toby.
Ride him straight to hell!

249
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,065
We've been outnumbered before...

250
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,372
...and for a hell of a lot less money.

251
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:17,174
Must be some reason
nobody ever tried to take it.

252
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:27,353
What's the longest distance
you ever followed them?

253
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,618
After they leave prison,
about five miles.

254
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,989
Well, that ain't very far.

255
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,360
We're gonna follow that gold
every step of the way.

256
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,730
Somewhere there's gotta be a place
where we can take it.

257
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,564
That's what we're gonna look for.

258
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,730
I don't like the idea
of those guards being professionals.

259
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,399
Forget it.

260
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,241
They haven't used
those guns in 10 years.

261
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,747
They ain't professionals.

262
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,343
We are.

263
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:05,890
Stay here. I'm going down
to see how close I can get.

264
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,265
Rider coming.

265
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,333
Rider coming!

266
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,667
Seen a lot of formations in my time,
but never one like that cross.

267
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,968
The hell with it.
You couldn't take it with a pope.

268
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,880
Relax.

269
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,787
Don't you even know the sound
of Beetle slopping in the saddle?

270
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,948
It's Beetle, all right.
He's taking Ria up to your place.

271
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,718
What are we gonna do, Sledge?

272
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:55,564
You're gonna sit and wait
till I tell you what to do.

273
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,566
There's a way.
There's gotta be a way.

274
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,761
I'm getting itchy
staying around here.

275
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,931
That sheriff's gonna come smelling
us out and he won't take us alive.

276
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,441
We should've killed him
when we had the chance.

277
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,874
-Hooker?
-Yeah?

278
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,075
You and the boys go outside.
I wanna talk to Sledge.

279
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,482
That suits me just fine, especially
if you can find out what's going on.

280
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,336
We gotta move on to something else.

281
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,798
Got nothing in my pocket but a hole.

282
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,838
I want that gold!

283
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,639
Maybe $300,000!
300,000, Ward!

284
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:49,683
I ain't kidding myself it's the last one.

285
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:53,381
I'm gonna finish my life
with a white picket fence...

286
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,356
...and the little woman
making biscuits.

287
00:34:56,527 --> 00:35:00,623
Me sprouting gray
like a tree in the fall.

288
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,494
I'm gonna get it
with a bullet in my head.

289
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:07,604
Or a rope around my neck. I want
a little taste of living before I go.

290
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,299
You try to take that gold,
you're committing suicide.

291
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,444
You thinking of riding, Ward?

292
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,774
Yeah, in the morning.

293
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,714
Had a lot of good times together.

294
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,421
Yeah.

295
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,286
What about the others?

296
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,092
They'll stay with you if you want them.

297
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,832
I'd damn sure watch them,
they're getting hungry.

298
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,784
Ria?

299
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,295
-Ria?
-I'm up here.

300
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,791
You been crying?

301
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,240
I don't even remember
the last time a woman cried over me.

302
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,844
Most times I don't even remember
their faces in the morning.

303
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:30,611
Nobody meant much to me before.
Before you.

304
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,613
But you want that gold
more than you want me.

305
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,555
That's why I've been crying, Sledge.

306
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,659
You know, you were the first.

307
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,895
The first time I felt anything.

308
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:49,301
Used to think there was something
wrong with me until you came along.

309
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,713
I'm your woman, Sledge,
no matter what happens.

310
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,352
I'll always be yours.

311
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,819
I love you.

312
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,708
Keep it going, there.

313
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,713
Come on now, old man.

314
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,478
You watch it, old fool.

315
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,419
Get him, old man!

316
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,588
I feel like dancing!

317
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,504
What's all the commotion?

318
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,040
It's the old man.
He was inside with Dorothy.

319
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,043
You boys should have seen me
in my prime.

320
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,209
They don't make them
like me anymore.

321
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:09,046
Why, there was a time I could
have taken you all on, all of you!

322
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,486
-Just when the hell was that, old man?
-Before they locked me in that prison.

323
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,991
There wasn't a man that could lock
horns with me in this territory.

324
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,890
You're a liar.

325
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,794
You was as good as you say you were,
you'd be six feet under.

326
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:29,468
You're feeling mean, because
you know that gold can't be taken...

327
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,302
...and you've seen it yourself.
And I tell you...

328
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,572
...if you try to take it you're gonna
wind up dead or in prison...

329
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:41,184
...and that's the closest you'll ever
get to it, through six inches of steel.

330
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:45,652
I know. I've been
closer to that gold inside...

331
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,484
...than any man on the outside...

332
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,957
...and I tell you,
it can't be taken.

333
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,527
Oh, yes, it can!

334
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,830
I knew it! I knew it all the time.

335
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,167
We're gonna take that gold,
and we're gonna take all of it.

336
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,175
And you and your tales of old-timers
don't mean a whiff of cow dung...

337
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,575
...because you never had
the guts to do it.

338
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,409
-We're gonna take it from the inside.
-The inside?

339
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,982
Right.

340
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,314
Now, tell me the layout.
And you better have a good memory...

341
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,854
...or I'm gonna bust you
like I did that bottle.

342
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,652
Well, I told you.
They put the gold in a vault.

343
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,354
Used to be like all the other cells,
but they lined it with steel...

344
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,964
...and it's in the hole,
in maximum security.

345
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,931
And you say they open and close it
with a combination?

346
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,731
Right. And the only one
that knows it is the warden.

347
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,737
How many men
they got in that prison?

348
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,308
I don't know, about 500,
give or take a few.

349
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,572
Now, you think real hard
before you answer this.

350
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,315
If they was to take me prisoner...

351
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,343
...where do you figure they'd put me?

352
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:54,582
With the price on your head,
I figure it would be maximum security.

353
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,284
They put you in there,
you ain't ever gonna get out.

354
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,328
Oh, I might. I just might...

355
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,988
...if you was to take me in.

356
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,298
<i>If I took you?
What's the matter, you loco?</i>

357
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,372
-Oh, you two can't take it alone.
-We ain't alone!

358
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,408
We outnumber them.
You heard what the old man said.

359
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,068
They got 500 prisoners in there.

360
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,009
Well, we're gonna bust them out.

361
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:24,086
And all those guards
and the fancy gold riders...

362
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,190
...they ain't gonna know what hit them.

363
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,588
They're gonna be chasing prisoners...

364
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,228
-...all over the territory.
-Sledge.

365
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,159
They're stacked against us.

366
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,101
Now, we're going in there...

367
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,127
...and we're coming out
with that gold...

368
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,102
...or we ain't ever coming out.

369
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,103
Now, what do you say?

370
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,478
-I'm in.
-Right.

371
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,852
Hey, old man. Now, you go in there
and you get some paper...

372
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:05,621
...and you're gonna draw a diagram
of that prison and I'll look at it.

373
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,892
And if it ain't exact,
somebody's gonna put a bullet...

374
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,501
...right through your head.
Now, get!

375
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,964
Beetle, saddle up again.

376
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,905
You're going after a few things
we need. And from now on...

377
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,772
...no more whiskey.

378
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,241
Ria?

379
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,757
We'll be moving out in the morning.

380
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,519
Things work out, we'll be
across the border in Siego.

381
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,492
-You know where that is?
-Yes.

382
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,790
Well, good. You wait for me there.

383
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,526
And what if things don't work out?

384
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,775
Then I won't be there.

385
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,113
-Hooker?
-Yeah?

386
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,718
You got everything?

387
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,548
Yeah.

388
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,458
All right, see you inside.

389
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,504
-What is it you want?
-I wanna see the warden.

390
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:04,080
-What's your business?
-I'm a U.S. marshal. Got a prisoner.

391
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,148
Can't be one of ours.

392
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,615
Take him to town, sheriff's office.

393
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,414
You tell him I got Luther Sledge!

394
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:19,388
Call the warden. Tell him they got
Luther Sledge out here.

395
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:23,260
-Seems as though they heard of you.
-Tell the sheriff!

396
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,314
Follow me.

397
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,935
Careful!

398
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,565
Now, hold him there.

399
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,325
It's up this way.

400
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,506
-You send for the sheriff?
-Sure did.

401
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,571
Bring him in.

402
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:58,326
Come over here, Luther Sledge.

403
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,296
-Where did you get him?
-Oh, I picked him up...

404
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:09,064
...about halfway between here and
3 W's. Started tracking him there.

405
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,764
What did you bring him here for?

406
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,400
I don't like traveling
a prisoner like him all night.

407
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,980
Getting tired, thought maybe
you might lock us up till morning.

408
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,880
Sheriff Ripley might have something
to say about that.

409
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,280
Sledge here killed one of his deputies.

410
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,258
How much money
you worth now, Sledge?

411
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,826
Why don't you ask him.

412
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,326
He's the one that's gonna collect it.

413
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,565
Last time I saw it was 5000,
warm or cold.

414
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,730
Five thousand.

415
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,168
What did you say your name was?

416
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,470
Well, I don't think I did.

417
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,747
It's Ward...

418
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,905
...Marshal lrwin Ward.

419
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,413
You ready to lock us up, warden?

420
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:05,525
I don't know. Seems to me the sheriff
might have that jurisdiction.

421
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,922
What are you talking about?

422
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,601
I never kept
overnight prisoners before.

423
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,764
I only get them
after the court's through with them.

424
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,507
I was hoping I'd run into you again.

425
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,375
I'd like to even things up.

426
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,716
What are you doing?
He's in my custody.

427
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,223
-I don't want nothing to happen to him.
-I don't care whose custody.

428
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:39,726
-He killed my deputy. He's gonna pay.
-Not by you, he ain't.

429
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,661
No one's trying to cheat you
out of the reward money.

430
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:46,234
I ain't gonna argue. He's in my
custody and he's gonna stay there.

431
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,338
If you wanna be locked up with him...

432
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:53,203
...there's no reason the sheriff
can't do it for you in Rockville.

433
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,403
Not only that, marshal...

434
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,242
...I'll get a posse to ride with you
to the county seat.

435
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,987
-Even go with you myself.
-That sounds like a fair thing to do.

436
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,590
Sheriff, you lay off him tonight.

437
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,693
That's all the marshal here
is worried about.

438
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,328
You're staying with me tonight.

439
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,833
Well, that's just fine.

440
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,574
I hear you're good in bed.

441
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,813
Ripley!

442
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,244
I'll keep him here, Ripley.

443
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,049
Be here in the morning
with your posse.

444
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,183
That's soon enough.

445
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,692
I'll be back at dawn.

446
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,764
Leave your weapons here.

447
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,447
Better leave the key to his chains.

448
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,648
Red, take them to maximum security.

449
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,619
Yes, sir.

450
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,457
How come you
staying with us, marshal?

451
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,566
Don't you trust us?

452
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,293
No.

453
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,634
By tomorrow morning
you'll wish you had.

454
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:19,213
-I've been in prisons before.
-Not like this one, you ain't.

455
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,045
No, sir. You ain't gonna like it.

456
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,853
I'll worry about that.

457
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,957
Wait and see what we have
in our maximum.

458
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:04,118
Hey, Sledge, you come
to rob the gold?

459
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,959
Do not sleep there, Sledge.

460
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,688
Didn't count on him roughing you up.
You gonna be all right?

461
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,828
-Yeah, yeah.
-You sure?

462
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:42,761
He got in a couple of pretty good
whacks on me.

463
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,429
We're in, Ward.

464
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,230
We are in.

465
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,411
There it is...

466
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,344
...just like the old
man said it would be.

467
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,450
Talk about safes.

468
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,677
That's the granddaddy of them all.

469
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,951
Yeah.

470
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,751
It's gonna start getting light soon.

471
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,457
We'd better get started.

472
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,571
Careful, that sheriff kicks like a mule.

473
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:43,520
Going crazy here.
I'm going crazy here!

474
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:47,629
-Call the guard!
-Shut up, you crazy bastard!

475
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,658
If they don't shut up,
they'll bring the guards in.

476
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,324
All right, get with it, Ward.

477
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,935
Easy. Don't break it.

478
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,014
It's stuck.

479
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,016
Hey, marshal.

480
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:14,089
When you finish holding his hand,
come on over to hold mine.

481
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:15,849
Wiseass.

482
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,995
If we get out of here,
I'm gonna put a bullet in him.

483
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:23,692
Shut up, damn it! Shut up!

484
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,768
Guard! Guard!

485
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,705
Come on, Ward, get it.

486
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,935
Try the right cuff.

487
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,475
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

488
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,049
Shut the hell up, all of you!

489
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,994
Well, well, well.

490
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,826
Can't figure you out.

491
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:00,668
Ain't nobody being hanged out there.

492
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,472
Ain't even a full moon tonight.

493
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:12,411
Now, if that don't shut you up...

494
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,415
...I'll be forced to lay one
on your head.

495
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,843
That's better.

496
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,285
How's he doing, marshal?

497
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,516
Is he behaving himself?

498
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:26,128
Well, I think when you
busted his hand...

499
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,060
...you busted his bladder.

500
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,400
Well, come morning,
when the sheriff takes custody...

501
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,039
...you better get
a storeful of slop buckets...

502
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,142
...because he's really gonna need it.

503
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,707
Because Ripley's
gonna be your judge...

504
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:50,148
...jury and executioner.

505
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,050
Hey, they got Red.

506
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,414
He got Red. He got Red.

507
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,125
Hey, hey, Sledge, get us out of here!

508
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,890
-Get us all out of here.
-Hurry up with those keys.

509
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,862
Come on.

510
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,093
What's the matter?

511
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:11,004
-Damn. They don't fit, Sledge.
-Sledge!

512
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,732
-He don't have the cell keys.
-Who's got them?

513
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,707
Mac. He's in the tunnel.

514
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,708
-Mac's coming.
-Forget it, Ward.

515
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,714
Get him on his feet.

516
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,624
Turn him around.

517
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:44,831
Hey, Red, how many times I gotta tell
you to keep that block door closed?

518
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:55,441
Hey, Red, I'm talking to you.

519
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,592
All right, hold it! Hold it!

520
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,738
You try to get loose
and I'll break your neck.

521
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,839
All right, get his keys.

522
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:23,972
I can't make it, Sledge.
He's liable to break free.

523
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,810
Pass him down from cell to cell
so I can get this gun on him.

524
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,266
I'll kill you, you old bastard.

525
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:50,896
I'll kill you.

526
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,237
I'll kill you.

527
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:58,876
I'll kill you.

528
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,618
All right, that's enough.

529
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:08,480
Now, take your keys out
and throw them over here.

530
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,996
Damn it, the keys.

531
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,196
I said throw them over here.

532
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,637
Let's get the hell out of here.

533
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,969
Let me out!

534
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,577
Hey, open her up!

535
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:05,942
I'll let these out first,
then open the other cells. Shut up!

536
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:09,346
Shut up and listen! There's only
one way to get out of here.

537
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,682
That's to take the guards
and bust every cell open.

538
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,723
If you don't,
you can stay here and rot...

539
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:19,055
...or wait till they hang you.
Now, what do you want?

540
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,061
Start them.

541
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:46,653
Open it up, I'm in for a hanging.

542
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,590
When that black hood comes over
your face, you think of me.

543
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,628
Get them out.

544
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,421
What about the wolf?

545
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:59,125
You might as well turn him out,
they're gonna kill him anyway.

546
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,361
Come on, Ward!

547
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,907
Let's open up them other cell blocks.
Come on.

548
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,004
Let me out!

549
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:15,047
Let me out!

550
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,514
Let me out!

551
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,245
Let me out!

552
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,798
Get back!

553
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,935
Come on, get back!

554
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,602
Okay. Okay.

555
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,143
Make sure those cell blocks
are open, Ward.

556
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,008
Right!

557
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,150
Take these shells.

558
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,885
Let me get this.

559
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,478
Don't kill him, I need him.

560
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,647
The combination, what is it?

561
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,318
The combination, what is it?

562
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:11,115
Come on!
They're breaking out of the prison.

563
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,777
Beetle, watch that tunnel.

564
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,385
-Where's the warden?
-They killed him.

565
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:47,785
What do we do now? Them
gold riders will be coming in here.

566
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:51,222
-They must have heard the shots.
-Joyce and Guthrie will hold them.

567
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:54,261
Hooker, put the old man in the cell.

568
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,864
-Please, don't put me in there.
-Get in there.

569
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,367
-Sledge, I can't stay in here.
-You hear me good, old man.

570
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,301
You said you heard that combination.
You can remember.

571
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:08,239
-I can't remember. Please let me out.
-You sold me on this claim...

572
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,005
...and you'll pay off
or I'm gonna leave you in here.

573
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,075
Bice, turn that tumbler.

574
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:23,017
Shut up, old man, and listen!

575
01:04:57,426 --> 01:05:00,589
-That's one.
-Turn another.

576
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,503
Come on. Come on. Slow.

577
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,270
Come on, Bice.

578
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,017
Another one.

579
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,083
The next one.

580
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,120
Right.

581
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:38,864
Slow. Easy. Easy.

582
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,002
That's it.

583
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:44,138
-Turn the handle!
-Turn the handle.

584
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:59,051
-They're riding in. I can hear them.
-Come on, Sledge.

585
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:06,184
You're gonna have a long time
to remember, old man. Let's go!

586
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,796
Sledge! Sledge!

587
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:10,527
Sledge, wait a minute!

588
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,600
I remember.

589
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,300
I remember they turned it twice.

590
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,870
Come on, Sledge, forget it.

591
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,529
Look, now try it!

592
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:56,667
-I told you.
-Sledge!

593
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,177
We gotta get out of here.

594
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,177
Here we go.

595
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,334
All right, let's go. Come on.

596
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,825
Sledge!

597
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:38,262
We'll rest the horses here.

598
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:44,112
Put the bags on the ground here.

599
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,568
Divide the rest.

600
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,543
How much you figure each of us got?

601
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,143
I don't know.

602
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,441
But I can remember
when we never dreamed...

603
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,141
...of splitting this much up
among the bunch of us.

604
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:27,517
Well, that ain't exactly a split, sonny.
Sledge got double.

605
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,292
Wanna play a few hands?

606
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:42,128
You trying to get some of my gold?

607
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,481
Joyce.

608
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,152
The man cheated me.

609
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,594
You didn't have to kill him.
I'd have made up his gold.

610
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,791
Stand up, you murdering
son of a bitch.

611
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,993
Guthrie. Now, Joyce was cheating.

612
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,971
He didn't have to die for it.
That was the old man's right.

613
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:07,836
I won't side with you.

614
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,774
You could have had my life
any time you wanted it.

615
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:13,779
I would have died for you, Sledge.
I would have.

616
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,883
He killed Joyce
and you say he's right?

617
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,676
His life wasn't his anymore.

618
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,555
It belonged to the man
who caught him cheating...

619
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:24,453
...and if you don't know that,
you better learn it.

620
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:29,958
-Come on, I'll help you bury him.
-You bury him, Sledge!

621
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,498
That old man
that none of us ever knew...

622
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:36,035
...took Joyce's life.
And he took you too.

623
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,400
So you bury him.

624
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:49,214
Hate don't belong in a card game,
but, old man...

625
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:53,478
...I'm gonna take every grain of gold
you got in front of you.

626
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,121
This game is over.

627
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,515
You just gonna go?

628
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:34,952
What about us, Sledge?
You just gonna leave us?

629
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,192
There's a cupful of gold left up there.

630
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,085
Split it up any way you want.

631
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,325
Couldn't you give us some more?

632
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:45,022
He ain't gonna give you
any of his gold.

633
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,634
He'd just as soon
leave you here to die.

634
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,328
You're dead already, old man.

635
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,167
Your life's in those sacks
and I'm taking them.

636
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,800
For the rest of your miserable life
you'll never forget it.

637
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:01,279
So you take your share out of that cup.

638
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,027
It ain't no share.

639
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:18,533
It ain't nothing.

640
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:22,759
And it ain't gonna keep us
from getting what's ours.

641
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,771
We're going after Ria.

642
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,643
Sledge!

643
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,481
Sledge!

644
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,349
We know you're here!

645
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,389
We thought we'd set up
a little deal with you.

646
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:05,264
You give us half of what you took us
for at poker and we'll call it even.

647
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,765
What do you say?

648
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,512
Old man!

649
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:29,810
Old man! I got Kehoe!

650
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,381
-Did you hear me?
-Kehoe.

651
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,785
If you want that gold,
you'll have to come and get it!

652
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:38,892
Hooker! Did you hear that?

653
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,960
Kehoe, he got him.

654
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,619
The odds are getting shorter.

655
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:45,960
-And our shares are getting bigger.
-We don't know where he is.

656
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,830
We don't have to know.
He's coming to us.

657
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,798
You just keep that carbine ready.

658
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:56,643
How long we gonna wait?
The people will be coming back soon.

659
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:59,075
Well, the waiting's over.

660
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,606
Sledge!

661
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:05,812
We got Ria!

662
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,421
And the deal's changed.

663
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:18,564
All the gold
or she's gonna join Kehoe.

664
01:22:21,369 --> 01:22:24,805
You're bluffing. Let me hear her.

665
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:39,846
-Call out to him!
-You'll kill him anyway.

666
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,613
I'll never help you.

667
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,054
You don't and I'll turn Bice
loose on you.

668
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,193
Just make her call out, nothing else.

669
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:48,852
Sure, Hooker, don't worry.

670
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:51,931
Being in here does funny things
to some people.

671
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,466
Come on, I haven't got all day!

672
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:59,596
Sledge sure knows how to pick them.

673
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:08,639
Sledge!

674
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:13,816
There's a fountain in the square.
Bring all the gold there, and now.

675
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:16,720
You hear me, Sledge?

676
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:20,258
You wanna save her,
you bring the gold to the square.

677
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,194
Ria! Ria!

678
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,527
She's all right, Sledge.

679
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:34,002
You just bring that gold to the fountain
and we'll turn her loose.

680
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:37,377
After this, I'm not asking no more.

681
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:47,045
It's coming down!

682
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:50,214
We done it. We done it!

683
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,793
Bice, once we get that gold,
I'm gonna kill you.

684
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:57,830
It's coming. It's coming.
Bice, you get up there and fire at him.

685
01:23:57,999 --> 01:23:59,933
Hooker, let's go.

686
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:13,138
Damn it, the gold. Get the horses!

687
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:13,056
It's all the old man's fault.

688
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,031
-We didn't need the gold...
-Ria.

689
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,568
...to be happy.

690
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:31,541
Bice.

691
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:35,617
Bice.

692
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,796
-He got Bice.
-Maybe the other way around.

693
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:55,568
No, you'd hear Bice yelling it
at the top of his lungs if it was.

694
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,040
We got all the gold!

695
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,806
How do you figure we'll keep it
with Sledge alive?

696
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:03,116
-We're gonna have to take him!
-All right.

697
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:07,285
I'll work back up the same way.
Just be sure you come behind him.

698
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,821
You can't travel very fast
with that gold...

699
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,388
...so you just remember
you got a partner.

700
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,585
Well, just one partner suits me fine.

701
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,030
Come on.

702
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:01,899
Old man, get ready!

703
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,299
Just you and me now!

704
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:06,064
Hooker?

705
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:13,274
Hooker?

706
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,467
The gold...

707
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:42,404
...I hid it.

708
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,206
You kill me, you'll never find it.

709
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,586
<i>We didn't need the gold to be happy.</i>

710
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:10,362
Hurts.

711
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,077
My claim is yours now.

712
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,810
I will it to you.

713
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,352
You'll never find the gold.

714
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,584
It's nothing but a dream.

715
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,794
Nothing but a dream.

716
01:31:50,395 --> 01:31:52,895
Vtg
