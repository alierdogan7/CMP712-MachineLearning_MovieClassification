00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:19,376
By 1860 Japan had already opened
her doors to the rest of the world

2
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:25,358
and the first ambassador to
Washington had arrived only after
alongand perilous voyage by sea.

3
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:29,553
Ten years later, despite the new
railroad from San Francisco,

4
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:32,190
Ambassador Sakaguchi, Lord of Bizen
was to find that besides the peril
of the voyage by sea,

5
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:36,794
there were further danger to
be faced on land, on theirway
through the West.

6
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:43,074

Why all the soldiers, Sargent?

About as expected.

87
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,350
Four hundred thousand?

Like we said in San Lucas.

93
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,593
Why not now, then we can separate.

94
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:12,866
Hunt, you've been shaking
like a tree full of owls
right from the start.

95
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:13,834
What the hell's the matterwith you?

96
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:15,397

00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:20,876
Well look, Hunt, no worry,
you'll get your cut

100
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:22,210
lt ain't him l'm worried about.

101

Gauche, make sure everything's
all right outside.

104
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,660
Anything you say, General.

What about him?

108
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:50,040

109
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:53,935
That's your split, take it and go.

110
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,244
Please Link, don't get sore.

111

Well, l sure as hell don't speak Japanese.

118
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,992

Well, if you want them to remain
in your service,

130
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:38,272
better tell them just to keep
their hands off those long knives.

131
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,685
Well now, Ambassador, tell you
how this works.

132
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:46,250
You're being a foreigner in a strange
land, me and my partner here,

133
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:49,527
we look around, take what we want.

136
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:46,215
Ambassador, you're a gentleman,

What do l do with these two?

138
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:55,857
Well, unless you have some
special use for men dressed
up like women, let them go.

139
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:57,857
All right.

140
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:14,040
Sir, it's a gift for the President
from my lmperial Majesty the Mikado.

141
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:02,457
Oh, gold, real gold, huh?

142
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:13,063
You tell your emperor, l thank him.

143
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:54,710
Jump.

144
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:56,380

You.

147
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:40,749
Are you shouting at me?

148
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,693
l want to know your name.

149
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,495
You're lucky l don't shoot you.

150
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,089
l ask for your name.

151
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:53,029
ln New Orleans l've shot men who
didn'tlike the cards l dealt them.

152
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,169
So why? l'll tell you my name,
what good is it to you?

153
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:05,047
l intend to find you, l intend to
see you dead.

154
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:11,113
l get impression that until today
you've never seen a man
killed by one of these.

155
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:16,890
Gun Sword, we all die the same way.

156
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:37,342
The name is Gauche.

157
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:37,903
They were like brothers.

158
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:39,669
That's too bad.

159
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:43,307
The man who killed him,
also tried to kill you.

160
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,716
Yeah, so it seems.

161
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:50,420
He stole from us Something
very precious.

162
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:54,515
A gift to your President
from my lmperial Majesty.

163
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:55,619
Too bad.

164
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,095
lt is a matter of honor
that it be returned to us.

165
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:00,858
You will lead my Samurai to that man.

166
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,868
Nope You'll want to kill Gauche on sight,

167
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:07,834
but l want that damned Frenchman alive.

168
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:10,802
Atleast until l get my hands on that money.

169
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,210
That will be between you and my Samurai
You will leave immediately.

170
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:18,341
l guess you didn't hear me, Ambassador.

171
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:21,182
l'm not dragging some greenhorn
around the countryside.

172
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:24,981
Make no mistake, Karoda
is no ordinary man.

173
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:29,952
l don't care what he is Look,
Ambassador, we don't have horses,

174
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:33,089
and Gauche has a two hour head
start and he's got 20 mean guns to back him up.

175
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:35,327
Hell, even if l do catch up with
him, the trouble just...

176
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:41,667
Silence Each of these dots
represent a day.

177
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,904
l have given him seven days
to recover the Mikado sword.

178
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:51,711
ln seven days, l will pass here again,
the same train.

179
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:55,112
Suppose he doesn't make it in seven days.

180
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:59,454
For the disgrace of failure,
he will rip his abdomen, kill himself.

181
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:03,952
So will l We call it, hari Kiri.

182
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,488
Well, that's something l'd like to see.

183
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:10,258
And he might as well do it now,
cause l'm not taking him.

184
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,930
Then, he will cut your head off.

185
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:17,709
That's something l wouldn'tlike to see.

186
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:08,491
Just testing, yes sir.

187
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,661
Just what l had in mind.

188
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:18,428
You get around pretty good in those skirts

189
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:23,966
Yes sir, l'm going to have
to try something else.

190
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,845
Wait a minute, now wait a minute.

191
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:41,587
These tracks are going
right around thatlong bend.

192
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,894
There's no otherway out of this canyon,
so we can save time by going right over the top.

193
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,361
Ah, what the hell, just follow me, huh?

194
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:11,488
Hell, let's rest, huh?

195
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:29,365
l think l got it all figured.

196
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:37,907
You see, ah you're a gorilla,
and you're as ugly as a buzzard.

197
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:44,412
Not only that, l think you're as
dumb as a backward jackass.

198
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:52,086
Who is more dumb? Me or the man who
let's himself get cheated by friends?

199
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,030
l thought you didn't know the language.

200
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,090
Did l say that?

201
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:56,998
No, but you never talked.

202
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:00,600
The jackass has nothing to say.

203
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:04,103
Well l think l like it better the otherway.

204
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:09,476
Move.

205
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:48,877
Hurry up.

206
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:32,994
Like l told you There they are.

207
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,233
Hell, don't you ever eat?

208
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:42,171
With the stomach empty,
it would be a disgrace to ...hunger.

209
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:48,604
For you maybe, yes Not me,
l'm a pampered Westerner.

210
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:51,842
All right We camp here.

211
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,047
There.

212
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:08,695
Ah Well now, the way l see it,
you're a man of honor And so am l.

213
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:12,864
Well, anyhow, let's make a deal.

214
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:21,201
l promise l won't try to ah, escape,

215
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:24,608
and l'll cooperate all the way
in tracking down Gauche.

216
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:29,552
And all l want from you, you see is
yourword that you won't kill him on sight.

217
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:34,382
Oause l figure l need atleast a
whole day to make him talk.

218
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,790
You will not escape.

219
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:40,662
Huh, don't you bet on that
You got to sleep sometime.

220
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,166
l already did.

221
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:44,927
Yeah, when?

222
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,164
While walking.

223
00:28:47,773 --> 00:28:50,867
l don't believe that But you know,

224
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:53,639
all l have to do is waltz you
around for about seven days,

225
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:55,475
at which time you'll belly stick yourself.

226
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:59,382
Yes After doing the same for you.

227
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:01,409
Ah, l can believe that, too.

228
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:04,854
Give me those.

229
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:06,618
What?

230
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:08,148
The boots.

231
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:30,007
Ah Oh wheeoo, that, that stinks
Expect me to eat this?

232
00:29:57,275 --> 00:30:00,802
Tastes not so bad, pretty good.

233
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:36,280
God damned mosquitoes, l can't sleep.

234
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:38,282
There's mosquitoes all over
the God damned place.

235
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:47,350
Wrong, one mosquito.

236
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,466
No mosquito.

237
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,682
Oome on, hurry.

238
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:50,852
They cross down there And there
as well Many houses.

239
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,487
Means l'm not going to San Lucas.

240
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:55,891
We cross here, too.

241
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,690
Down there?

242
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:58,889
Uh huh.

243
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:03,965
Uh, it's your idea, so you go first.

244
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:13,501
l had a dog, his name was green,

245
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:18,682
never said much, but he was mighty keen.

246
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,342
Shared my work and he sh....

247
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:19,935
Son of a bitch.

248
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:28,119
Damn.

249
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:32,352
Some day l'm going to catch you
without all that hardware.

250
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,690
Some day, you won't need to belly
stick yourself, l'll catch you.

251
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:56,611
Well My luck's changing.

252
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,019
Make a fist.

253
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:07,184
Oan't you even make a fist?

254
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:17,768
Hell, you think l'm going to hit a
man who can't even make a fist?

255
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,006
You think you can do that again?

256
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,069
Oh, most certainly.

257
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:04,842
Looks to me like you're getting tired.

258
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:12,352
l'll tell you what, we'll call it a draw.

259
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:20,688
Beautiful.

260
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:22,518
Beautiful?

261
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:24,519
The horses.

262
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:26,755
Ah, yes.

263
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,052
Yah, yah, toro, toro.

264
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:34,859
Five, six, seven Gauche must have
paid them off and gone alone.

265
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:48,377
What does he say?

266
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,973
He wants the old man to tell him
where he's hidden his daughters.

267
00:37:54,218 --> 00:37:55,276
He's not telling.

268
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,184
Brave man.

269
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:01,223
Stupid man.

270
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:09,466
Oome on, let's get ourselves some horses.

271
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,633
Wait Wait.

272
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:12,546
Now we're even Only l'm a
little even more even than you.

273
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:51,958
All right now, this is a horse
This is the front, this is the back.

274
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:56,493
And this is where you sit,
if you want to go this way,
you pull that way,

275
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:59,367
if you want to go that way you pull that way,
if you want to go straight ahead,

276
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:01,963
you kick the horse and hang on All right?

277
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:03,767
Thank you.

278
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:24,357
Horse not so good, l see you took
the best one for yourself.

279
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:37,198
Wait.

280
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:47,209
Hey you Here.

281
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:56,684
Now where?

282
00:41:57,228 --> 00:42:00,061
l go this way, you got a choice
of three other directions.

283
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:01,189
l go with you.

284
00:42:03,935 --> 00:42:08,838
Not any more you don't, l'm equipt.

285
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:12,138
l cannot find the man alone
l must succeed.

286
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,141
Karoda, that's your problem.

287
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:18,915
l'm concerned about a fortune,
that money is mine, l stole it.

288
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,647
The money means nothing
This is life and death.

289
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:26,686
Well, it seems like the only thing
we have in common is Gauche.

290
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:33,862
But l'll bargain with you
You give me yourword you let
him live until l find the gold.

291
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,058
You can trail along.

292
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,466
No, he killed the Namaro, he dies
the first minute l see him.

293
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,696
You can suite yourself.

294
00:45:44,622 --> 00:45:46,317
Yourword you let Gauche live.

295
00:45:46,357 --> 00:45:47,255
No.

296
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:52,962
All right, l'm going to drown you,
you stubborn mule, l'll hold
you under until you bust.

297
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:55,089
Yourword.

298
00:45:57,968 --> 00:45:59,936
All right you, pest.

299
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:19,019
Oh, hell.

300
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:34,861
Well, if nothing else, l got myself a bath.

301
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:40,509
You sure are one unreasonable man.

302
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:45,215
All this hassle over a hunk of metal.

303
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:50,919
Hell, you know when l catch up with Gauche,

304
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:57,084
l could buy you another sword,
l can buy you fifty swords.

305
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:07,928
Samurai knife is service, Kodo Bushido
says, be strong, have courage,

306
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:14,267
sacrifice yourself for your master
My fatherwas a Samurai.

307
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:23,413
His father, his, his, his Four
hundred years, all died fighting.

308
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:27,552
There is great honor in my family.

309
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:34,660
Yeah well, these days, alot of
people have peculiar ideas.

310
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:37,196
There's no need to strain yourself.

311
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:39,634
Men needs ideals to live by.

312
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,968
You can't spend ideals.

313
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:48,234
But now, all is changed.

314
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:56,342
Japan has big wars, big Lords,
has become different country.

315
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:00,156
Soon a great nation like yours,

316
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:05,987
then Samurai life will finish.

317
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:14,499
All must give up swords Become
farmers, fisherman, become nothing,

318
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:21,575
so l must succeed One last time,
my master service.

319
00:48:24,715 --> 00:48:26,615
Well, it just might be.

320
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:34,849
You understand, if l see you're going
to kill Gauche, l've just got to kill you.

321
00:48:35,893 --> 00:48:38,293
l understand you must try.

322
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:16,726
Alot of Gauche's men here, but no Gauche.

323
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:22,064
Well, this does it.

324
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:25,098
l'm not going to keep chasing
tracks with the Oommanche's on the prowl.

325
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:26,736
Oommanches?

326
00:49:26,777 --> 00:49:28,039
Yeah.

327
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:32,175
Where are we going?

328
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,444
We're going to San Lucas.

329
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:35,877
But you said they would not go there.

330
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:39,013
Well, l figure Gauche will
show up there sooner orlater.

331
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:39,920
Why?

332
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:43,352
For the best of reasons,
her name is Ohristina.

333
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:36,110
We'll wait alittle.

334
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:36,942
Uh huh.

335
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:47,152

336
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:48,351
Yeah.

And when is that?

00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,473
When he feels like it.

Oh, that shouldn't be too long
then, should it?

407

lf you want to know, it's been
ten days Along time for a man.

408
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:55,330
Ohristina, because of my fond
memories of you, and because

00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:58,399
l know you have a fine practical sense,
l'll bargain with you.

410
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:03,431
You help me find where Gauche hid the
friends of this big golden eagle,

411
00:56:04,307 --> 00:56:06,502
and l'll see that you get a hefty share.

412
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,709
l don't know what you're talking about.

413
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:13,308
My mistake.

414
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:16,246
And you make plenty of them.

415
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:19,119

00:56:52,656 --> 00:57:02,588
Oh Oh, l'll get you Stop it,

420
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,461
Then we left the trail and
came straight on here.

421
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:10,029
l figured Gauche would show
up sooner orlater.

422
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:10,639
More tortillas?

423
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:12,434

This is Polkie, smells like horse
sweat but it don't taste so bad.

431
00:57:39,402 --> 00:57:40,835
The idea is to drink it right down.

00:57:57,654 --> 00:58:00,179
Tastes like horse sweat too, l think.

433
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:02,718

A day's ride over that snow.

01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:28,435
You're a disgrace to
your mother's rotten pigs.

497
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:32,908
When Gauche is finished with you,
l pray to God that he sends you to hell.

498
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,601
Well that's a very religious girl.

499
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:37,613
You bastard.

gambler in New Orleans,

01:07:05,735 --> 01:07:09,637
and that he deals cards with his left hand,
shoots a gun with his left hand.

509
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:12,871
Le Man Gauche they call him,
it's as good a name as any.

510
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,671
But why do you want to kill him?

511
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,427
Notlike that, let me have it.

512
01:07:40,203 --> 01:07:43,001
The Japanese, where did you find him?

513
01:07:43,673 --> 01:07:47,302
On the train, when someone
killed his friend Guess who?

Well, we'll see about that.

516
01:07:54,350 --> 01:08:00,414
You know, if you have been different to me
lf you had shown me alittle respect.

517
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:01,388
You mean like the Frenchman?

518
01:08:02,925 --> 01:08:06,759
He cares for me All you ever
cared about is yourself.

519

Well, that makes you and me the same.

520
01:08:10,066 --> 01:08:18,098
Ohristina, you're a whore,
you've always been one,
you'll always be one.

521
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:22,669
You always did know how to
speak to a woman.

522
01:08:22,712 --> 01:08:27,342
My offer still holds You help
me with Gauche, you'll get a
fair share of the loot.

523
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:29,480
How much?

524
01:08:30,987 --> 01:08:33,512
Enough to move you away from San Lucas,

525
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:36,121
and let you live anywhere
you want anywhere else.

526
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:39,720
But don't you take too
long making up your mind,

527
01:08:41,998 --> 01:08:43,761
because l'm going to
change mine pretty soon.

528
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,364
Give me my clothes.

529
01:09:27,844 --> 01:09:32,543
l'll give you your clothes, but first
l want yourword of honor that
you won't kill Gauche on sight.

530
01:09:33,883 --> 01:09:34,872
My clothes.

531
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:40,280
Yourword.

532
01:09:48,197 --> 01:09:49,755
Don't know what the hell that's all about,

533
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,892
but it sounds like it's coming from the heart.

534
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,272
Well?

535
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:02,477
Give me five minutes with him.

536
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:06,480
Not enough.

537
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:11,250
One hour Give me one full hour.

538
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,947
l need one full day.

539
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:19,456
Karoda, l need the time to make
Gauche to take me to the cash.

540
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:21,019
l want to be sure it's there.

541
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:22,796
No.

542
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:26,091
All right, you suit yourself.

543
01:10:39,148 --> 01:10:40,240
Turning blue.

544
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:45,484
Won't be long you won't be nothing
but a clump of ice, by nightfall

545
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:49,855
you'll be frozen into the landscape
and you'll never avenge your
friend or never get your sword.

546
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:55,395
You're going to end up in Japanese hell,
a disgrace to your ancestors.

547
01:10:57,867 --> 01:11:02,099
You have my word, l will not
kill the man until you say.

548
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:27,185
Don't take it so hard, l think
you're one hell of a man.

549
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:30,962
l think you are one son of a bitch.

550
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:21,406
Senior Gauche Senior Gauche.

551
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:27,155
They all meet you Senior,
they'll be there tomorrow By noon.

552
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:30,089
Hey, what happened to the others?

553
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:31,684
Where's Mace, where's Pepi?

554
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:37,598
Gauche, Link's still alive.

555
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:41,635
Oh, that's too damn bad for him.

556
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,401
He's got one of the Japanese with him
A real tough son of a bitch.

557
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:48,172
Sure, but they all die the same way.

558
01:12:48,844 --> 01:12:53,645
Okay, l, l didn't
want to have to tell you They got the girl.

559
01:12:56,519 --> 01:12:57,281
Who?

560
01:12:58,487 --> 01:13:00,978
Ohristina, Miss Ohristina, l mean.

561
01:13:16,706 --> 01:13:19,732
Hyatt, how is it you're
the only one that got away?

562
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:23,211
Yeah, tell us Lost your voice, huh?

563
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:03,913
Hurry, come on.

564
01:14:03,953 --> 01:14:05,682
Okay, okay, take it easy.

565
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:06,346
Horses.

566
01:14:06,388 --> 01:14:07,446
Hey the sword.

567
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:08,388
Don't forget the sword.

568
01:15:34,844 --> 01:15:38,678
The villagers that were here
had a choice, run orfight
Looks like they ran.

569
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:39,476
From what?

570
01:15:42,284 --> 01:15:45,879
Oomanches,
they came over the mountain, too.

571
01:15:49,258 --> 01:15:50,589
What are we going to do?

572
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:54,254
Well, the Oomanches would have
taken what they wanted,

573
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:55,661
so l guess this place is as safe as any other.

574
01:15:58,133 --> 01:16:01,500
And if l remember right, you're
along ways from being a good cook.

575
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:03,502
You get busy anyhow.

576
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:05,702
Why should l, you get busy?

577
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:09,902
You cook, you eat l cook,
you get whipped and go to bed hungry.

578
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:21,085
The thing l like about you Link,
the older you get the sweeter
you get, too Ohhh.

579
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:25,556
What about alittle Pokie,
l feel like loosening up a bit.

584
01:17:48,978 --> 01:17:50,639
l can't go on like this forever.

585
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:54,741
No, l guess you can't
Dark season gunman.

586
01:17:56,218 --> 01:17:58,778
Always some one new to come
along to take our place.

587
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:04,851
All right then
l'll help you with Gauche.

588
01:18:06,628 --> 01:18:10,621

gave you all sorts of respect.

589
01:18:11,133 --> 01:18:19,734
But he's not you, nobody is

Now l take off yours.

594
01:18:53,842 --> 01:18:54,809
Leave Gauche for you.

595
01:18:54,843 --> 01:18:58,006
You fool, he outsmarted you,
you'll never get that money.

596
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:04,816
Don't move, l'll kill you,
l swear l'll kill you Oh oh oh

597
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:23,031
That's Ohristina for you, never know
which gun she's going to reach for.

01:19:25,507 --> 01:19:26,337
Shit.

612
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:32,842
Get back.

613
01:24:36,017 --> 01:24:36,779
Thanks.

614
01:24:57,773 --> 01:25:01,641
Oh no, that band is so tight

615
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:44,915
You all right?

616
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:50,122
Well, you cost us about two hours
already, let's get out of here.

617
01:25:54,129 --> 01:25:58,930
Oh oh my God Oh oh oh

618
01:26:44,379 --> 01:26:45,778
Oomanches, again?

619
01:26:45,814 --> 01:26:47,213
Yeah, they get around.

620
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:52,848
So damned many tracks around here,

621
01:26:52,888 --> 01:26:53,980
you can't tell who's come or gone.

622
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:58,517
But who's hidden over there
waiting for us to show?

623
01:27:03,465 --> 01:27:04,432
l go first.

624
01:27:04,466 --> 01:27:10,200
No, l'll go with her, you hang
back until l call you in.

625
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:11,865
Sure wish you could use one of these.

626
01:27:13,842 --> 01:27:14,866
No need.

627
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:20,974
Yes, there's a need Maybe
some day l'll teach you.

628
01:27:21,516 --> 01:27:25,316
When your swords hanging in the
White House and l'm so rich
it's disgusting.

629
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:32,153
Well, if old Gauche is in there,
you're going to find out right
now how much he loves you.

630
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:35,181
Well, l guess we just wait.

631
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:37,306
What for?

632
01:29:44,926 --> 01:29:46,257
Throw it, Link.

633
01:29:58,773 --> 01:30:01,003
You, what's your name?

634
01:30:02,711 --> 01:30:03,735
Karoda Juri.

635
01:30:03,778 --> 01:30:08,511
Well Karoda, looks like you found me
You still intend to see me dead?

636
01:30:09,284 --> 01:30:11,377
Uh huh lt's possible.

637
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:16,186
Just because l'm the nervous type,
the knives, put them out of reach.

638
01:30:42,584 --> 01:30:43,812
Oheck under his robe.

639
01:30:49,524 --> 01:30:52,823
Madre mia, look at this arsenal.

640
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:58,863
Gauche, they saved my life
l, l tried to escape but
the Oomanches caught me, and..

641
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:06,932
Oh yeah? Thanks, Link
What can l do for you?

642
01:31:08,576 --> 01:31:10,476
Well, you can give my friend
here his sword,

643
01:31:11,146 --> 01:31:17,608
tell me where the gold is hid,
and then you can take a high
dive in alow well.

644
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:26,026
Yeah, that's what l thought
Hyatt wants you for himself
You got a preference?

645
01:31:26,094 --> 01:31:29,188
Please, you can'tlet him do it,
you can't Please, Gauche.

646
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,060
Hyatt.

647
01:31:30,098 --> 01:31:31,759
Oome on, Link, you're coming with me.

648
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:09,798
Give me the sword.

649
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:11,668
Boss, boss The sword, he wants the sword.

650
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:13,469
What the hell, give him the God damned thing.

651
01:32:16,177 --> 01:32:16,871
Thank you.

652
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:42,997
You all right?

653
01:33:43,665 --> 01:33:44,757
Uh huh.

654
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:45,792
Don't worry.

655
01:33:47,702 --> 01:33:52,401
Well, l figure they'll either
burn us out orwait us out.

656
01:33:54,142 --> 01:33:55,700
What did you do with your horses?

657
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:57,902
Hid on the way up in the
cane brake.

658
01:33:57,946 --> 01:34:00,141
Well now, that wasn't very
damned smart.

659
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:04,009
They won't do anybody good
except the Oomanches.

660
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:08,012
What do you suggest?

661
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:16,529
Gauche, l suggest you stay alive,
l don't care how you do it,
but you stay alive.

662
01:34:18,299 --> 01:34:21,791
Unless of course, you want to
tell me right now where you hid the gold.

663
01:34:27,909 --> 01:34:37,045
Well, when the time comes,
l'm going to have to beat
it out of you, and that's all right, too.

664
01:35:06,647 --> 01:35:07,841
What do you think?

665
01:35:08,549 --> 01:35:09,516
Yeah.

666
01:38:20,675 --> 01:38:25,135
Hey, over here Oh.

667
01:38:54,842 --> 01:38:57,072
Hyatt's dead, so is Shadow.

668
01:38:58,946 --> 01:39:01,244
Yeah, the next thing that
they'll do is set fire to this cane.

669
01:39:05,152 --> 01:39:07,245
You think you can chop a fire break?

670
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:09,678
Yeah.

671
01:39:37,184 --> 01:39:37,912

Oause if you kill me, you'll never
find the money.

A quarter of a million dollars

That's stupid Bad You close to border
They catch you, hang you.

688
01:43:58,512 --> 01:44:02,608
Uh huh, listen, you believe that,
you believe anything.

689
01:44:03,384 --> 01:44:08,048
You do this for me? You take it back?

690
01:44:08,756 --> 01:44:13,716
Sure Hell, l ain't
got nothing else to do.

691
01:44:14,595 --> 01:44:15,926
All right.

692
01:44:17,831 --> 01:44:19,458
Here, l'll do it, l'll do it.

693
01:44:34,348 --> 01:44:35,542
What?

694
01:44:39,587 --> 01:44:44,047
Ah, oh oh, so, everything is good Ah.

695
01:44:46,327 --> 01:44:47,954
Yeah, that, that's right.

696
01:45:18,826 --> 01:45:20,521
You'll neverfind the money, Link.

697
01:45:23,063 --> 01:45:26,328
Oh, l know you, you'll keep on looking.

698
01:45:27,001 --> 01:45:28,901
But it won't do you any good.

699
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:32,896
There is no one alive who
knows where Gauche hid it.

700
01:45:35,743 --> 01:45:36,675
Except...

701
01:45:38,445 --> 01:45:40,413
l've heard him talking,
once about something,

702
01:45:40,781 --> 01:45:42,146
and he stopped to pick up something.

703
01:45:42,683 --> 01:45:45,277
Something in small bags that clinked.

704
01:45:48,756 --> 01:45:51,122
lf you want, we could team up together.

705
01:45:53,694 --> 01:45:56,891
Well, lt's an idea.

706
01:45:56,930 --> 01:45:58,124
Then you'll take me with you?

707
01:45:58,165 --> 01:45:58,790
Sure.

708
01:45:58,832 --> 01:46:00,766
Oh good, that's wonderful.

709
01:46:02,436 --> 01:46:04,199
But only as far as San Lucas.

710
01:46:05,406 --> 01:46:07,135
Oh, you bastard.

711
01:46:08,676 --> 01:46:12,043
Now that's the Ohristina
l'll always like to remember.
