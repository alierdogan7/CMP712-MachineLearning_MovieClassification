1
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,555
Leave it go, the strongbox.

2
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,634
<i>Keep your seats, señores.</i>

3
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,150
- lf this is a holdup, why...
- Shut up!

4
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,309
- We haven't...
- Shut up, you too, boy!

5
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,917
Why we go so slow?

6
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,872
<i>Come on, señores. Get out.</i>

7
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,790
- Welcome to Arizona, Adam.
- John.

8
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,520
Meet my foreman Hermando.
Herman for short.

9
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,513
This crazy brigand used to
raid me so much in the old days...

10
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,717
...I had to hire him.
But he's been honest ever since.

11
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,431
I sure scare you out of the daylights,
eh, Mr. Stewart?

12
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,670
You did. It was a well-played joke.

13
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,479
- I don't think it's so funny.
- You must be Howie.

14
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,279
- You look like a Stewart.
- Yeah?

15
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,314
- Glad to meet you, Uncle John.
- Last time I saw you...

16
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,994
...you were a year old.
We'll have to get reacquainted.

17
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,232
Folks, this is the biggest day
in my life.

18
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,119
The guest of honour
is my brother Adam from Ohio.

19
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,518
He's a fine lawyer, and now
that he's going to be one of us...

20
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,591
...we'll finally have
some law in Ocatilla.

21
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,876
- Glad to have you settle here.
- Thank you.

22
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,951
John's been talking about you
for months.

23
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,554
- Glad to be here.
- This is Sheriff and Mrs. Gibbons.

24
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,517
They were married only last week.

25
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,751
- This is my son, Howie.
- How do you do?

26
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,194
- Hello.
- Howie.

27
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,237
You'll get to know everybody
soon enough.

28
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,630
Oh, Bill. Roll that coach out of here.

29
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,075
Hey, get those fiddles
and guitars going.

30
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,959
Come on, dance up, everybody.
We're going to have a gala.

31
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,632
Put it on that table over there.
Hurry up now.

32
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,878
I've been saving Corinne
for the last.

33
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,759
Adam, Howie, this is Mrs. Michaels,
my best girl.

34
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,717
He just calls me that.
I'm not really.

35
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,472
- How do you do?
- Yes, you are too.

36
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,551
Organize a party for me,
beginning to end.

37
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,314
A party needs a woman's touch,
and at a time like this...

38
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,516
...I always chase into town
for her help.

39
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,875
I can't imagine where
you could do better, John.

40
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,359
Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

41
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,637
Howie, how do you think
you're going to like living in Arizona?

42
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,349
Well, I don't know.
I liked it all right in Cincinnati.

43
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,910
Oh, Wick, I want you to meet
my brother Adam.

44
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,479
- Wick Campbell.
- How do you do?

45
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,119
- My nephew Howie.
- Howie.

46
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,032
<i>And Señorita Segura.</i>

47
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,076
Adam, Campbell is almost
as big in the town of Ocatilla...

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,151
...or so he thinks,
as I am in the valleys.

49
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,390
He'll probably throw you
a lot of business.

50
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,552
You can be sure of that. But I'm
small potatoes compared to John.

51
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,950
He runs everything
for 100 miles around Ocatilla.

52
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,394
I don't run anything, Wick.

53
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,711
But I like to help a man
build on his own, as I did you.

54
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,677
I haven't forgotten it, Stewart.

55
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,708
- He won't let me.
- That's right.

56
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,231
Howie, you and Maria
should be dancing.

57
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,476
Go on. Wick won't mind.
He can't dance. He's all mule feet.

58
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,758
May I?

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,910
Would you mind sitting this one out?
I'd like to talk to you.

60
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,879
Please?

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,949
Excuse us, Corinne?
I'd like a minute with Adam.

62
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,599
Naturally, after 18 years.

63
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,035
Come along. I want to
show you something.

64
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,831
I thought maybe we could
get better acquainted here.

65
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,912
- Do you live in Ocatilla?
- Yes.

66
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,470
Well, that's great. I'll be living there,
too, with my father.

67
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,796
I'll have a lot of free time on my hands.
Maybe we can spend it together.

68
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,837
Can I get you anything,
Mr. Campbell?

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,150
I can find what I want.

70
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,552
John's oldest friends,
late for his party.

71
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,554
We had to stay behind to see
that the holdup went off all right.

72
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,473
Well, it looks as though John
has got everything...

73
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,551
...he ever hoped for.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,270
Where in town do you live?

75
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,909
It doesn't matter.

76
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,668
- What are you so nervous about?
- Nothing. Why?

77
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,591
What's your hookup with Campbell?
Are you his steady girl or something?

78
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,274
Oh, no. No, I am not his girl.

79
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,558
Well, I shouldn't think so.
He's old enough to be your father.

80
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,676
Please, we dance. Yes?

81
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,393
All right.

82
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,029
Did you ever see a sight like that?
You never get tired looking at it.

83
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,951
In the beginning,
the Apaches came...

84
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,795
...and burned me to the ground
four times, but they couldn't kill me.

85
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,678
Bandits swept across
the Rio Grande...

86
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,196
...stole my cattle and horses time
and again. I killed three of them.

87
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,430
But I branded more cattle,
all I could find.

88
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,149
Mavericks that were running wild
because there was no market for cattle.

89
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,116
Then the markets opened, and I drove
thousands of longhorns to Abilene...

90
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,317
...Wichita and Dodge as the price
went from a dollar a head to 30.

91
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,754
And that did it.

92
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,388
Look, Adam, from the Bask Grande
to the Bonita River.

93
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,394
As far as you can see,
everything is mine.

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,075
- I'm proud of you, John.
- And I'm proud of myself.

95
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,231
All the years of fighting are behind.

96
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,992
When settlers came
to this valley...

97
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,435
...there was only the adobe village
of Ocatilla...

98
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,160
...which the Mexicans and the Indians
had started to build.

99
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,871
We finished it for them. And now
we've got the start of a real town.

100
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,316
And as the first attorney,
you'll mean law and peace.

101
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,711
And you'll make them strong,
and you'll make them last.

102
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,713
You place great faith in me, John,
but I'll do my best.

103
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,199
Sure.

104
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,590
You're a Stewart, aren't you?

105
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,830
I don't like strangers
dancing with Maria.

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,911
If she wants to dance,
that's her business.

107
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,150
- It's my business.
- Oh, Wick, please.

108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,151
Flirting with him
because he's a Stewart.

109
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,039
- Now, listen, mister.
- You keep away from her at all times.

110
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,952
- You understand?
- Campbell!

111
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,588
I invite a man to my house,
he acts like a gentleman.

112
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,558
- He was pawing her.
- I was not. I didn't do anything.

113
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,073
I'm sure you weren't, Howie.

114
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,676
Keep on playing.
Go on dancing, folks.

115
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,956
I'm getting tired of you
telling me what to do.

116
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,633
Get out of here
till you sober up.

117
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,075
- We're going.
- Maria, you are always welcome...

118
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,549
...just the same as your father was.
- Come on.

119
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,633
- I'd like to...
- Let's have some refreshments.

120
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,039
Maria!

121
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,794
Keep away from me.

122
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,629
- You're acting like a little fool.
- Why do you act the way you do?

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,678
All because I would have fun
dancing with that Stewart boy.

124
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,956
No other man dances with you.

125
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,076
Most of all a Stewart.

126
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,913
Your jealousy is like a craziness.

127
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,469
Maria, when your father
was killed in my saloon...

128
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,631
...you were homeless.
I felt sorry for you.

129
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,438
I wanted to make it up to you.

130
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,077
- I gave you everything. All this.
- I did not know how it would be.

131
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,629
I did not think that
you would fall in love with me.

132
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,075
Or what you call love.

133
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,997
I do love you.

134
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,796
You've grown into
a beautiful young woman...

135
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,351
...and no man's going to
have you but me.

136
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,992
So you'll take and own me...

137
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,276
...like you do everything else...

138
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,192
...no matter how I feel.

139
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,998
That's right.

140
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,593
When I close that saloon tonight,
I'm coming back here.

141
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,471
And you'll be waiting.

142
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,993
- Better give me another one of those.
- Why all the champagne?

143
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,435
What is this,
your wedding night?

144
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,318
Wedding night.

145
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,836
Yeah, that's what I am,
a blushing bridegroom.

146
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,759
Maria.

147
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,153
Maria!

148
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,553
Maria!

149
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,554
- Maria!
- What's wrong?

150
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,073
- Where is she?
- Miss Segura?

151
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,435
- She left a couple hours ago.
- Where'd she go?

152
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,160
I don't know, but she said
she wouldn't come back ever.

153
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,313
I know where she went.

154
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,989
Herman, I want you to take Howie
with you today...

155
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,550
...when you check that south range.
- Whatever you say, boss.

156
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,672
- Pretty early for you, ain't it?
- Maria rode out here last night.

157
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,114
I've come to take her back.

158
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,555
She's here to stay.
She wants no part of you.

159
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,190
She's the only thing
that matters to me.

160
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,873
She's all I think about.

161
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,233
You wouldn't understand that.

162
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,834
Lately, I don't understand
much of anything about you.

163
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,509
You could talk to her.
Tell her I'll be good to her.

164
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,468
No. The girl's afraid of you.
It's as simple as that.

165
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,951
- You have no right to interfere!
- Right? She needed help.

166
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,795
You know, Campbell,
you're not thinking straight.

167
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,032
Since you've become a big man,
you have the idea that everything...

168
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,078
...should be done the way you want it,
and that's dangerous.

169
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,630
Better straighten yourself out
before somebody does it for you.

170
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,792
- You, Stewart?
- Possibly.

171
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,755
For days those hard cases
have been drifting in...

172
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,708
...from the tough towns in the West.
- I know, Dad. I wish I knew why.

173
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,474
Well, I know one thing,
they're professional gun hawks...

174
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,914
...every last one of them.

175
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,310
Your father's right, sheriff,
they are gun hawks.

176
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,072
Why don't you run them
out of town?

177
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,038
You can't go chasing strangers
just because they look ornery.

178
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,633
They gotta break the law first.

179
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,553
I don't like it.
There's gonna be trouble.

180
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,195
Marva's fixing some stew, Dad.
It's your favourite.

181
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,396
- Coming to supper?
- No. No, thanks, son.

182
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,313
I'll leave you two newlyweds alone.

183
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,716
Scavo. Welcome to Ocatilla.

184
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,316
Hello, Campbell.
Well, time hasn't changed you much.

185
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,357
Greedy-looking as ever.

186
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,478
Picked up the Colton Brothers here
on their way out of Kansas...

187
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,438
...moving fast.
- Glad to know you.

188
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,194
Al Drucker, Dave Weed
and some of the others you know...

189
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,476
...are already inside. Come on in.

190
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,390
Scavo, you know Drucker, Weed.

191
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,556
- Give these boys anything they want.
- Mr. Campbell, you ought to know...

192
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,950
...these fellas got no bottoms
to their stomachs.

193
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,874
- They'll eat and drink you dry.
- Did I ask you? Set them up.

194
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,392
We want to know when this ball
we've been invited to is gonna open.

195
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,913
Stewart's already opened it.

196
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,277
And I'm gonna close it,
with your help.

197
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,913
And I'm gonna start right now.

198
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,715
Well, Grinnel,
I've been expecting you.

199
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,598
I know.

200
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,239
And don't think I don't know...

201
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,392
...why you want my ranch in particular,
Campbell, because I do.

202
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,959
Why is that, Tod?

203
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,872
Well...

204
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,076
...it's because my ranch...

205
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,470
...butts right up against
Stewart's land.

206
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,149
Now, if you got a foothold
on the range...

207
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,995
...you'd be figuring out some scheme
to whittle John down to your level.

208
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,839
- Of course you're wrong about that.
- Am I?

209
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,640
Everybody knows you hate him
from here to breakfast...

210
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,109
...for keeping that Mexican girl
out of your reach.

211
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,557
Tod, I thought you were here
to talk about that loan on your ranch.

212
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,791
It's due today.

213
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,872
You wouldn't be thinking of giving me
an extension, would you?

214
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,033
- Can't afford it.
- No. That's what I was afeard of.

215
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,193
Your only reason for loaning me
that money in the beginning...

216
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,830
...was because you were sure
I'd never be able to repay it.

217
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,837
Well, I've got a surprise for you.

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,197
I'm going to pay that loan in full.

219
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,634
In cash.

220
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,311
So you can fork out that note
and mark it...

221
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,754
...cancelled.

222
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,435
The money will be here
on the noon stage.

223
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,398
Tod, I'm real glad to hear it.

224
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,551
I hate to see a hardship
worked on any man.

225
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,439
Red, go across the street
and get that lawyer Adam Stewart.

226
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,831
We'll settle this all legally
and right now. Go ahead.

227
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,197
And I'll buy you a drink to celebrate.

228
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,715
Well, that's real nice of you, Wick.

229
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,711
- What'll you have?
- Bourbon.

230
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,438
Two bourbons.

231
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,237
It seems a shame to take half
your office from you, Mrs. Michaels.

232
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,756
There's just no other place in this town
for an office, as John told you.

233
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,558
Besides, there's plenty of room.

234
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,278
You're very kind.

235
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,670
Of course,
I don't have any clients as yet.

236
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,831
You will. Your brother's
been drumming up...

237
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,399
...business for you for weeks.

238
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,670
How long have you known John?

239
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,512
Almost 10 years.

240
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,671
About the time my husband died.

241
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,434
We'd just moved here
and built this house.

242
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,919
I decided to stay...

243
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,152
...so John asked Mr. Carr
to give me a job in the freighter office.

244
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,080
What's this I hear about
you being his best girl?

245
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,636
That's just his way
of joking with me.

246
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,308
Well, if he had any sense,
he shouldn't joke about it.

247
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,198
I can see you don't know John.

248
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,513
Building his ranch, raising cattle,
helping this town to prosper...

249
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,955
...hasn't left him very much time
for the ladies.

250
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,430
- He's been much too busy.
- Yes.

251
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,398
- He told me so.
- Mr. Stewart.

252
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,951
Mr. Campbell would like to see you.

253
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,519
He has some lawyer business.

254
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,591
You see? A client already.

255
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,990
- Would you mind?
- Yes.

256
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,272
- Sheriff, I'm glad you're here too.
- What's the story?

257
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,273
Tod Grinnel came in here
begging for an extension on a loan...

258
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,635
...I hold on his ranch. I refused him.

259
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,950
He went crazy
and drew down on me.

260
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,554
Guess you heard the first shot.
That was his.

261
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,950
I had to kill him in self-defence.

262
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,908
- That right?
- Just like he said. We all saw it.

263
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,557
Mr. Stewart,
this is my first job for you.

264
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,713
You'll have to foreclose this mortgage
I hold on Tod Grinnel's ranch.

265
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,314
I thought Grinnel was your friend.

266
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,516
That's what makes it so sad.

267
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,238
I've known Tod for years.

268
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,709
First time I was ever forced
to kill a man...

269
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,314
...and it had to be a friend of mine.

270
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,589
Have some hot coffee
before you turn in.

271
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,799
No.

272
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,794
I shot some breakfast for us.
I'm sick of those Mexican flapjacks.

273
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,270
What's the matter
with the Mexican flaps?

274
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,676
You don't like too much
this ranch work, do you, Howie?

275
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,512
- You can have it.
- And how happen you took the job?

276
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,599
It was Uncle John's idea.
Said it'd be good for me.

277
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,759
You know, boy...

278
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,559
...the fever get
in your blood someday...

279
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,312
...like it did your uncle.

280
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,072
You can have him too.

281
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,196
Give me a cup of coffee.

282
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,395
Stewart's running too many cattle
for his range.

283
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,869
Maybe we should ship
some of them for him.

284
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,316
It's a good idea. Saves grass.
Go ahead.

285
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,795
It's Red Dawes, one of Wick
Campbell's men. I know him.

286
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,431
Campbell never can do this
to us Stewarts.

287
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,835
Look. They're coming back
to get him. Let's go.

288
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,914
Let them go.
We can't catch them now.

289
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,074
You see.

290
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,040
They take the cattle
to Campbell's ranch.

291
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,313
Yes, that's Campbell's trail herd
on the way to market.

292
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,993
- Any of them yours?
- Can't tell...

293
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,878
...but he's had time to rebrand them.

294
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,999
Campbell never take over
that many cattle from Tod Grinnel.

295
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,197
Come on, we'll follow them
to the loading pens.

296
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,837
There you are, Mr. Campbell.

297
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,878
The tally shows 1217 head.
A big shipment.

298
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,076
Just what my tally shows, Campbell.

299
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,958
Now, what business
is this of yours?

300
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,351
I know the late Tod Grinnel was
running slightly less than 1000 head...

301
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,511
...when you inherited his ranch.

302
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,319
- What of it?
- Happens I lost around 300 head...

303
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,152
...the other night...

304
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,709
...which makes up the difference
for the increase.

305
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,313
And many of the brands...

306
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,516
...they plenty fresh,
huh, Mr. Campbell?

307
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,991
If you'll check carefully,
you'll find that all the brands are fresh.

308
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,709
I'm in the cattle business to stay now,
and I rebranded Tod Grinnel's herd...

309
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,192
...with my own new, registered brand:
the Broken-Bar-O.

310
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,430
And you haven't any case
against me at all.

311
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,158
No?

312
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,480
This is Red Dawes' vest.
One of your hired hands.

313
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,235
- He'll be glad to get it back.
- He won't need it.

314
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,590
He was stampeded to death
rustling my cattle.

315
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,593
So Red turned to that?
I knew he was bad.

316
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,309
That's why I fired him a week ago.
You still haven't any case against me.

317
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,071
- What about it, Adam?
- It's his word against what you believe.

318
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,596
Not much evidence to give before
a court of law, without witnesses.

319
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,398
And you haven't any.

320
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,233
See, this law that protects you
also works for me.

321
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,392
You don't like that. Maybe you were
better off in the old days...

322
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,551
...when you took and kept
what you wanted...

323
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,712
...with a hard fist and a fast gun.

324
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,353
That's the last time you'll ever
throw anything in my face, Stewart.

325
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,350
There's one of them now.

326
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,630
That's John Stewart's nephew.

327
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,238
Good-looking fella, and young.

328
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,791
I can see how that Mexican gal would
like it better at the ranch than with you.

329
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,197
That's no way for you
to be losing your temper.

330
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,794
You're paying us good money
for that sort of thing...

331
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,679
...and now you want to have
all the fun yourself.

332
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,154
Pull a paper, fellas. High wins.

333
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,470
Let me have him, Scavo.

334
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,278
He's just my size.

335
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,879
Kid's yours, Weed. Take him.

336
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,833
Well, you don't have to push.

337
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,592
I don't?

338
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,352
And who are you?

339
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,397
My name's Stewart.

340
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,996
So you're a Stewart...

341
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,674
...from the big ranch in the valley.

342
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,357
Any of them Stewarts I hate.

343
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,154
I get all worked up.

344
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,151
I hate them so much I could kill.

345
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,075
Feel the same way
myself sometimes.

346
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,318
Look, fella, why don't you
have another drink.

347
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,352
Didn't you hear what I said
about the Stewarts?

348
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,877
Yeah, but I don't want to...
To fight you about it.

349
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,071
You're going to.

350
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,199
But I don't have a gun.

351
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,555
Then find one now.

352
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,472
I'll walk outside for a minute...

353
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,710
...then walk back in.

354
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,352
Who does he think he's fooling?

355
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,076
He ain't fooling.
He meant what he said.

356
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,673
He wouldn't.

357
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,195
Not when I don't have a gun.

358
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,559
Take mine, boy.

359
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,593
I don't want it.

360
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,069
I'm not afraid.
I just don't want to fight anybody.

361
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,840
I don't want your gun, fella.

362
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,951
Stewart did it, sheriff.

363
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,236
Killed him with my gun.

364
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,117
What a dirty trick I played
on that poor young punk.

365
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,156
But you can't let me stay here.
I'm innocent.

366
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,959
Every man there swore
that the dead man was only joking...

367
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,839
...when Howie suddenly
grabbed Scavo's gun and shot.

368
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,719
- I had to bring him in.
- They lied. I shot in self-defence.

369
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,110
We know that, Howie.
So does Clyde.

370
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,317
Then why am I in jail?
Why can't I get out on bail?

371
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,279
I'm sorry, Howie,
but bail isn't allowed in a killing.

372
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,794
Your father knows that too.

373
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,474
He's been riding all day
looking for the circuit judge.

374
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,596
- He's long overdue.
- Yeah.

375
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,751
Wait for the circuit judge.

376
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,911
With all those witnesses
calling me a liar.

377
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,718
You'll have a fair trial.

378
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,632
Then you'll be legally free.

379
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,189
Thanks. Thanks for nothing.

380
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,391
Put out your hands.

381
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,592
Now turn around.

382
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,834
- Well, what's all this for?
- Well, I'm taking no chances.

383
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,389
Anything happens to you,
Campbell will break my neck.

384
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,993
Come on.

385
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,953
Sit down.

386
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,436
We'll play some poker.

387
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,117
For chips. I'll collect later.

388
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,872
What are you doing?

389
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,679
I dropped a card.
These irons get in my way.

390
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,592
I'll get it.

391
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,837
What the devil?

392
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,592
I don't want to kill you...

393
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,320
...so do what I say and do it exactly,
or I will.

394
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,357
Now, easy, Howie. Easy.

395
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,795
Get the keys
and take off these irons.

396
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,474
I ain't got them, Howie.
The sheriff's got them on him.

397
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,358
- Don't stall me.
- So help me, Howie...

398
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,238
...now, that's the only set there is.

399
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,119
Now, why don't you settle down.
You can't get away.

400
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,999
And I won't say nothing
about your trying.

401
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,077
Get that ax, and be careful.

402
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,428
Split the chain on my ankles.

403
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,278
And swing straight.

404
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,516
Give me your gun belt.

405
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,311
Inside. Hurry up.

406
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,395
If you're heading to Stewart's
for his nephew...

407
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,391
...don't waste your time.
He ain't there.

408
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,437
- How do you know?
- I've been working there...

409
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,431
...keeping my eyes open,
like you wanted.

410
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,160
I had them open at daybreak
when that kid Howie rode in.

411
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,471
He went to the blacksmith shop,
cut off his handcuffs and leg irons.

412
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,232
I figured he escaped from jail.

413
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,789
Next, he got some grub and stuff,
then left again.

414
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,190
- His uncle help him?
- No, Maria Segura.

415
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,920
He knocked on her window,
talked to her, then rode away.

416
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,197
A minute later, she sneaked out
with a saddlebag and rode after him.

417
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,749
Stewart didn't know a thing about it
until he got up.

418
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,229
- Did she run off with that kid?
- It looked like it.

419
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,356
- I'll find him.
- And the girl?

420
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,876
You wouldn't want us busting up a
budding romance like that, would you?

421
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,951
Don't bait me, Scavo!

422
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,591
He ain't in there.

423
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,512
- Where is he?
- How do I know?

424
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,750
Mr. Stewart doesn't
tell me his business.

425
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,115
He just drove away
some time ago.

426
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,035
His team and wagon are gone.

427
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,871
Thanks very much, Mrs. Michaels.

428
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,758
It's not important anyway.

429
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,231
There's only one road
he could have taken.

430
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,038
His brother's ranch.

431
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,271
Campbell insisted on seeing Adam.

432
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,318
When I told him he'd driven away,
he said it wasn't important.

433
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,072
- That all?
- They headed out of town.

434
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,913
I didn't tell them that Adam
was on his way to see you.

435
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,799
- Howie is the one that bunch is after.
- Where is Howie now?

436
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,439
I don't know.

437
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,076
I'll have to catch Adam.

438
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,994
There he is.

439
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,151
- What's the meaning of this?
- What's the idea? Where you going?

440
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,914
None of your business,
but I was going to see my brother.

441
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,038
In such a hurry? You mean
you were going to see your son.

442
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,031
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

443
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,431
- He's not at the Stewart ranch.
- No.

444
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,636
He ran off with that Mexican filly.

445
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,118
You do know where he is,
and you'd better tell me.

446
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,238
I don't know.
And even if I did, I wouldn't...

447
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,956
- Where's the kid?
- You're crazy, Campbell.

448
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,831
- You're insane, Campbell. You...
- Where is he?!

449
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,230
I don't know, I tell you.
I don't know.

450
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,076
Those men killed him.

451
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,550
Campbell and the others.

452
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,829
They're the only ones
who could have.

453
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,912
Because of me.

454
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,429
Well, I'll kill them too.

455
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,395
And I'll get Campbell first.

456
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,073
What's to be done now, John?

457
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,310
What Campbell is up to
is pretty clear.

458
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,597
And then we ride, like in old times.
Shoot him down.

459
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,877
No. That's what he wants us to do.
It would justify his violence.

460
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,157
You and the sheriff get word to
Jason Carr, Green and Tom Baines...

461
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,471
...to meet us at the freight office.
- All right, John.

462
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,634
- Maria, where's Howie?
- I hide him at the little ranch...

463
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,030
...of Miguel Ruiz,
once a friend of my father's.

464
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,078
- Why didn't you tell me?
- He was afraid you'd send him to jail.

465
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,629
He's getting his guns.
He swears he'll kill Campbell.

466
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,268
- I tried to stop him. He wouldn't listen.
- Come on.

467
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,676
- Why'd you tell him, Maria?
- I had to.

468
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,229
- Give me that gun, Howie.
- No. Stay back.

469
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,674
I know what I've gotta do.

470
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,912
Because you threw a lucky shot once,
you think you can do it again.

471
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,672
You wouldn't stand a chance.

472
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,273
Stand back, Uncle John.

473
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,873
Oh, please, Howie. Listen.

474
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,473
No.

475
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,718
You're really to blame
for all this.

476
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,270
You made my father come here, where
he had no place to be. Now he's dead.

477
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,432
You killed him as much as anybody,
because you wanted your law...

478
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,999
...to take care of everything.

479
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,071
You can look at it that way.
I am to blame.

480
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,878
But I'm not going to
have you killed too.

481
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,076
You're afraid to fight him.
Well, I'm not.

482
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,270
Give me the gun.
I'll handle this my way.

483
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,150
What are you planning to do,
serve some papers on Mr. Campbell?

484
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,675
Look, Howie, this is a man's job.

485
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,273
Then who'll do it? You?

486
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,510
Don't come any closer.
You're not...

487
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,677
He'll be all right. Look after him.
Keep him here till I get back.

488
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,628
Why the back door?

489
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,917
I wanted to see the town
before it saw me.

490
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,799
- Still coming in.
- All afternoon. Several of them.

491
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,351
Tell Jason and the others,
when they come...

492
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,317
...that things have been changed.

493
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,277
You're wearing a gun.

494
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,998
What's brought
this change in you?

495
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,832
- Howie.
- John, all this could end...

496
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,831
...if you'd send Maria
back to Campbell.

497
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,389
She's why he hates so much,
isn't she?

498
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,834
Partly.

499
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,389
If Maria went back
it would be the end of her.

500
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,755
Could you ask her to do it?

501
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,399
- No.
- I didn't think so.

502
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,152
This fight isn't only over a girl.

503
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,709
Campbell has grown
as big as he can within the law.

504
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,269
Now he's using violence
to take him to the top.

505
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,269
- I'm standing in his way.
- You'll be killed.

506
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,476
The last to fight
and the first to die.

507
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,835
No, you forget Adam.

508
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,753
Oh, you got a winner at last.

509
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,790
John Stewart himself.

510
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,958
- You must be Frank Scavo.
- That's right, Mr. Stewart.

511
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,754
What can I do for you?

512
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,911
Thought Wick Campbell
might be here.

513
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,435
No, he don't happen to be around.

514
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,675
Least I don't see him.

515
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,071
- You seen him, Drucker?
- Why, no, I ain't.

516
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,073
If there's anything
we can do to oblige you...

517
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,999
There's nothing right now.

518
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,718
Well, anytime.

519
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,629
Plan to be in Ocatilla long,
Mr. Scavo?

520
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,673
Why, yes. Come here
on account of the climate.

521
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,512
Campbell said
we'd get real healthy.

522
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,511
Recently it hasn't been too healthy
for several people.

523
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,911
But if we could have a few more
new, fine, upstanding citizens...

524
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,470
...like you men, Ocatilla would soon
get a name for itself.

525
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,992
Good night.

526
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,833
Come on.

527
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,593
Stewart.

528
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,112
Good night.

529
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,072
Stand up, Campbell.

530
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,798
Stand up.

531
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,837
You're a born sucker, Stewart.

532
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,319
Bigger than I ever seen.

533
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,755
Oh, yeah? You're pretty smart.

534
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,831
Now, Mr. Campbell
dreamed this one up.

535
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,833
He figured you'd come storming
after your brother's shooting.

536
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,515
And I got the privilege of greeting you
because your nephew killed my friend.

537
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,991
Make your first shot count, Drucker.

538
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,513
I always do.

539
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,479
Now they find you dead
because you came busting in here...

540
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,437
...trying to murder
poor Mr. Campbell.

541
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,434
I might even get a reward
out of this, eh? Sucker.

542
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,309
Find Stewart. Find him and kill him.

543
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,075
Liar. Bragged he was
a first-rate gunslinger.

544
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,755
Brandy, Kansas,
ride out and cover all roads.

545
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,992
- He'll be heading out of town.
- All right. Get moving.

546
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,038
Campbell, I saw him heading around
back of the freight office.

547
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,553
That's interesting.

548
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,837
All right, men.
Save the horseflesh.

549
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,195
Go to your homes.
You're to have no part of this.

550
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,874
What's got into you?
Trying to cut down Campbell alone.

551
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,634
- Didn't Corinne tell you?
- We're all in this, or will be.

552
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,837
That's what I'm trying to prevent.
Takes one man to stop Campbell.

553
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,513
Without him, the rest will leave.

554
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,989
I'm the reason for this trouble.
I wanna finish it.

555
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,991
This badge doesn't mean
anything anymore.

556
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,072
- Only a target for Campbell's guns.
- But you pinned it on me.

557
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,151
Forget it. There's no law in Ocatilla.

558
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,753
Stewart!

559
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,439
We know you're in there.

560
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,114
Come out or we're coming in.

561
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,034
I thought I got away safely.
I'd never bring them here.

562
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,758
Make it quick, Stewart.

563
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,718
Looks like we've got
all the foxes bottled up in one hole.

564
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,393
Cut loose.

565
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,754
Maybe it's only you they want,
Stewart, and not us.

566
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,275
But if they should break in here...

567
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,317
John, you can't do it.

568
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,754
Green may be right.

569
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,309
Do you think if they killed you,
that would save us?

570
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,392
You're the leader. Without you,
there'd be nothing to stop them.

571
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,393
What they would do here
could happen to any house in town.

572
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,790
We're in for a siege. Got nothing
to fight back with but two pistols.

573
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,157
We'll all die like rats in a trap.
I'm gonna run for it.

574
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,548
Shut up. Stay down.

575
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,879
John.

576
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,317
Jason, Tom, Henry.

577
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,514
These were my husband's.
I packed them away years ago.

578
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,830
Jason, better go in with Clyde.

579
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,116
Tom, cover this window here.

580
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,794
Henry, take the back door.

581
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,596
Corinne, I'm sorry
I had to bring this on you.

582
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,274
Don't be. I'm glad you're here, alive.

583
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,829
When daylight comes
so they can see who you are...

584
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,116
...I wish you'd leave.
Even if they hold you...

585
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,033
...you'll be safer than in this house.
- I want to be here.

586
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,919
Remember? I'm your best girl.

587
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,469
<i>Señor, don't go.</i>

588
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,155
Bad men, they shoot everybody.

589
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,838
Hear?

590
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,399
Who are they shooting at?

591
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,120
<i>People in the señora's house.
They kill.</i>

592
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,749
You mean the people
in the freighter office?

593
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,954
Just a minute.

594
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,758
Where do you think you're going?

595
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,150
I just came into town.
I gotta see Campbell.

596
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,153
Campbell's down at the hotel.
Hold it.

597
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,676
Hey, if you're a gunslinger,
how come you ain't wearing a gun?

598
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,991
- I lost it.
- Tell that to Campbell.

599
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,158
It's Howie. Fill that hotel with lead.

600
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,436
You're lucky you made it.

601
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,635
- What kind of a fool are you?
- I made it, didn't I?

602
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,472
What is this? What's going on?

603
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,119
Here, sit down here.

604
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,032
Let's have a look at it.

605
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,434
- Is it bad?
- No.

606
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,955
I can fix it.
Make a tourniquet out of the sleeve.

607
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,429
I'll get some water and bandages.

608
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,638
- I told you to stay where you were.
- I came here to get a gun.

609
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,109
- My father's, in his desk.
- You'll have to fight.

610
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,158
- Go relieve Henry Green.
- There's no water to wash the wound...

611
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,151
...but I found this whiskey.
- No water?

612
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,709
A bullet smashed the water cooler.

613
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,359
Bullets, fighting, killing.
It's not the answer to anything.

614
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,431
Just like that boy I killed
in the streets.

615
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,511
No older than Howie.
Why did he come here?

616
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,194
Why did he travel 1000 miles
just to come under my gun?

617
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,588
Maybe it was meant to be.

618
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,830
He could have become
another Campbell.

619
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,309
Why don't they come after us
if they're going to?

620
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,000
We need a drink.
I don't believe in bottled bravery...

621
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,754
...but this will tone us all up.

622
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,511
Howie, will you bring in
some wood for the stove?

623
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,119
Howie?

624
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,878
John.

625
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,308
Howie's out there.

626
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,516
Crazy fool.

627
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,998
Haven't you any sense at all?

628
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,038
We need water, don't we?
I got it.

629
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,919
If there's anything else you need,
just let me know.

630
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,789
That's the last water they'll get.

631
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,349
I think you're
the steadiest woman on earth.

632
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,112
Am I?

633
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,397
- You're trembling.
- Yes.

634
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,471
I'm gonna tell you again,
leave this house.

635
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,029
The situation is bad.
The showdown can come any time.

636
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,713
I know that.

637
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,077
For myself, I'm not sorry
for any of this.

638
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,879
But I am sorry that there
didn't seem to be time enough...

639
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,554
...for us to get to know each other
better in the past.

640
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,837
Are you, now? Has time run out?

641
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,831
I'm not a doddering old lady yet.

642
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,958
I suppose you've known it
all along...

643
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,270
...but the way I feel
toward you this moment...

644
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,477
...is no different than the way
I've always felt about you.

645
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,915
It's taken this,
seeing you at your best...

646
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,878
...to make me realize it
when it's too late.

647
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,396
John, if you're making love to me,
I'm not gonna let you sit there...

648
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,949
...and act as though it were
the end of our lives.

649
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,918
There are gonna be no goodbyes.
I'm not leaving this house...

650
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,798
...and that's that.
- You must.

651
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,430
If I'm to die, I want it all at once
and with you.

652
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,149
I'm not going anyplace else
to die in little pieces.

653
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,673
If there's any of that whiskey left,
you bring the bottle to me.

654
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,510
I'd like a sip to stop
the shaking in my knees.

655
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,598
I mean it about the bottle.
I really do.

656
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,671
I'll join you.

657
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,718
I want you to know, John,
you got no kick coming from me.

658
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,996
I've never wanted
anything more than I've had.

659
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,833
Only a chance to live my life
without being afraid.

660
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,230
I guess this is as good a way
as any to prove it.

661
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,197
Stewart! Everybody!

662
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,590
They're coming at us.
What are we gonna do?

663
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,948
Campbell's with them.
They've got a woman.

664
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,518
It's Marva.

665
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,398
I want to talk to Sheriff Gibbons.

666
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,159
Talk to me, Campbell.

667
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,673
Not you, Stewart.

668
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,115
I'll get you later,
and it won't be to gab.

669
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,317
You and your nephew murdered
two of my men, and you'll pay for it.

670
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,914
What about my brother, Campbell?
What about him?

671
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,233
I wouldn't know.
I understand he committed suicide.

672
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,311
If you're still alive, sheriff, speak up.

673
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,875
This is Gibbons.
What do you want?

674
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,873
I have no quarrel with anyone in there
except the Stewarts.

675
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,033
The rest of you come out,
I'll let you go free.

676
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,511
We've heard that before.

677
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,750
Well, listen to your daughter.

678
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,793
Please. Oh, Clyde, please.

679
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,155
Mr. Campbell means what he says.

680
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,917
Come out, you and father
and Corinne and the others.

681
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,116
You'll be safe.

682
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,277
Clyde, do you hear me?

683
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,431
Yes, I hear you.

684
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,030
We've got a right to live our lives.

685
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,035
Why should you give up yours
for something someone else did?

686
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,233
This isn't your fight.

687
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,992
Oh, Clyde.

688
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,479
Please.

689
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,394
Please think of us just once.

690
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,878
Why should we all be killed?

691
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,076
He started it. He said so.

692
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,757
Go, Clyde, if you wish.
You've done your share.

693
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,993
All right, what's the answer?

694
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,232
If you got any ideas you can
hold out till help comes, forget them.

695
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,152
The town's all sewed up.

696
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,039
We've gotta say yes.

697
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,071
What am I gonna do?

698
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,395
I won't hold it against any of you.

699
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,153
Go on, run out, all of you.

700
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,595
We Stewarts don't need you.

701
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,230
Have you lost your reason? Are you
trying to turn your man into a coward?

702
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,992
- He'll die.
- He's not dead yet.

703
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,549
- Nor are any of the others.
- Tell them to snap it up.

704
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,837
Marva, you can't be idiot enough
to believe that this man here...

705
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,274
...will keep his word.

706
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,318
He'll kill them all
if they come out of that house.

707
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,754
Get off the street.

708
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,148
Look at him.

709
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,676
They're here for one reason only.
To kill.

710
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,874
Don't come out, Clyde.

711
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,077
Campbell's lying.
He'll never keep his promise.

712
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,759
I was crazy to think so.

713
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,070
Put them in the hotel
and lock them up.

714
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,151
Women sure jinx you, Campbell.

715
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,637
Watch that window.

716
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,393
Dynamite.

717
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,551
Must've broken into
the freighter warehouse.

718
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,950
Try to pick off
who's throwing it, Tom.

719
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,950
- That was close.
- Too close for Baines.

720
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,393
Blowing us apart, room by room.

721
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,313
John, you haven't got a prayer
against that dynamite.

722
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,391
You're right.
We'll go out the back door...

723
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,154
...one at a time, so they won't
have a bunch to shoot at.

724
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,356
Maybe they figure
they got most of us by now.

725
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,478
It would help. We'll head for the river.
That's the only way.

726
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,349
First one out will have the best chance.
That's you, Clyde, with that wound.

727
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,150
- He's really botched it now.
- I'll go anyway.

728
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,069
I've got to take that chance.

729
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,910
Wait 10 seconds, Clyde.
Stay close to the well.

730
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,917
Come on, you killers.
Try and stop us. Try!

731
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,236
They're coming out the front way.

732
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,749
Dad covered for us.

733
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,433
It's only the old man.

734
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,113
Come on.

735
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,998
Come in, sheriff.

736
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,032
Ann.

737
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,919
- What happened?
- Campbell's blowing up the town.

738
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,799
They've gone kill-crazy.
Ride to the Stewart ranch for help.

739
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,191
Ride fast.
You can make it by sunup.

740
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,759
No, no, Stephen. Don't go.

741
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,036
It ain't our fight. Think of the family.

742
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,716
If Campbell finds out...
Oh, please, please. You can't.

743
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,673
- Six wins.
- Well, what do you know, I win again.

744
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,592
No, you were on four.

745
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,274
Oh, I say I was on six.

746
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,757
- How lucky can a guy get?
- All right, stop it!

747
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,190
Ain't you had enough, Scavo?

748
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,920
Well, we're just
celebrating a victory.

749
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,354
What victory?

750
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,829
You give me one old man
and two shopkeepers.

751
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,911
Where's John Stewart and the boy?

752
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,799
For the 10th time,
I told you I blew them out of the creek.

753
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,111
And you were well-paid for it.
1000 dollars gold for each of you.

754
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,875
You been eating my food and drinking
my whiskey till it runs out of your ears.

755
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,999
- You forgot our travel expenses.
- Not another cent.

756
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,990
Bring in the safe, boys.

757
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,198
Hold it!

758
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,232
Take his gun.

759
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,279
All right.

760
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,590
You're overplaying
your hand, Scavo.

761
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,433
Yeah? Go on.

762
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,071
Open her up, Mr. Campbell.

763
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,958
Open it.

764
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:57,789
We'll let you see how fair and even
we divide the money among us...

765
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,110
...so you'll know
we're not cheating you.

766
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,677
On second thought, we'll split it later.
You know we'll be honest.

767
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,195
All right, you got what you want.

768
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,476
Now I don't need you.
I don't need any of you.

769
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:15,633
I can get 50 men better than you.
So get out of my town.

770
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,438
Your town?

771
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,313
Ain't you heard?

772
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,277
This is our town.

773
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,672
Come on, boys,
we're drinking on Mr. Campbell.

774
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,836
<i>Señor Campbell.</i>

775
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,675
I have looked for her,
like you paid me.

776
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,400
- I have found her.
- Maria? Where is she?

777
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,677
<i>She is now at the ranchita
of Don Miguel.</i>

778
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,237
- Maria, you must talk to me.
- There is nothing to say.

779
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,630
Do not come near me.
You have killed.

780
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,473
Only because of you.
Because of you and John Stewart.

781
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,358
It is not true. You wanted power.

782
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,670
No. Only you.

783
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:33,230
Thinking about you
has made me crazy.

784
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,718
I would pray that I were ugly...

785
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,916
...so that you would never
look at me again.

786
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,198
No, Maria. You and I
will always be together.

787
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,749
They're looting Ocatilla,
but it doesn't matter.

788
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,156
We'll rebuild it. We'll start over.

789
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,151
No. No!

790
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,312
You're the only thing I ever wanted.

791
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,038
Campbell!

792
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,555
You saved me the trouble
of finding you.

793
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,959
- I'm unarmed.
- There's an accounting to be made.

794
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,198
My brother, the others and Howie.

795
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,193
You'll be unhappy to know
he's going to live, thanks to Maria.

796
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,317
No. No, I'm glad.

797
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,833
I made a mistake.

798
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,031
You... You'll give me a chance?
You'll be that fair?

799
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,711
I'm walking out of that door for a
minute, then I'm gonna walk back in.

800
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,472
One of your men
did that to Howie.

801
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,916
Find yourself a gun,
and when I come in, use it.

802
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,555
You! You had a gun.
The fine gun that I gave you.

803
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,994
- Where is it?
- I do not know.

804
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,479
- Where is it?!
- I do not know!

805
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,119
Liar!

806
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,796
No! No, I haven't got a gun!

807
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,038
I have two.

808
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,760
This one belonged
to my brother Adam.

809
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,751
Take mine. It's loaded.

810
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,072
Either you ride to the
marshal's office with me in Tucson...

811
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,356
...or pick it up and use it.

812
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,156
You watch out for Howie,
Maria, I'm going to town.

813
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,195
Haven't they done enough damage?

814
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,038
Marva.

815
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,753
It's John.

816
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,957
Corinne. Marva.

817
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,793
- Corinne. Marva.
- John.

818
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,468
Stick around, Stewart.

819
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,430
You trying to wreck
my organization, Stewart?

820
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:03,592
I have wrecked it. Campbell's dead,
and the others have gone.

821
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,108
Except for me.

822
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,039
Except for you.

823
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,154
Unbuckle your gun belt.
Toss it down.

824
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,310
Them two gals I got locked upstairs
should make my ride to the border...

825
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:20,156
...real pleasant. Especially that
pretty gal of yours, Corinne.

826
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,313
Get up.

827
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,198
It's on this time to stay, Clyde.

828
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,193
And I hope you find your old job
very dull from now on.

829
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,952
- I hope so, John.
- Goodbye.

830
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,633
Goodbye.

831
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,871
<i>Goodbye, Padre.
You did a first-rate job.</i>

832
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,519
Thank you, John.

833
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,432
Haven't you forgotten
something, Howie?

01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,149

For you, sir. It was a nice wedding.

835
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,153
I don't think it's quite enough

836
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,312
There you are.
Goodbye, everybody.

837
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,270
- Ready, Mrs. Stewart?
- Ready, Mr. Stewart.
