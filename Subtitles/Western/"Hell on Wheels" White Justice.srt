a whole lot more to those men

Just enough to buy a plot

Five sons, a daughter, two dogs, eight
hens, a couple of cats, and a canary.

523
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:06,485
I liked you better quiet.

524
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,893
Fong ready for work.

525
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:25,230
- Get to it then.
- Mmm.

526
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,976
Mr. Bohannon, from Stanford.

527
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:44,593
All right.

528
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:48,163
I'll talk to him.

529
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:57,036
There won't be a trial.
That'd be a waste of time.

530
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:02,741
And they wouldn't be convicted, 'cause
the only witnesses is you and Tao.

531
00:43:03,776 --> 00:43:07,878
And Chinamen ain't allowed to testify
against white men under California law.

532
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:13,986
So this is America.

533
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,853
(ABACUS BEAD CLACKING)

534
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:19,491
It may be the law, Mr. Bohannon,
but it is not justice.

535
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,059
No, it ain't.

536
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,667
Them men will leave Truckee,

537
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,238
and you're gonna let 'em.

538
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:34,076
Do we understand each another?

539
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,312
I think we understand each other very well.
