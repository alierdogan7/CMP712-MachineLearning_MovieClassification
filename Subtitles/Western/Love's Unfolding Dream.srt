before I had to take care
of the younger kids.

131
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,817
The fact is, I can only read
a few words in this paper.

132
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:27,790
So it's not that you won't help him,
it's just that you can't.

- What about your husband?
- He can't read at all.

extra time with Caleb.

George has hired him part-time at
the general store. He does other odd jobs.

151
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,647
Mostly he wants to
get a farm for himself.

152
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:34,350
- How did you get all that out of him?
- I asked him.

153
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,325
He doesn't seem very talkative to me.

154
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:38,827
Well, generally, when the sheriff
asks questions people give answers.

If Mrs. Kent would learn to read...

156
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:43,833
a whole new world would open up for her,
just like it did for me, Mama.

157
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,664
She'd become a different person.

158

Maybe that's what
her husband is afraid of.

00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:07,483
- Is there a doctor in town?
- Yes. Are you hurt?

165
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:11,722
No, not me. My employer, Mrs. Stafford-Smith,
has grown gravely ill.

166
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:15,094
<i>We were on the stagecoach passing through</i>
<i>when Mrs. Stafford-Smith became ill.</i>

167
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:18,396
- <i>I fear for her life.</i>
- <i>I didn't think she'd make it, Miss.</i>

168
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:21,199
- How long has she been like this?
- An hour or so, Miss.

169
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:27,106
Whoa. Whoa.

170
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:29,805
Doc, I got a patient for you.

171
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:38,120
All right, bring her
over here on the table.

172
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:40,179
<i>Put her right here.</i>

173
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,992
Put her right-That's it.
All right. All right.

174
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,996
Watch her head.

175
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,998
Watch her head.
All right.

176
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

177
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:55,471
Her breathing is fine. Pulse is steady.
Her skin's clammy to the touch, Doc.

178
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,404
<i>Mrs. Stafford-Smith</i>
<i>began slurring her words.</i>

179
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,305
Her sentences didn't make sense.
Then she collapsed.

180
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,936
- She been drinking?
- Of course not!

181
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:06,244
<i>Mrs. Stafford-Smith has</i>
<i>an occasional glass of sherry, but she is a lady!</i>

182
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:09,912
- How long y'all been traveling?
- We left Beacon Hill nearly two weeks ago.

183
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:12,820
- What's she doing out here?
- Visiting friends in Denver.

184
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,825
- The Montgomerys. A very prominent family.
- Do you think she had a stroke?

185
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:19,260
- Why would you say that?
- I read about the symptoms in <i>Gray's Anatomy.</i>

186
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,426
- Can you help her, Doctor?
- Unfortunately, I have another patient.

187
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,764
Possibly a breach birth.

188
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,770
But you can't leave
Mrs. Stafford-Smith!

189
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:30,602
<i>Well, there's nothing I can do for her</i>
<i>until she comes to.</i>

190
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,608
And she seems fairly stable.

191
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:35,008
There's only one of me.

192
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,516
<i>My other patient's situation is urgent,</i>
<i>so just watch out for her until I get back.</i>

193
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:43,110
- I'll stay, Doc.
- Well, I don't have much choice, do I?

194
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:46,156
All right, just make sure
she's comfortable...

195
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,157
and keep a close eye on her.

196
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:51,683
I'll get back as soon as I can.

197
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,378
Mrs. Tyler?

198
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:12,142
Hi, Sadie.
I just wanted to talk to you about-

199
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:15,208
- My boy in trouble at school?
- Oh, no.

200
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,048
Nothing like that.

201
00:12:17,121 --> 00:12:20,056
I stopped to bring some books for Mrs. Kent
I thought she might be interested in.

202
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:21,819
- You ask her for books?
- No.

203
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:24,725
No, she didn't.
I-I thought that-

204
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,730
Well, you thought wrong.
She got no use for books here.

205
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:30,494
<i>Now if you got a job you're offering,</i>
<i>that's a different story.</i>

206
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,899
No, I'm afraid not.

207
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,541
Dr. Jackson, she's awake!

208
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,483
H-Heaven's day-

209
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:51,043
- Get up. Get up.
- <i>[Groaning]</i>

210
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:55,057
<i>Mrs. Stafford-Smith,</i>
<i>my name is Dr. Jackson...</i>

211
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:58,060
and I believe you've had a stroke.

212
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:02,428
My photos- coach- bags-

213
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:06,060
Calm down. Calm down.
This is not good for you, ma'am.

214
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:09,435
Have-All that's left-

215
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,337
I have your bag right here.

216
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,070
All your things are inside.

217
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:17,136
[Sighs]

218
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,408
Her speech
has obviously been impaired.

219
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:23,578
Well, I don't think it's as bad
as it could have been.

220
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:27,090
<i>Hopefully the slurring will</i>
<i>diminish pretty quickly...</i>

221
00:13:27,157 --> 00:13:29,591
<i>and she'll regain coherent speech.</i>

222
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,094
There's some paralysis
on her right side...

223
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:34,096
but her left side seems unaffected.

224
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:37,531
As soon as she's well enough,
I could help her do some movement therapy.

225
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,536
I read they're having
good results with that.

226
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:43,038
Well, she will need
someone with her constantly...

227
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:45,473
till we get a better grasp
of her physical limitations.

228
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,601
I won't leave her side, Doctor.

229
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:52,445
It should be someone with at least
rudimentary medical knowledge.

230
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:54,450
[Sighs]
Belinda-

231
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:56,452
I can do it!

232
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,921
I don't want you to misinterpret this
as a permanent job offer, young lady.

233
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,619
- I haven't changed my mind
about women in medicine.
- So I'd be like your assistant?

234
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,628
Not exactly.

235
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:07,630
You will help Mrs. Stafford-Smith...

236
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:09,632
with her movement therapy.

237
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,828
- That is all.
- I accept.

238
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,655
<i>Well, good morning.</i>

239
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:34,884
Something I can do for you, son?

240
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,485
Uh, well, yes, I've got this problem.

241
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:42,521
- Mm-hmm.
- A carbuncle that is driving me crazy.

242
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:46,194
And you see,
the area that's affected...

243
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,398
has been getting a good deal of sitting time,
if you know what I mean.

244
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:53,136
Oh. You're trying to tell me
you've got a boil on your backside.

245
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:58,204
<i>Well, bend over the table,</i>
<i>drop your drawers and we'll have a look.</i>

246
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:11,294
Oh! That is a mean-looking carbuncle
you got there, all right.

247
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:15,195
Uh, would you bring me
some of that rider's liniment.

248
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:18,029
It's on the top shelf in there.

249
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:20,037
Would you stop rubbing!

250
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:24,073
- I can't help it.
- Well, the more you scratch it, the itchier it gets.

251
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,109
Here you go, Doc.

252
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,645
Oh! Hey, now. Whoa!

253
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:31,146
- Wait. Never mind.
- Well-

254
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:34,184
- W-What about your carbuncle?
- What carbuncle?

255
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,846
<i>Well, at least take the liniment.</i>
<i>Belinda!</i>

256
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,017
Doctor.

257
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:45,959
[Giggling]

258
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,261
You see, that's another reason
I can't hire a woman.

259
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:53,531
How am I going to make my money
with you scaring away my patients?

260
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,442
Well, what do you think?

261
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:03,446
Let me get this straight.

262
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:06,449
You want to hire Sadie
to help you at school...

263
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:09,042
so you can teach her to read
without her husband knowing?

264
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:12,520
- It's an ingenious plan, if you ask me.
- What will you have her do?

265
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,686
Whatever needs to be done. Sweep the floors,
clean blackboards, keep the wood stove burning.

266
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,321
Simple things that allow her to
learn along with the children.

267
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,662
Don't you think the way you're
going about this is just a little sneaky?

268
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,669
I think the Lord
will forgive my methods...

269
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:30,537
if I can offer this poor woman
a path out of the darkness of ignorance.

270
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:39,740
<i>Lindy, how long is Doc gonna</i>
<i>let you stay on at the clinic?</i>

271
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,251
As long as Mrs. Stafford-Smith
needs me.

272
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:45,254
After that Doc says I get the boot.

273
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:49,656
You will prove yourself so indispensable
that he will never want to let you go.

274
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:51,718
That's the idea.

275
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:57,033
Grandma, there's one too many
plates for the table.

276
00:16:57,101 --> 00:17:00,036
We have a guest
joining us for supper.

277
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,732
Come on in, young man.
Let me introduce you.

278
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:04,740
This is my wife Marty.

279
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

280
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,608
- My daughter Missie.
- How do you do?

281
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,547
And this is my granddaughter Belinda.
Lindy, this is Mr. Drew Simpson.

282
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,779
<i>He inherited Hank's place, and he's</i>
<i>come all the way from New York City.</i>

283
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:18,583
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Simpson.

284
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:21,250
I trust your journey here hasn't left you
suffering any adverse affects.

285
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:24,055
Nothing worth speaking of.

286
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:28,030
- We're all very interested
in hearing about your journey.
- I know I am.

287
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,362
- Yeah.
- We're having a simple dinner.

288
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,800
Fried chicken.
I hope you like it.

289
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,805
Lord, we thank you for the food
that's in front of us...

290
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,807
the family that surrounds us...

291
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,810
and the new friend
that's joined us at our table.

292
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,709
- Amen.
- Amen.

293
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,374
Ah-ah-ah!
Jacob, honey. Guests first.

294
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,383
Would you like a biscuit,
Mr. Simpson?

295
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:51,717
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry about your uncle.
He was a wonderful man.

296
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,054
Belinda spent quite a bit of time with him
in his last few weeks.

297
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,652
- She nursed him right to the very end.
- That was very kind of you.

298
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,663
Well, Lindy's a natural caretaker.

299
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,598
In fact, she's working
in town with Doc Jackson.

300
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,158
- I hope to be a doctor someday.
- Oh.

301
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:08,431
That's rather unusual, isn't it?

302
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,700
- Pardon me?
- A woman doctor.

303
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:13,766
- It doesn't seem quite appropriate.
- Appropriate?

304
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:18,781
Why would a lady want to subject herself to such
a mentally and physically taxing line of work?

305
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,749
Oh, boy.

306
00:18:20,818 --> 00:18:23,446
I would think being from New York City you
would have a more enlightened view of women.

307
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,455
And by enlightened I assume you mean
a view that agrees with yours.

308
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,617
<i>Ladies are as capable</i>
<i>of practicing medicine as men are.</i>

309
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,093
<i>I could recommend several</i>
<i>newspaper articles for you to read.</i>

310
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:34,289
That is, if you're open
to being educated.

311
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:37,300
I think you'll find the majority of men
uncomfortable...

312
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:40,132
being tended to
by someone of the weaker sex.

313
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:44,664
<i>That's true. Some men might be so intimidated</i>
<i>that they run away in embarrassment.</i>

314
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:47,540
I'm just saying that,
like most men...

315
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,943
when I marry
I'll need my wife at home.

316
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,949
She'll have enough to do
just taking care of me and our children.

317
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:55,042
- I'm sure she will.
- More potatoes, anyone?

318
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,280
- Yes.
- <i>Please!</i>

319
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:07,262
You're awake. Good.

320
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,526
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith?

321
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,397
Tired.

322
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,673
Here.

323
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,575
No!
Don't need help.

324
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:25,206
- Your speech is better today.
- But not my arm.

325
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:29,218
With movement therapy it's possible
to regain the use of your arm. Like this.

326
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,220
Don't touch me.

You're awake, madam.
This is wonderful!

329
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:42,858
- Don't fuss over me, Windsor.
- Sorry, madam.

330
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,868
- We should let her get some rest.
- Of course, Miss.

331
00:19:45,936 --> 00:19:49,667
I'll be in the next room, Madam.
I won't leave you.

332
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,174
I know you won't, Windsor.

333
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:01,450
<i>I'd be at a great disadvantage...</i>

334
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:05,045
if you hadn't been available
to help me fix up the place, Mr. Davis.

335
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:08,057
I'd never have got it
good enough to sell.

336
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,389
Glad to do it.

337
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:14,022
- <i>You be careful now you don't</i>
<i>catch yourself on a rusty-</i>
- Ow!

338
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:16,032
Wire. Hold on.

339
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,628
- Let me take a look at it. Let me see it.
- Naw, it's nothing.

340
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,371
Yeah, that puncture wound is deep.

341
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:28,070
I'll tell you, one thing you don't
mess around with is rusty wire.

342
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,238
You'll get a nasty infection.

343
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,805
I want you to go into town,
see the doc.

344
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:36,876
- I'm fine, really.
- Go on now. You don't mess with rust in a cut.

345
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:38,888
- I'll finish up here.
- Yes, sir.

346
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:40,947
All right.

347
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:44,217

00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:07,841
Afternoon, Mr. Simpson.

351
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:12,082
Good afternoon, Miss Tyler.
I came to see Doctor Jackson about my hand.

352
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:15,853
He's out checking on patients.
Why? What's wrong?

353
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,860
A little run-in with a rusty wire.

354
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:20,624
- When do you expect the doc to return?
- Not for hours.

355
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:24,033
Rusty wire?

356
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,501
Tetanus can take hold pretty quick.

357
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,767
- Might end up losing the hand.
- I think you're exaggerating.

358
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,866
I understand that you're uncomfortable
being tended to by the weaker sex...

359
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:35,878
but unless we clean that wound immediately
it might be too late.

360
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:37,880
Lockjaw could set in by tonight.

361
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:41,384
Although that may
not be the worst thing.

362
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:43,214
All right.

363
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:46,222
How much humble pie do I have to eat
to persuade you to help me?

364
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,387
Enough to make me believe you sincerely regret
saying I have no business becoming a doctor.

365
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:53,861
[Sighs]
I most sincerely regret it.

366
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,865
Come inside.

367
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,737
My grandpa tells me
you went to Columbia University.

368
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:05,741
You didn't mention that
the other day at dinner.

369
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:07,743
I guess I could have worked that in...

370
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:10,746
when you offered to recommend articles
to help enlighten me.

371
00:22:10,814 --> 00:22:12,748
That would have been a good time.

372
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:15,683
You're so fortunate to have
the opportunity to study at Columbia.

373
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:19,518
- I suppose that's true.
- I can't be a doctor without the proper education.

374
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,185
Most hospitals won't even consider me
for a nursing position.

375
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,229
The proper education requires
a great deal of money.

376
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:28,355
I've been saving for a long time.

377
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,094
- [Hisses]
- I'm sorry if it stings.

No, no, it's all right.

379
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:35,664
Actually, you've been very gentle.

380
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,267
There.
You're all set.

381
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:44,980
Remember to keep the wound cleaned.

382
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:49,951
At the risk of bringing up an old argument,
you're a bright and beautiful young woman-

383
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,045
- Beautiful?
- Yes.

Anyway, you'll surely
be married before long.

386
00:22:56,193 --> 00:23:00,061
Why would you want to waste your time
preparing for a career that you'll have to leave?

387
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,998
Why does every man assume
that I'm on a hunt for a husband?

388
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,127
Isn't that the goal?
Find a mate, settle down, have children?

389
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:10,605
As a lawyer, everything
is black or white to you, isn't it?

390
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:13,438
Well, that's-
that's rather simplistic.

391
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,810
<i>But there is a clear-cut sense of right and wrong</i>
<i>in the law that I've come to appreciate.</i>

00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,815
That's why we're different.

00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,817
I see all of God's colors.

394
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:25,252
And somewhere between black and white
is my dream to be a doctor.

395
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:30,591
- I should get back to the ranch.
- Of course.

00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,652
Please tell my grandpa I said hello.

<i>And the draft in here practically</i>
<i>blows the blanket off my legs.</i>

401
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:00,121
How long until I can leave?

402
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,820
You can move to the hotel today,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith, if Belinda will stay with you.

403
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:08,092
- Can you do that?
- But I thought I'd continue to work here with you.

404
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,099
Mrs. Stafford-Smith needs a nurse.

405
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:13,694
- I thought that's what you wanted to be.
- Actually I want to be a doctor.

406
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,761
It's all settled then.

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,334
- Is everything all right?
- You forgot your lunch today.

00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:54,070
Oh, you are so sweet to bring it.
I am starving. Thank you.

414
00:24:56,246 --> 00:25:00,239
Saw Charles Kent this morning.
He told me Sadie really enjoys working here.

415
00:25:00,317 --> 00:25:03,184
She is learning
more and more every day.

416
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:07,212
She's already ahead of Caleb.
Now she can help him with his work.

417
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,088
I know how much you want to help Sadie,
but Charles is a proud man.

418
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,355
Pride is a man's downfall, Zach.

419
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,763
He won't take it too well if he finds out
she's doing something behind his back.

420
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,563

I'm afraid so, Madam.

I suppose it's a step up
from the clinic.

00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:37,384
Still, these pillows are much too flat.
They'll never do.

00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:45,859
I'm mortified by these

seeing the opera house?

00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:32,232
Or even a hat shop with

00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:35,176
No? I thought not.

00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:38,476
- Anderson Corner has other things to offer.
- Such as?

00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:41,949
Good people. And a church that
welcomes everybody, including strangers.

And we take care of each other

You've never even been
outside this small town, have you?

447
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:52,327
Actually I was born in New York.
I didn't come here until I was 14.

It must be awful lonely

When you've had a little experience

I'll turn out the light

00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:15,938
It must have been a very interesting book
to keep you awake at that hour.

Oh, it is. It's called <i>The Laws of Life,</i>

- I heard her speak in Boston.

489
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,981
<i>She's a very intelligent woman.</i>

490
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,314
I can't imagine what it must be like
to hear her speak in person.

491
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,445
You sound like you greatly admire her.

492
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,922
She's done so much to pave the way
for women to become doctors.

493
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:37,186
Ah. And that's
what you want to be.

494
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,196
I'll be fortunate if I'm able
to train to be a nurse.

495
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:44,233
The schooling for doctors
is terribly expensive.

496
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:55,868
- You moved your arm.
- Your powers of observation are remarkable.

497
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:58,140
This calls for a cup of tea.

498
00:29:58,214 --> 00:30:01,781
Now, imagine this is
your favorite Earl Grey.

499
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:03,712
See if you can lift your arm
enough to take it.

500
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:05,808
What, like a dog doing tricks?

501
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:07,750
Like a woman who wants
her independence back.

502
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,721
You are a very
impertinent young woman.

503
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,724
And you are a very difficult patient.

Oh, no, thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, Mrs. Tyler.

00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:11,212
Hello, boys.
What can I do for you?

514
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:14,447
- Mom needs some flour.
- All right. What kind?

515
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:17,420
- She usually has wheat.
- Wheat's good.

516
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:20,118
All right- Ow!

517
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:23,890
- You okay, Mr. Browne?
- [Groans Loudly]

518
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:27,626

George needs you

He's got a pain.
He can't even stand up straight.

- Well-

- <i>Yeah, I thought so.</i>
- Aah!

532
00:32:02,902 --> 00:32:05,871
I got to get back to the office.
If you need anything, let me know, Doc.

- Bye, Daddy.

Checking for rebound tenderness?

538
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:25,047
Well, if you're so smart,
what am I doing now?

539
00:32:25,124 --> 00:32:27,615
- Using McBurney's point method
to diagnose what's wrong.
- Aah!

540
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:30,060
- One twenty-five.
- And I suppose you have an opinion?

541
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:33,656
I think he has acute appendicitis.
He probably needs surgery.

542
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,667
If he has an appendicitis attack...

543
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:38,203
it's not bad enough
to warrant surgery.

544
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:40,671
- But if his appendix were to burst, Doctor-
- Burst?

545
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,674
J-J-Just calm down, George.

546
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:45,677
There's nothing to worry about now.

547
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:48,270
- You can get up.
- All right.

548
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:53,683
Look, if you get a fever
or if the pain gets considerably worse...

00:32:53,753 --> 00:32:57,280
you come and see me,
even if it's in the middle of the night.

550

You take a teaspoon of this three times a day
till the pain goes away.

551

And, George,
you stay out of that candy jar.

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,099
- You're a grown man, not a five-year-old.
- Yes, sir.

- Much obliged.

00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:22,908
Now listen here, young lady.

556
00:33:22,982 --> 00:33:27,112
A good doctor never performs
an unnecessary surgery.

557
00:33:27,186 --> 00:33:30,451
It's too risky,
unless the patient will die without it.

558
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:32,457
But he had all the symptoms.

559
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,857
If he had acute appendicitis...

560
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:37,794
George would have been

- When did you first know you loved her?
- That's easy.

<i>When I thought</i>
<i>I'd never see her again.</i>

578
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:02,941
I felt a terrible emptiness inside of me.

579

And I knew that if I didn't get her back,
nothing would ever fill that up again.

580
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:10,855
That's a pretty clear sign.

581
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:12,914
I thought so.

00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:15,960

- No.

school before getting serious about anybody.

00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,732
- He may be right.
- He's always right.

587
00:35:27,807 --> 00:35:31,243
Sounds like a man
who's pretty sure of himself.

588
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,746
If he's ever had a moment's doubt,
he hasn't admitted it.

589
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:37,374
- Considers it a weakness, I'll bet.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

590
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:41,682
He says if someone senses weakness in you,
that's when they go in for the kill.

591
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:44,188
That's a pretty harsh way
to look at life.

to taking her abuse, but I'm not about to.

620
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:02,288
Mrs. Stafford-Smith would never

I don't know what you call it back East, but here

This is Benjamin and Lucy,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith's children.

- I thought she didn't have any children.
- She doesn't now.

Oh, I see.

627
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:25,984
Mrs. Stafford-Smith became a widower
shortly after Lucy was born.

Her children became everything

When Mrs. Stafford-Smith lost Lucy...

634

the only thing that
kept her going was Benjamin.

635
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:47,531

I'm so sorry.

637
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:53,169
That explains her anger and bitterness,
but that doesn't excuse her behavior.

638
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:57,443
I just want you to understand that Mrs.
Stafford-Smith was not always the way she is.

She was a kind and generous woman.

00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:04,083
Try to think of her the way she was,
before unbearable loss changed her.

641
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:11,562
Try to see her with a forgiving heart

This submissive demeanor

00:39:53,272 --> 00:39:56,730
Does it have anything to do
with Windsor rushing out after you?

650
00:39:56,809 --> 00:40:00,336
He told me a little bit about your background,
but please do not be angry with him.

He's devoted to you.

653
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:08,112
<i>The only reason he told me</i>
<i>is because he believes you need me.</i>

654
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:10,121
I don't need anyone to help me.

655
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:12,657
We all need someone.

656
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:17,655
I lost my mother, father
and baby sister.

657
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,166
When I was nine my little brother Jacob and I
had to go live in an orphanage.

658
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:24,168
- How did you get here?
- An orphan train.

659
00:40:24,236 --> 00:40:28,070
They go from town to town
giving kids to whoever want them.

660
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,109
Sometimes they're good families
and sometimes they're not.

661
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:34,772
If it wasn't for Missie and Zach,
me and Jacob would be separated forever.

662
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:37,543
I'm sorry for you, Belinda.

663
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:40,551
But now you know
why I turned from God.

664
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,783
- No, I don't.
- How can you still have faith?

665
00:40:44,857 --> 00:40:46,791
I know we never really die.

666
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,522
I'm connected to the people I love in life,
and I know we're still connected in death.

667
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:55,397
A comforting thought if you
can believe in fairy tales, which I can't.

668
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:01,136
That's enough for today.
You may go.

669
00:41:15,654 --> 00:41:17,645
Whoa.

670
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:30,761
- Hi!
- Belinda.

671
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,430
I was visiting my grandma
and she wanted me to bring lunch to y'all.

672
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:37,134
<i>Well, your grandpa went into town to pick up</i>
<i>some lumber. He should be back soon.</i>

673
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,507
I'll just leave this here then.

674
00:41:39,578 --> 00:41:43,514
Uh, wait. Why don't you stay
and visit a while.

675
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:46,608
I can't. I should be getting
back to the clinic.

676
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:51,384
Well, I was thinking that maybe, uh,
we could have lunch at the hotel sometime.

677
00:41:51,457 --> 00:41:54,858
- I'd like that.
- Tomorrow?

678
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:57,862
Well...

679
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,023
sure.

680
00:42:13,112 --> 00:42:16,275
<i>[Horse Whinnies]</i>

681
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:30,223
- Evening, Charles.
- Evening, Mr. Davis.

682
00:42:30,296 --> 00:42:34,926
Drew Simpson is fixing up his uncle's place.
He could use some help.

683
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,436
He'll pay you a good wage, and I thought
you might be interested in the job.

684
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:40,597
- Can I work around my hours at the store?
- You bet.

685
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:43,164
All right then.
I'll be there right after lunch.

686
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:45,574
- I'll see you then.
- All right.

687
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:47,805
Mr. Davis.

688
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,474
Thank you, sir.
I really appreciate the work.

689
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:53,017
You're welcome, Charles.
You're welcome.

690
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:10,425
Thank you.

691
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:13,494
[Groans]

692
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:18,934
I envy you your faith, Belinda,
but I can't share it.

693
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:21,946
And even if I could,
it doesn't change the fact...

694
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:24,949
that the only reason I didn't
let that stroke kill me...

695
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:28,453
is my distant relatives
who are just waiting for me to die...

696
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,988
so that they can inherit my fortune.

697
00:43:31,056 --> 00:43:35,720
I think the whole reason your stroke
didn't kill you is 'cause God has work for you.

698
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:39,195
- You find a purpose by loving other people.
- And losing them.

699
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:42,927
The fact that you grieve deeply
means you love deeply.

700
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:46,801
There are so many people out there
who need what you have.

701
00:43:46,872 --> 00:43:49,602
- Who would that be?
- At the orphanage...

702
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:54,305
there's hundreds of children without parents
or parents who simply give them away.

703
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,008
Ah, so you're suggesting I give money.

704
00:43:57,082 --> 00:43:59,482
Not just money.
Yourself.

705
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:02,884
<i>You have so much love to give</i>
<i>and they need love.</i>

706
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:09,356
Aren't we supposed to be practicing?

707
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:14,595
Reach for the teacup.

708
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,531
One hand.

709
00:44:28,747 --> 00:44:30,977
[Gasps]

710
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:44,619
Best cup of tea I ever had.

711
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:52,234
- <i>[Charles] Hold it right there.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

712
00:44:54,473 --> 00:44:56,407
- That'll do it.
- [Chuckles]

713
00:44:56,475 --> 00:45:00,104
Thanks again, Charles. I'm not sure
what I would have done without you.

714
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:02,477
You're more than welcome,
Mr. Simpson.

715
00:45:02,548 --> 00:45:04,482
Drew.

716
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,541
All right. Drew.

717
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:11,580
May I ask you a question?
About the law?

718
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:13,591
Sure.

719
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:15,593
It's about adoption.

720
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:17,405
You and your wife
thinking about adopting a child?

721
00:45:17,405 --> 00:45:18,463
You and your wife
thinking about adopting a child?

722
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,840
Well, not exactly.
Sadie was married before we met.

723
00:45:22,911 --> 00:45:26,642
And her first husband,
he was Caleb's pa.

724
00:45:26,714 --> 00:45:28,648
<i>But he was a real no-account.</i>

725
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:32,117
He used to beat Sadie and Caleb both.

726
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,212
- She divorce him?
- Yeah.

727
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:39,124
He got in a bar fight and he hurt some fella
real bad, and they put him prison.

728
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:43,221
Gave Sadie a chance to get away,
but he's fixing to get out soon.

729
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:47,098
And I know he's gonna
come looking for Caleb.

730
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:50,569
Now, if I can adopt him...

731
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:53,664
does that make him my boy,
and then ain't nobody can take him away?

732
00:45:53,741 --> 00:45:56,767
That's right.

733
00:45:56,844 --> 00:46:00,302
Sadie's awful worried that
he won't give up his claim to Caleb.

734
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:05,148
Well, under normal circumstances,
he'd have to agree to it.

735
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,484
But because he's been in prison...

736
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:10,615
there's no way the court
would favor him over you.

737
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:14,184
- You sure about that?
- Well, I'll draw up the papers to petition the court.

738
00:46:14,262 --> 00:46:16,196
We'll see what the judge has to say.

739
00:46:16,264 --> 00:46:20,360
- Well, now, I can't pay you right now, but-
- You don't have to.

740
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:25,566
- Well, I don't take charity.
- Consider it part of your wages for working here.

741
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,700
Like a- a bonus
for doing a really good job.

742
00:46:28,776 --> 00:46:32,007
All right.

743
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,073
- Thank you, Drew.
- It's my pleasure, Charles.

744
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,516
I just passed the bar.

745
00:46:38,586 --> 00:46:43,751
- When I return home,
I'll join my father's practice.
- Does he practice criminal law?

746
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:46,350
Nothing nearly so unsavory.

747
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:50,090
No, he handles mostly contracts,
wills, trusts, that sort of thing.

748
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:53,565
My father represents some
of the wealthiest people in New York.

749
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:55,626
So you'll only be helping the rich people.

750
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:59,696
- That's who our clients are.
- They don't have to be.
You could help the less fortunate.

751
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:01,765
We work with people
who pay our fees.

752
00:47:01,843 --> 00:47:04,368
- Is that all you care about- money?
- <i>[Chuckles]</i>

753
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:06,436
Don't be ridiculous.
That's not what I meant.

754
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:09,540
It seems to me you don't
have a real passion for law.

755
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:14,111
Well, the definition of law
is reason free from passion.

756
00:47:15,723 --> 00:47:17,953
Do you have time to take a walk?

757
00:47:18,026 --> 00:47:21,223
- I should be getting back to Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
- A short one?

758
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:37,141
So, do you really want to be a lawyer,
or was it simply expected of you?

759
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:40,772
It was always understood that I would
follow in my father's footsteps, yes.

760
00:47:40,848 --> 00:47:44,215
What does your mother think?
Or doesn't her opinion matter?

761
00:47:44,285 --> 00:47:47,550
Oh, her opinion would matter
a great deal if she were still alive.

762
00:47:47,622 --> 00:47:52,116
- She died when I was eight.
- Oh, I had no idea. I'm so sorry, Drew.

763
00:47:52,193 --> 00:47:54,127
You know,
for a long time after she died...

764
00:47:54,195 --> 00:47:56,857
I used to play this little game
every time I left the house.

765
00:47:56,931 --> 00:48:00,196
<i>I'd pretend that when I came home,</i>
<i>she'd be there...</i>

766
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:02,930
hidin' somewhere waiting
for me to find her. [Chuckles]

767
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:07,100
<i>Of course the only thing I ever found was</i>
<i>the latest governess my father had hired.</i>

768
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:12,374
<i>He gave me every material advantage</i>
<i>I could ever hope for.</i>

769
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:16,144
The only thing I ever wanted was my mother
to be there when I came home.

770
00:48:16,217 --> 00:48:19,653
- You're privileged to have both your parents.
- Actually, I was adopted.

771
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:23,282
I would have never guessed
they're not really your family.

772
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,384
- I mean, not that-
- [Laughs] It's all right.

773
00:48:26,461 --> 00:48:29,294
At first I didn't feel like
they were my family.

774
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:33,095
They made me realize that loving someone
has nothing to do with being related...

775
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,635
and everything to do with opening your heart
and letting someone in.

776
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:38,467
I envy the relationship
you have with your family.

777
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:41,736
- Why?
- You really love each other.

778
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:44,607
I haven't felt that
since my mother died.

779
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,842
That sense of security of knowing-

780
00:48:47,915 --> 00:48:50,975
Knowing that someone'll
always be there for you.

781
00:48:51,052 --> 00:48:54,180
You'll never be completely
on your own again.

782
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:56,246
Yes.

783
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,991
Exactly.

784
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:09,431
You see?
[Chuckles]

785
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:12,803
[Chuckles]
My, my, my...

786
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:17,106
you have made remarkable progress,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.

787
00:49:17,178 --> 00:49:19,874
I must say, I am very impressed.

788
00:49:19,947 --> 00:49:24,884
<i>To be truthful, I wasn't sure</i>
<i>you'd regain use of your arm.</i>

789
00:49:24,952 --> 00:49:29,082
Nor did I think so, but Belinda
was stubborn about my therapy.

790
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:32,126
<i>She listened to me</i>
<i>grouse and complain...</i>

791
00:49:32,193 --> 00:49:34,627
but she never gave up on me.

792
00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:38,256
She's a remarkable young woman,
don't you think, Doctor?

793
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:42,098
Yes.
Yes, she is, indeed.

794
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,070
<i>Remarkable.</i>
<i>[Chuckles]</i>

795
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:46,834
I know you must be anxious
to get back to Boston...

796
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:50,241
and I think you can start
planning to go home now.

797
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:53,940
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

798
00:49:55,983 --> 00:49:59,419
<i>So, what did you ride all the way out here</i>
<i>to ask your grandma?</i>

799
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:03,150
It seems while I wasn't looking,
my life just got really complicated.

800
00:50:03,224 --> 00:50:06,455
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Drew Simpson, would it?

801
00:50:06,527 --> 00:50:09,052
I'm attracted to him and it's not fair.

802
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,462
- To you or to him?
- <i>Both.</i>

803
00:50:11,532 --> 00:50:14,126
He's becoming a distraction.
I can't let that happen.

804
00:50:14,202 --> 00:50:17,968
<i>Everything seems to be getting</i>
<i>a lot harder all of a sudden.</i>

805
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:21,406
Only a few years ago I knew
just how to get answers to my questions.

806
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,138
You wish it was simple again
like when you were a child?

807
00:50:24,212 --> 00:50:27,613
You could say a heartfelt prayer to God
and then just listen for his guidance.

808
00:50:27,682 --> 00:50:29,912
Yes.

809
00:50:29,984 --> 00:50:32,919
Belinda, it's still that simple.

810
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:43,763
Drew, you wanna take a break?

811
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:47,665
What? Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.
[Chuckles]

812
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:55,167
- Somethin' weighin' on your mind?
- No, nothing.

813
00:50:57,011 --> 00:51:01,277
Have you ever had that experience
where you think a person is one way...

814
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,214
and they turn out
to be something else entirely?

815
00:51:03,284 --> 00:51:05,718
I think we've all had that experience
at one time-

816
00:51:05,786 --> 00:51:08,687
I had Belinda all figured out.
Then I get thrown for a loop.

817
00:51:08,756 --> 00:51:14,023
- And that's bad?
- Well, it's... complicated.

818
00:51:14,095 --> 00:51:17,622
- She makes me think about things
I thought were all settled.
- Such as?

819
00:51:17,698 --> 00:51:19,893
Where I'm going to live,
what I'm going to do.

820
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:22,993
Even whether or not my life
has any real meaning or purpose.

821
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,471
Well, a woman can do that to a man.

822
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,237
I know what I want to do with my life.

823
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,972
I want to sell this place,
go back to New York...

824
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:34,708
<i>go into my father's firm,</i>
<i>get married, and raise a family.</i>

825
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:38,946
- Well, in that case, what is the problem?
- Belinda is the problem.

826
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,784
I don't want to think about her.
I don't want to get involved with her.

827
00:51:41,856 --> 00:51:44,950
She's nothing like the kind of woman
I have planned for my future.

828
00:51:45,026 --> 00:51:48,359
<i>She wants a career...</i>
<i>in a man's field!</i>

829
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:51,159
She's opinionated...

830
00:51:51,232 --> 00:51:53,757
outspoken, strong-willed...

831
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:57,167
smart, kind.

832
00:51:57,238 --> 00:52:00,605
That doesn't sound like a problem, son.
That sounds like an opportunity.

833
00:52:05,146 --> 00:52:07,137
Whoa.

834
00:52:22,697 --> 00:52:25,530
Oh, it's not your hand again.

835
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,034
It's my finger.
I think it's broken.

836
00:52:28,102 --> 00:52:32,266
[Exhales] There ought to be
a law against giving you a hammer, son.

837
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:38,601
For your information, the first time
I hurt myself, it was on a wire.

838
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:43,139
Maybe you should stick
to lawyering. Hmm.

839
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,787
Belinda, why don't you, uh,
look at the boy's hand.

840
00:52:56,597 --> 00:52:58,565
Can you bend it?

841
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:02,225
I guess I can.

842
00:53:04,205 --> 00:53:07,470
I think it's just a bruise.
I could splint it if it's broken.

843
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:10,169
It might be quite cumbersome.

844
00:53:10,244 --> 00:53:13,042
Just leave it.

845
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:16,550
Have lunch at the hotel
with me today.

846
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:18,915
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- Tomorrow then?

847
00:53:18,986 --> 00:53:21,079
I have Mrs. Stafford-Smith to tend to.

848
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:25,424
- Well, maybe we could find time-
- Do you want the splint?

849
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:30,362
What? No. No splint.

850
00:53:30,431 --> 00:53:33,594
Then excuse me.
I have work to finish.

851
00:54:03,764 --> 00:54:05,561
Belinda, wait.

852
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:08,193
I have to get home, Drew.
I have things to do.

853
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:10,794
Why are you being like this?
What happened?

854
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:13,066
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

855
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,303
When the farm sells,
you'll be moving back to New York, right?

856
00:54:16,377 --> 00:54:18,504
Well, yes.

857
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,980
And I'll be staying here.
So where does that leave us?

858
00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:26,952
<i>You'll go back to a life</i>
<i>I can barely imagine.</i>

859
00:54:27,021 --> 00:54:29,319
Meeting with rich clients
in a big office...

860
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,915
<i>going to fancy balls with orchestras...</i>

861
00:54:31,992 --> 00:54:36,122
dancing with well-bred girls
in satin gowns.

862
00:54:36,197 --> 00:54:38,563
After a while,
you won't even remember me.

863
00:54:40,334 --> 00:54:43,201
Hand me that, please.

864
00:54:50,711 --> 00:54:53,202
- Come on, Drifter.

866
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,819
Well, let's see who that is.

867
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:11,922
- Hey, Charles.
- Evening, Sheriff. Awful sorry
to interrupt your family meal.

868
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:14,024
Would you like to join us, Charles?

869
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:19,129
Oh, no, thank you, ma'am. I just came
to drop this by. It's for Miss Belinda.

870
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:28,148
It seems Drew hurt himself again.

871
00:55:28,215 --> 00:55:32,584
I better go check on him.
I'll be back as soon as I can, Mama.

872
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:36,212
- Thank you, Charles.
- Sheriff.

873
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,225
<i>[Hoofbeats Pounding]</i>

874
00:55:56,043 --> 00:55:58,034
Drew?

875
00:56:04,985 --> 00:56:08,250
What?

876
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:11,416
- I believe this belonged to my aunt.
- ## [Music Box]

877
00:56:11,492 --> 00:56:14,984
Probably meant
a great deal to my uncle.

878
00:56:16,363 --> 00:56:18,923
[Sighs]
This isn't a fancy ballroom.

879
00:56:18,999 --> 00:56:21,092
There isn't an orchestra.

880
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:26,329
<i>## [Continues]</i>

881
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:30,634
But if I can have this dance...

882
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:33,612
I promise you, Belinda,
that I will never forget it.

883
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,413
You know this doesn't
change anything, Drew.

884
00:57:14,488 --> 00:57:18,584
- I think it changes everything.
- I should go in.

885
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:20,524
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

886
00:57:21,662 --> 00:57:23,653
- I don't think-
- Tomorrow.

887
00:57:28,836 --> 00:57:30,770
[Man]
Hyah!

888
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:34,797
<i>Dr. Jackson has given me the go-ahead</i>
<i>to travel home to Boston.</i>

889
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:39,175
I'm very happy for you, Mrs. Stafford-Smith,
but I am gonna miss you.

890
00:57:39,246 --> 00:57:41,237
I'd like you to come with me, Belinda.

891
00:57:41,315 --> 00:57:44,079
If you're worried about
the travel, Mister-

892
00:57:44,151 --> 00:57:47,018
No, I'm not looking
for a traveling companion.

893
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:49,521
I'd like you to come back
to Boston and live with me.

894
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:53,117
Take me to that orphanage.
I'd like to meet those children.

895
00:57:53,193 --> 00:57:56,754
You don't need me to take you there.
I'll just get you the name of the orphanage.

896
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,764
No.
Well, Belinda, there's more.

897
00:57:58,832 --> 00:58:02,199
I would like to pay your way
through college and medical school.

898
00:58:02,269 --> 00:58:06,729
<i>You shouldn't have to settle</i>
<i>for small dreams.</i>

899
00:58:06,807 --> 00:58:11,301
<i>Dare to go for the big ones!</i>
<i>You'll make a fine doctor, Belinda.</i>

900
00:58:11,378 --> 00:58:14,779
That's a much too generous offer,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.

901
00:58:14,848 --> 00:58:17,578
<i>I'm afraid I can't accept it.</i>

902
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:22,054
- Why on earth not?
- Because it would take me years
and years to pay you back.

903
00:58:22,122 --> 00:58:24,989
Well, it's not a loan, it's a gift.

904
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:29,120
I'm a very wealthy woman.
I can afford to do this for you.

905
00:58:29,196 --> 00:58:34,463
I would like to think,
if my Lucy had lived...

906
00:58:34,535 --> 00:58:37,060
she might have grown up
to be just like you, Belinda.

907
00:58:37,137 --> 00:58:42,871
Even if I could accept your offer,
they'd never accept me into a good college.

908
00:58:42,943 --> 00:58:45,343
Most of the schools
don't even allow women.

909
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:50,406
Oh, posh! I'll just send up a smoke signal
to my friend Sam Gregory.

910
00:58:50,484 --> 00:58:53,749
Dr. Samuel Gregory?
The Dr. Samuel Gregory...

911
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,289
who founded Boston University
School of Medicine?

912
00:58:56,357 --> 00:58:58,450
Yes. One and the same.

913
00:58:58,525 --> 00:59:01,460
I don't know what to say.

914
00:59:01,528 --> 00:59:04,429
Well, say yes!

915
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:09,128
Thank you, Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
Thank you!

916
00:59:09,203 --> 00:59:15,142
<i>Now I know that you'll need to</i>
<i>talk this over with your family.</i>

917
00:59:15,209 --> 00:59:17,677
But when I leave next week...

918
00:59:17,745 --> 00:59:20,077
I hope you'll be with me.

919
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,010
[Sighs]

920
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:34,293
I think it is the opportunity
of a lifetime, Lindy.

921
00:59:34,361 --> 00:59:39,298
But Boston is very far away.
And we'd certainly miss you.

922
00:59:39,366 --> 00:59:43,803
And I'm gonna miss you and Papa and Grandpa
and Maddie and Jacob.

923
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:47,329
- I can't leave Jacob.
- We'll take good care of him.

924
00:59:47,408 --> 00:59:50,275
Besides, we all knew you were going to
have to leave Anderson Corner one day...

925
00:59:50,344 --> 00:59:52,335
if you were going to get
a good education.

926
00:59:52,413 --> 00:59:54,847
It scares me about thinking
of leaving everyone.

927
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:58,316
When I came out here from back East,
I was scared too.

928
00:59:58,385 --> 01:00:03,618
So was I. When I left with my first husband
Willie, I had no idea what lay ahead.

929
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,659
The only thing I knew was that
I was leaving the only home I'd ever known.

930
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:10,819
How'd you both do it?

931
01:00:10,953 --> 01:00:14,252
When you face the unknown, you have to
gather every ounce of courage you possess.

932
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:18,885
Then tell yourself if it's the right thing to do,
everything will work out fine.

933
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:21,395
And if it doesn't,
you can always come home.

934
01:00:21,463 --> 01:00:25,456
- So you think I should go?
- I think you should do what
your mama and I both did.

935
01:00:25,534 --> 01:00:28,196
<i>Pray about it.</i>
<i>And then decide.</i>

936
01:00:42,451 --> 01:00:45,579
Belinda.
What a wonderful surprise.

937
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:47,645
I can only stay a moment, Drew.

938
01:00:47,723 --> 01:00:50,556
Something entirely unexpected's
happened and I wanted to let you know.

939
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:53,754
- I hope it's something good.
- Actually, it's amazing.

940
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:58,163
Mrs. Stafford-Smith has asked me to go to Boston
with her. She's gonna put me through school.

941
01:00:58,233 --> 01:01:02,067
That's incredible.
I know what it must mean to you.

942
01:01:02,137 --> 01:01:04,162
You know, Boston isn't that far
from New York. Maybe we could-

943
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:06,434
That's just it, Drew.

944
01:01:06,508 --> 01:01:08,271
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

945
01:01:08,343 --> 01:01:11,437
As soon as I get my medical degree,
I'll be coming back here...

946
01:01:11,513 --> 01:01:13,743
practicing with Doc and hopefully
taking over for him someday.

947
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:17,546
You may change your mind when you get
to Boston. It has a great deal to offer.

948
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:22,682
It doesn't have what Anderson Corner does:
my family, people who really need me.

949
01:01:22,758 --> 01:01:25,921
- They probably won't have
a doctor when Doc's gone.
- Belinda, we can work this out.

950
01:01:25,994 --> 01:01:28,792
I've thought hard about this, Drew.
I've prayed even harder.

951
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:32,800
<i>I would never fit into your world.</i>
<i>My life is here.</i>

952
01:01:32,868 --> 01:01:35,701
The only way we could be together is
if one of us is miserable.

953
01:01:35,771 --> 01:01:38,331
- Belinda.
- I said what I came here to say.

954
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:41,932
Belinda.

955
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,944
Belinda!

<i>He hurt his leg recently.</i>
<i>Gangrene set in.</i>

959
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:11,335

- Will surgery save his life?

<i>With gangrene-[Sighs]</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

But if I don't do it,
he'll die within the day.

962
01:02:22,818 --> 01:02:24,581
I can help.

963
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:26,917
Belinda...

964
01:02:26,988 --> 01:02:31,152
this is life-threatening,
gruesome surgery.

965
01:02:31,226 --> 01:02:34,525
- I can handle it, Doc.
- [Sighs]

966
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:50,177
Cora, I need you to wait outside.
I'll come get you as soon as we're done.

967
01:03:01,456 --> 01:03:05,415
All right, Jonas.
I think we're ready to start.

968
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:08,054
Maybe you could say
a little prayer first.

969
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,896
Of course.
Uh, Belinda.

970
01:03:11,967 --> 01:03:15,733
Lord, we are eternally grateful
that you are here with us now.

971
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:18,705
And pray that you bless Doc

You know what would make
your son proud of you, Charles?

to do something very hard...

1135
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:51,559
It could have gone the other way.
I could have lost her, Drew.

1136
01:15:51,627 --> 01:15:53,652
But you didn't.

1137
01:15:53,729 --> 01:15:57,722
You were smart enough to figure out what to do
and brave enough to do it.

1138
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:02,436
I was terrified the whole time.

1139
01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:04,939
- It didn't stop you.
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>

1140
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:11,439
<i>Oh, Belinda, I have been</i>
<i>looking all over for you.</i>

1141
01:16:15,718 --> 01:16:19,017
What's happened? What is it?

1142
01:16:19,088 --> 01:16:21,784
Belinda saved my daughter's life.

1143
01:16:26,696 --> 01:16:29,824
How are you?
Open up for me.

1144
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:34,734
Well, I bet that throat is really sore, huh?

1145
01:16:34,804 --> 01:16:38,467
Good excuse for your mama
to churn some fresh buttermilk for ya.

1146
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:41,704
- I sure will.
- [Chuckles]

1147
01:16:52,822 --> 01:16:56,258
<i>You know,</i>
<i>you saved her life.</i>

1148
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:58,293
But I didn't save Jonas's.

1149
01:16:58,361 --> 01:17:01,296
Yes, um, about that.

1150
01:17:02,598 --> 01:17:04,725
[Sighs]

1151
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,395
I owe you a very big apology.

1152
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:11,963
Jonas's death wasn't your fault.

1153
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:14,100
But I couldn't hold him still.

1154
01:17:14,177 --> 01:17:16,270
But that's not why he died.

1155
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:20,213
<i>Jonas was dying</i>
<i>when he came to us.</i>

1156
01:17:20,283 --> 01:17:23,446
We were trying to save him,
but unfortunately...

1157
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:26,920
the surgery was
just too much for him.

1158
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:30,823
I told you how difficult
it is losing a patient.

1159
01:17:30,893 --> 01:17:35,956
<i>I've been practicing</i>
<i>for 40 years, give or take...</i>

1160
01:17:36,032 --> 01:17:38,023
and it never gets any easier.

1161
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,432
When it hurts this much...

1162
01:17:40,503 --> 01:17:43,961
it just means that...

1163
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,531
you care that much more
about your patients.

1164
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:50,101
Um, I don't think
I'm cut out to be a doctor.

1165
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:52,647
Oh, yes, you are, young lady.

1166
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:57,652
<i>You go back to Boston</i>
<i>with Mrs. Stafford-Smith.</i>

1167
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,453
But you just make darn sure that
you come back here when you're a doctor.

1168
01:18:03,893 --> 01:18:05,827
Doc-

1169
01:18:05,895 --> 01:18:08,625
Well, now...

1170
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:11,963
don't start crying or I'll-

1171
01:18:12,034 --> 01:18:14,969
I'll think I made
a mistake after all.

1172
01:18:23,446 --> 01:18:25,437
Whoa.

1173
01:18:33,289 --> 01:18:35,985
That's for having more faith in me
than I had in myself.

1174
01:18:57,747 --> 01:19:00,079
Come on. Hup.

1175
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:06,816
Are you sure you don't want us
to see you off at the stagecoach?

1176
01:19:06,889 --> 01:19:10,791
I'd rather we say good-bye here.

1177
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:14,296
You know, by train Boston
isn't as far as it once seemed.

1178
01:19:14,363 --> 01:19:16,297
Mm-hmm.

1179
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:19,630
- Are you all right, Belinda?
- Yes, Mama, I'm fine.

1180
01:19:19,702 --> 01:19:22,535
No second thoughts about leaving
with Mrs. Stafford-Smith?

1181
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:27,269
No, not anymore.
I feel at peace with my decision.

1182
01:19:27,343 --> 01:19:29,573
So your second thoughts
are about Drew?

1183
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,616
I love him, Mama.
I really do.

1184
01:19:34,684 --> 01:19:36,743
But it could never work.

1185
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:39,549
Sometimes one dream
is all you can have.

1186
01:19:49,532 --> 01:19:52,126
- Whoa. Whoa.
- [Neighs]

1187
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:54,135
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

1188
01:19:58,941 --> 01:20:02,968
I just wanted to say good-bye, Clark,
and thank you for everything.

1189
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:07,004
- You headed home?
- Charles and Sadie are moving onto the farm.

1190
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:10,780
I'm headed... back
to New York tomorrow.

1191
01:20:10,853 --> 01:20:13,788
<i>I, uh, imagine Belinda left.</i>

1192
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:17,189
We said our good-byes
with Missie this mornin'.

1193
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:20,251
She's probably getting
on the stage right about now.

1194
01:20:20,329 --> 01:20:25,096
You asked me once
when I knew I loved Marty.

1195
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,931
- But you never asked me what I did about it.
- What was that?

1196
01:20:28,003 --> 01:20:32,440
She left on a wagon train.
She was going back home.

1197
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:36,944
I went after her.

1198
01:20:37,012 --> 01:20:40,209
If you love someone, if you truly love them,
you don't let them go.

1199
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:47,716
- I've learned a lot from you.
- Then what are you doing still standing here?

1200
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:51,989
Don't you have a stage to catch?

1201
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:05,162
Last call, Denver stage!
All aboard, folks!

1202
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:08,472
- <i>Last call, Denver stage!</i>
- Come on.

1203
01:21:08,544 --> 01:21:10,478
Whoa. Belinda!

1204
01:21:10,546 --> 01:21:12,343
Oh, my goodness.

1205
01:21:13,816 --> 01:21:16,683
Don't go!

1206
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:22,386
I'll practice in Boston while you're in school.
Then we'll come back here.

1207
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:24,824
You'd be happy practicing law
in Anderson Corner?

1208
01:21:24,894 --> 01:21:29,797
Anderson Corner is the place
I learned to love the law, and it has you.

1209
01:21:29,865 --> 01:21:31,924
I don't think I could be
truly happy anywhere else.

1210
01:21:32,001 --> 01:21:35,698
- This isn't your world, Drew.
- You're my world.

1211
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:41,608
I love you, Belinda.
Marry me.

1212
01:21:46,749 --> 01:21:51,482
Oh, there's a train back to Boston most every day.
You'll catch one next week.

1213
01:21:51,554 --> 01:21:54,079
Windsor will meet you at the depot.
Won't you, Windsor?

1214
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,355
I'd love to marry you, Drew.

1215
01:22:28,691 --> 01:22:30,682
[Kisses Cheek]

1216
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,129
Do you, Andrew, take Belinda
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

1217
01:22:41,203 --> 01:22:44,661
<i>to have and to hold,</i>
<i>for richer and for poorer...</i>

<i>in sickness and in health, forsaking</i>
<i>all others, till death do you part?</i>

1219
01:22:49,512 --> 01:22:52,310
- I do.
- <i>And do you, Belinda, take Andrew...</i>

1220
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:54,110
<i>to be your lawfully</i>
<i>wedded husband...</i>

<i>in sickness and in health,</i>
<i>forsaking all others...</i>

1223
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:03,119
- <i>till death do you part?</i>
- I do.

1224
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,104
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1225
01:23:21,176 --> 01:23:23,167

01:23:39,328 --> 01:23:41,455

1229
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:15,930
Bye.

1230
01:24:15,998 --> 01:24:17,761
Mmm. Be safe.

1231
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:20,597
You know I will.
You know I will.

1232
01:24:20,669 --> 01:24:22,603
Take care, son.

1233
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:25,572
- Thank you so much.
- Bless you.

Be good.

Marty.

1240
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,024
Take care.

- Absolutely.
