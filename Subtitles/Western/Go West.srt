1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,400
Once, the most open socialist
society

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,920
disintegrates in the early 90's
in bloody interethnic conflicts.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,720
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
the central Yugoslav republic,

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,920
broke in the summer of 1992.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,200
Following the Serbian aggression the nations
of Bosnia started a war to destruction.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,440
Ethnicity was at the same time
a guarantee for life

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,480
and a shortcut to death.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,560
Two homosexuals,
a Muslim and a Serb,

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,960
are trying to save their lives
and their love.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,040
This is a story about them.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,280
My name is Kenan Dizdar.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,680
I was born in Bosnia. Muslim.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,440
As such i was circumcised
after birth.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,400
Excuse me.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,120
There's a war going
on in my country.

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,640
The Serbs who are of
Orthodox religion, hate Muslims.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,160
The Muslims of faith,
don't like the Serbs.

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,840
The Croats also live there,
they're Catholic,

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,880
sometimes they like the Muslims,
mostly they don't.

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,280
I think they presently don't
like each other.

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,280
But this will stop one day.

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,800
They will lay down the guns and
forget about the massacres.

23
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,440
But they will continue
to hate homosexuals as before.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,520
On the Balkans it's easier
to bear

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,560
if someone in the family is
a murderer rather then a faggot.

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,840
Go West

27
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
Dedicated to my father
and the great Sergio Leone

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
Sarajevo, summer of 1992

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,640
Comrades and colleagues,
good evening.

30
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,040
We are witnessing
unpleasant events in our country.

31
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,920
Yugoslavia, our country isn't
the one,

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
that we fought for.

33
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,000
We shouldn't allow the demon of war
to capture our beloved Bosnia.

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,800
We shouldn't allow
the shed of blood here.

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,360
We have been living together
in Bosnia for centuries,

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,880
Serbs, Muslims, Croats and other
nations and nationalities.

37
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,200
- I have a gun for you.
- What the fuck will i do with a gun?

38
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,120
- So the house won't be empty.
- I don't have a house, dude.

39
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,080
Just fool around!
When they come to slaughter you...

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,240
We have gathered today, so
that music as a universal language

41
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,040
would become a universal prayer
for sense and peace.

42
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,440
The string quartet from our
Academy of Music will be performing.

43
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,440
So you don't want a gun?

44
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,120
Fuck you, the gun and the war.

45
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
- Stop it! - Ok, fine, it wasn't
intentional. Leave me alone.

46
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,880
A Serb doesn't attack
another Serb.

47
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,920
Beware of others, Milan.

48
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,000
A musical prayer for peace

49
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,200
Milan, wait. What's wrong with you?

50
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,680
Nothing. I though it would be maybe
better

51
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,200
- if they didn't see you with me.
- You're talking rubbish. - Seriously.

52
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,800
- Maybe you prefer that blond girl.
- This has no sense.

53
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,320
- What happened to you?
- No biggie, I hurt myself while training.

54
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,640
I am mad at you because you didn't
come to listen to me play.

55
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,800
I know how you play.
I've heard you for a hundred times.

56
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,600
- I love your playing.
- There was something else tonight.

57
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,680
- Something important.
- For who? - For all of us.

58
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,840
For me, for you. Do you think that all
those people came just for the fun of it?

59
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Come here, let me tell you something.
Stop here.

60
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,240
First promise me that
you won't get angry.

61
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,560
Nod with your head.
You won't get angry?

62
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,440
Let Milan tell you. I find
your playing wonderful,

63
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,680
but you played for the dick.

64
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,400
What prayer for peace, you fool,
when everybody is preparing for war!

65
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
- You should run.
- That's the easiest thing to do.

66
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,680
- Do i have to stay? - That's the easiest.
- Are you fucking with me? - You're cheeky.

67
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
- No you're nervous as a
peasant bride. - Fuck...

68
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,560
You should have trusted Milan when
he suggested that we should have escaped.

69
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,080
And i was persuading him that
he was talking rubbish,

70
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,840
until the war started
and in my home town to begin with.

71
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,640
They killed all the circumcised
ones on the streets like dogs.

72
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,840
They had enough time
and hatred in them,

73
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,680
that they checked everyone
in their pants before shooting.

74
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,120
Turn it off.

75
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I saw my house.

76
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,480
Mother's linen rope
and the sweater drying off.

77
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,520
What's with my parents?

78
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,280
Keno, we'll destroy our lives
here.

79
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,760
We must go west.

80
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,560
You can talk,
since you're not circumcised.

81
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,520
- You're really exaggerating.
- I'm exaggerating?

82
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,280
You don't care about the slaughtering
and killing!

83
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,440
Because your dick is according to the official
policy, you're not circumcised and Muslim.

84
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,920
Go fuck the Serbs and the Muslims!

85
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,480
Once in your life you have to obey me.
We have to go away.

86
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,000
Quick, quick!

87
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,320
Faster, get inside!

88
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,520
- They'll kill me for sure.
- Shut up, calm down.

89
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,200
You, out!

90
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,120
You too.

91
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
- Where are you taking them?
- Get back! Silence!

92
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,640
What is it, you Turk?!

93
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,960
Please, don't!

94
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
Salam Aleykum, Turks.

95
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,040
What, no answer?

96
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
There will be.

97
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,400
They will take down his pants too.

98
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,000
Mom, I'm afraid.

99
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
What are you doing?

100
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Will you give me a kerchief please?

101
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,880
What are you doing?

102
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
- Tie it up at the back.
- Hold the child, I'll do it.

103
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,920
People are afraid of flying,
darkness, closed spaces,

104
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,080
ozone holes,
all kinds of stupidities,

105
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,480
which they all forget once they
really scare themselves.

106
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
In peace time i was afraid
they would discover that I'm gay,

107
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,920
in war time I'm afraid that they'll
take of my pants.

108
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,440
- Where are you going? Are you a Serb?
- Of course you are!

109
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,120
- Fuck the papers. - Look,
we're the same! What else do you need?

110
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
Milan got an idea in all the panic.

111
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,880
Instead of the Chetniks taking my clothes off,
he put me in a skirt.

112
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,880
I just have to put my wife in some safe place,

113
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
then I'll get myself armed as well.

114
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,480
Is the wife ours too?

115
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,680
She's mine, brother, mine.

116
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,600
Stop.

117
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,640
Thank you.

118
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,640
Muslims used to live here before.

119
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,120
I hope some survived.

120
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,960
We have to go west, Kena.
There is no future here.

121
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,360
Don't fear, Ljubo will take care of everything.

122
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,840
You don't know him, he's law itself.

123
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,200
- Look at him! - Hello.
- Hi Milan. - How's it going?

124
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,440
What's it like in the city?
We're on fire aren't we?

125
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,600
- What are you doing?
- Working.

126
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,760
- How are you? How is Ljubo?
- We're fine. Ljubo's fine as well, thank God.

127
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
You're always like that.

128
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,920
He'll die of happiness when he sees
you.

129
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,520
- Did you bring the bride?
- She's beautiful, isn't she?

130
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,600
Beautiful and quite,
but shy.

131
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,040
See you.
Let's go surprise Ljubo.

132
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,600
- Did you lose a bit of weight? See you.
- Say hello to Ljubo.

133
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,080
Stop! God help and hands up!
Password!

134
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,760
- Hi, Alan. You've grown up.
- Password!

135
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,600
Don't play with this or someone
will shoot you.

136
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,880
- Password!
- Get lost.

137
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,840
It's Sunday, everyone is in church.

138
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,480
Come.

139
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,960
Milan!

140
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,440
Son!

141
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,680
My son!

142
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,720
- Thank god you've managed to break
through the city. - Alive and healthy.

143
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,320
Hello, uncle Jovo.

144
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,800
Dad, this is Milena.
We've come together from Sarajevo.

145
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,120
Well done, Milena.

146
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,040
Let's go in the house children.
Milena, love, come.

147
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,520
Ranka, tell Ljubo to send more
sausages.

148
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,360
As long as you've come son!

149
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,400
Give me the plate.

150
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,680
If there wasn't a war going on,

151
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,640
- this would be the most happy day in
my life. - I know.

152
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,640
Take this to Milena, she's hungry.

153
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,320
- I will. She'll like it better.
- Oh?

154
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,960
This is from Ljubo.

155
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,360
- Did he come?
- He's in the house.

156
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,360
Is it you, you little Lunjara?!

157
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,880
Fuck!

158
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,680
- Is it ringing? - It's ringing.
- How are you brother?

159
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,480
- A good thing that the war started.
- Why? I wouldn't see you otherwise.

160
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,800
- Shut up. Go.
- Wait. First the bride.

161
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,240
- Lunjo must see the bride.
- Milena.

162
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,600
Lunjo, my best friend.
We're like brothers.

163
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,440
- I was your friend. - What are you saying?
- You've been away for ages.

164
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,480
Then you come with your bride
and think that i will forgive you.

165
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,440
Kids, i see everything.
I see and say nothing.

166
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,000
Times are hard.

167
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,880
Lunjo, provide the papers at once,
so they get out of here as soon as possible.

168
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,120
I would, but not even a bird
can't get out.

169
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,280
A bird doesn't have D-Marks and Dollars,
I have.

170
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,640
If so, there shouldn't be any problems.

171
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Drina.

172
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,480
They're good.

173
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,920
Milan I'm off to the coffeehouse.
Don't stay too long.

174
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,920
Lunjo, come with me.

175
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,200
Sit down.

176
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,800
Brother!

177
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,840
Kenan Dizdar, my friend.

178
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,800
I need papers for him,
some clothes and a wig.

179
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,280
Papers are no problem.
But where should I find a wig?

180
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,600
Are you in logistics or not?

181
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,000
One more thing. When they released me,
they wrote down all the information about me.

182
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,720
I have to drop in the nearest
commander's office tomorrow.

183
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,680
You've scared me, damn it!
I thought it was something serious.

184
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,320
On week on the battlefield,
one week at home.

185
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,040
When it starts firing,
you bend and bye bye.

186
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,120
I'll get you the papers,
you'll desert and everything will be fine.

187
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,880
- Thank you brother.
- You're welcome, brother!

188
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Ljubo worked for all of his life
in a Texas mine in the USA.

189
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,840
After Milan's' mother passed away,
when there was nobody else left,

190
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,960
to wait for the postman with
a fistful of dollars

191
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,160
and take care of Milan,
Ljubo returned home.

192
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,400
He opened a coffeehouse and brought
home a piece of America with him.

193
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,640
- Don't cut all of my hair.
- Stop it, it's fine.

194
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,000
Well done!
I don't know who's more beautiful.

195
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,640
Why are you scaring me?

196
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,600
Listen. I though how young,
beautiful and busty she was.

197
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,720
- It turns out she has a dick.
- Shut up! - I'm sorry, bride.

198
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,680
You've cut your hair. Well done!

199
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,120
- What is it? Did you lose all your
sense for humour? - Stop it.

200
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,920
Listen, bride.
Try out the wig.

201
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,080
If it suits you, I'll make some
photos of you

202
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
and you'll get the papers first thing tomorrow.

203
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,480
That's it, honey.
Lick your lips.

204
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,240
- Tits out. Good.
- Come on, Lunjo!

205
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,720
You've fucked up my frame.
Be quiet when I make photos.

206
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,960
It's good. Finished.

207
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,520
How's it going bride?

208
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,520
I pee while standing. I'm not used to
these kinds of toilets.

209
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,760
I see. You city girls aren't used to
our rural circumstances.

210
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,600
I'm prone to infections so I have
take care of myself.

211
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,560
I know dear. We women
have to protect ourselves,

212
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,040
cause men won't do it.
They don't care!

213
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,080
I've slaughtered a pig.
Ljubo told me to do so.

214
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,960
I'll wash myself then I'll fetch some
water. Come with me.

215
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,480
Come, you've nothing else to do anyway.

216
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,200
Milan is good. Fine.

217
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,840
You won't be alone in
the long nights.

218
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,600
My god, how good it is to have a man
in bed,

219
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,320
- if only sleeping!
- Mother!

220
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,200
If nothing else,
he warms you up a bit.

221
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,240
Let's rest. Come, sit down.

222
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,200
I live here. Come chat with me if you ever
feel bored.

223
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,680
Loneliness is killing me.

224
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,000
- Howdy, Milena.
- Howdy, Milena.

225
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,720
- Bitches!
- Stop!

226
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,160
- Hands up! Password?
- Get lost you crazy bastard!

227
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,360
You could have raised your bastard
better.

228
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,200
You could have shown who the father is!
What will you do then?

229
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,440
Look at them bitches, running.

230
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,480
Why is there no water in your village?

231
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,880
He who destroys Godly creations,
will have his well dried-up, they say.

232
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,960
When our people burned down the village
and the mosque

233
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,120
our well dried up.

234
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:39,120
And what else can they do? They have
to go to their village to fetch water.

235
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,480
Nobody hangs out there.
They get the water and hurry back.

236
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,000
I don't care.

237
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,840
I've got water from them even
before the war.

238
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,400
- It's easier to walk on a straight road then
uphill. - What's with the villagers?

239
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,320
In war people are like beasts,
like a herd.

240
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,520
The larger herd eats the smaller one.

241
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,960
The Muslims were good
neighbours.

242
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,200
They didn't manage to realise what
came upon them.

243
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,280
It quickly passed by,
for them it ended quickly.

244
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,760
Let's go, it's getting dark.

245
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,000
Sit, woman.
We're in no hurry.

246
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,600
Even if we were in hurry, we would
have nowhere to go.

247
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,480
What do those shoes mean?

248
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,680
So that the traces are not lost.

249
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,000
Did anyone survive?

250
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,160
For those that survived and for those
that didn't, it's all the same.

251
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,720
And?

252
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
What?

253
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,880
What is Milan like?

254
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,120
What are you saying?

255
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,520
Are you shy?
Do you feel awkward because of me?

256
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,560
Come on, you can tell me.
What is he like?

257
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,720
Is he good? Such a stalwart must
be good.

258
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,440
Pour water on my back.

259
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,800
If you intend to take down your tits,
you better lock the door first.

260
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,480
What did they tell you in the army?

261
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,520
They wrote down everything, got the information.
They will send Lunjo to inform me.

262
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,520
- No, no!
- Get lost!

263
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,360
We consider all non-Muslim women
as enemy.

264
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,840
We will deal with quickly.

265
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,240
For women, non-Muslim...

266
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,960
- Stop, men over here!
- Prove it!

267
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm male! Muslim!

268
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,760
- Get up you lovebirds!
- Get dressed quickly.

269
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Hurry up children,
the wedding guests are waiting.

270
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,560
- Whose wedding guests?
- I'm afraid our wedding guests.

271
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,840
- What is this, Ljubomir?
- A sweet toast.

272
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,400
And good luck!

273
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,320
Good lucky, newlyweds!

274
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,160
- Who says I will get married?
- I do, son. I don't want to wait anymore.

275
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,440
I want to keep nice memories when
you two leave.

276
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,280
You can see how the times are.

277
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:01,280
Good luck! Uncle Ljubo,
I have brought the dress and the present.

278
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,840
- Did you know about this?
- I didn't just know! I organised it all.

279
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,240
I promised Ljubo I wouldn't,
tell anyone about it.

280
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,520
<i>Let Mecca and Medina know,
let NATO and Pristina know,</i>

281
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,520
<i>that nobody shall beat the Serbs.</i>

282
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,840
- Are you crazy? - Look at the dress
you got from the marriage witness!

283
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,560
I have one for you as well my bride.

284
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,200
Only I know. You have to look at this
from the positive perspective.

285
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,680
Firstly, after the marriage no one will
suspect, that Kenan isn't Milena.

286
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,840
Secondly, the military will give the
groom a day off.

287
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,920
Thirdly,
you will fulfil father's wish.

288
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,600
Fourthly, we'll get the papers so
you two can leave.

289
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,520
We you get to the west, you divorce.

290
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,880
Milan, Milena,
hurry up, children!

291
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,280
My daughter-in-law
will get the same present,

292
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,520
that my late mother gave to my
departed Gospava.

293
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,960
The bride is more beautiful then the groom.

294
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,200
A woman is in command
in Rankovic's house once again.

295
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,480
May she be alive and well.

296
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,040
And may she get pregnant
as soon as possible.

297
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,800
Let it be known, that Ljubo is giving away
his son to be married!

298
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,960
Christ united you in one body
and in one soul.

299
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,280
Let the seed of your body
step onto the bastion of Serbianhood

300
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,760
and may Serbia stretch from
New York to Tokyo. Amen.

301
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,000
Slow down, master Ljubo.
We won't have glasses tomorrow.

302
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,520
I'll never do it again, Ranka.

303
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,440
Newlyweds,
I'm enjoying myself when people are happy.

304
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,120
Then take a photo, witness to the marriage.

305
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,600
When I say birdie,
press on the button. Do you understand?

306
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,920
When I go there
and say birdie from there,

307
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,520
peep through the hole.
When you see us all in it,

308
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,960
press the button.

309
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,200
You'll see, Batman
will fuck up again.

310
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,920
Birdie!

311
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,560
- Why was this necessary?
- I don't know.

312
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,200
Ljubo couldn't wait to have his
son married.

313
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,280
- I also didn't know anything.
- Fuck that.

314
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,960
I mean everything around us.

315
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
Hatred.

316
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,200
Everybody hates.

317
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,000
Do you hear me?

318
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,160
As though they only hated each other since
old times.

319
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,600
Fuck them! Listen to this.

320
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,040
The Netherlands.
Parliamentary monarchy.

321
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,120
Surface
41.526 square kilometres.

322
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,600
15.919.000 inhabitants.

323
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,960
Plus two, you and me.

324
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,440
In one day 4 seasons change

325
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,680
the mood never does.
Are you listening to me?

326
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,080
The number of bicycles is approximately
the same as the number of inhabitants.

327
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,920
The manufacture of weapons is minimum.

328
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,760
The production of flowers maximum.

329
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,400
With tulips they supply
65% of the world market.

330
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,760
The highest peak is 321 meters.

331
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,760
Fertility is 13%,
mortality is 9%.

332
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,440
Thank God I have lived to see that my
daughter-in-law cooks me lunch.

333
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,280
Good appetite.

334
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,240
You've made an excellent lunch,
daughter-in-law.

335
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,920
I don't know if I can endure.

336
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,800
You will. We must.

337
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,680
I'm afraid Ranka will see through me.

338
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,960
- She's been inspecting me too much.
- Don't fear. She doesn't understand a thing.

339
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,320
- Like hell she doesn't understand.
- Seriously. She's an unlucky woman.

340
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,160
You're the only woman of sort,
that actually speaks to her.

341
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
Why?

342
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,960
Women avoid her,
men want to fuck her.

343
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,920
- It's been like that for years.
- Whose is Alen then?

344
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,400
Nobody knows, they're all afraid
to ask. He surely isn't mine.

345
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,480
I'd like to know what happened
to my parents.

346
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,760
I don't know
how to find out such information.

347
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,360
I've asked Lunjo.

348
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,640
If it's possible to get to them,
he'll do it.

349
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,080
- Just as long as I know if they're alive.
- Everything will be fine, you'll see.

350
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,200
In the Netherlands it will be easier for
us to find out about it and help.

351
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,960
<i>The negotiations for the end of the
conflicts in Bosnia have ended unsuccessfully.</i>

352
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,760
<i>The representatives of the belligerent
sides and international negotiators</i>

353
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,360
<i>haven't found a common solution for the
end of the bloodshed.</i>

354
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,960
<i>According to independent observers,
the failure of peace negotiations</i>

355
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,440
<i>will lead to more bloodshed
and the number of victims will increase.</i>

356
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,240
Cunts!

357
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,280
Shout yourself in the leg,
through the muscle.

358
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,200
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

359
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,080
Don't go to the battlefield,
stay alive.

360
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,920
Everything will be fine. We'll laugh
at all of this, believe me.

361
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,840
The war is a crossing phase
from a man to a soldier.

362
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,280
If you don't wear a skirt, you carry a gun.
I got the first, Milan got the second.

363
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,120
- Take care of yourself. - I will. You too.
- Shoot through your muscle. It doesn't hurt.

364
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,600
Be sensible, my bride.

365
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,800
Nobody has asked me nor him, what
we want.

366
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,760
He got a call-up from the army
before the papers for the west arrived.

367
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,920
I'll never know for sure,
if I was more afraid,

368
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,520
of him going, or because I stayed.

369
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,840
Fuck it, man.

370
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,800
Watch your head.

371
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,120
Squad, attention!

372
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,440
A bit faster.
Civilians, withdraw..

373
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,080
Brothers, for 500 years we have
been stamped down by the Turkish boot.

374
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,760
- All things come to he who waits.
- What is this noise?

375
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,120
The time for revenge has come!

376
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,360
Time for us to settle the account
with Muslims.

377
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,920
Off with you, god damn it!
Get lost!

378
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,240
Enough of smirking!

379
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,040
The whole world is against Serbs.
The Vatican, Mecca, Washington,

380
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,640
Berlin, Constantinople.
Our Saint Sava put it nicely:

381
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,320
Only Unity Saves the Serbs.

382
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,640
Go with god's help.

383
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,760
Forward, march!

384
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,120
Let's go, daughter.

385
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:50,200
- Mister, is there anything to eat?
- We'll find something. - Some spoon food.

386
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,160
May God give.

387
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,960
Daughter-in-law go get Ranka.
These men have come...

388
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,920
What else can I do?

389
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,240
If there's nobody else,
I have to help myself.

390
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,720
- Where did you come from?
- Ljubo sends me.

391
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,320
Some guests have arrived,
he needs help.

392
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,800
<i>Everybody hated Ranka, except
Ljubo. They were afraid of her.</i>

393
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:10,320
<i>There was something shuddering
about this village witch.</i>

394
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,560
<i>Yet when I looked at her,
when she was piling up those shoes...</i>

395
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,400
<i>I become tender after smoking marihuana.</i>

396
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,720
<i>In this barrenness of poverty and stones</i>

397
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,960
<i>this was the only grass,
that wasn't missing.</i>

398
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,680
Let's go, Milena.

399
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,480
<i>After every new joint I almost
grew fond of Ranka.</i>

400
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,520
<i>Me and her were the only women
with a secret.</i>

401
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,480
Stop!

402
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,160
Bring the water, women.

403
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,520
When I say water, I mean the horse.

404
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,200
Don't give water to Muslims you
fool!

405
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,120
Please sir, I beg you.

406
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,560
Sir! Like hell, Sir!

407
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,320
Let's go!

408
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,120
What is it, dear?
Why are you crying? Don't.

409
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,200
I'm used to being beaten.
I'll endure.

410
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,880
This will be over once.

411
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,480
One day, God will take a look at Ranka too.

412
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,840
What are you saying?

413
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,880
- Mum, what happened?
- Nothing. What should have happened?

414
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,200
Pick up the bucket.
Do something, be useful.

415
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,800
Let's go home.

416
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:02,760
This war! No school, nothing.
Children are wasting their time.

417
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,720
All they hear is war and hatred.
Nobody mentions school.

418
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,520
What kind of people will
they become?

419
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,480
Put two balls of wool
between your breasts

420
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,680
and carry them for like a week.

421
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,960
Then knit socks out of them for him.
It helps.

422
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,720
This is a spell for a big love.

423
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,080
Let me foretell you from coffee.

424
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,120
No, it's not good! I see tears.

425
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,480
and blood.

426
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,080
But you'll save yourself,
don't fear.

427
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,080
I also see a path.
Look how long it is.

428
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,720
Press with your finger
and make a wish.

429
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,600
That's it.

430
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:15,200
The path again, look.
You'll go alone on this journey.

431
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,160
Look at the spectacle man!
He'll make the nation mourn.

432
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,840
- What a shitty hairdo.
- Fuck the war!

433
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,320
Resting? You've worked too
much and are tired out.

434
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,760
- Take care so you don't get blisters
on your ass. - Can you see them?

435
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,520
Milena, I hear you're playing.

436
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,160
if that's true, we're colleagues.

437
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,320
Look at this Milena.

438
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,120
You fools!
Why does God punish me this way,

439
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,040
so I have to come across these
two every time?

440
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,760
Mother, help!

441
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,640
Help!

442
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,600
Are you alright?

443
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,560
I'm fine.

444
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,720
Leave me alone,
I'll show them!

445
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,760
Milena, you almost burned down.
Didn't you, darling?

446
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,760
This one will suit you.

447
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,520
Change your clothes. Take your skirt off.

448
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,600
I'll do it over there.

449
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,280
Undress.

450
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,680
Darling, I'm happy that you're not a woman.

451
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,360
Ranka can keep secrets.

452
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,480
You didn't tell me
where they injured you, hero.

453
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,360
In the cunt!

454
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,280
The string on the guitar broke.

455
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,960
Poor me! Stevo my darling,
why have you left me?

456
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:25,400
Why have you left me,
so I have to raise the children alone?

457
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,960
Priest! This is a requiem
for the deceased,

458
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,120
not for your
political speeches!

459
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,400
You bug us in the coffeehouse
at least leave us alone in church.

460
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,000
- Leave it, I'll do it.
- No, it's not hard.

461
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,280
- When will Milan come?
- Soon.

462
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,960
We'll soon get the papers
from Belgrade,

463
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,320
then go your way.

464
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,840
Milena, daughter. Sit down, so we can
have a drink.

465
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,800
Sit down if I tell you so.

466
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,280
I've bribed
Milan's commander,

467
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,120
so he will let him off on leave.

468
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,360
When you won't return any more,

469
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,160
let the bastard
come and enlist me.

470
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,400
My child, you can buy everything here
with money except happiness.

471
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,920
There is no happiness here.

472
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,320
Maybe there would be, if we drove
away all the Muslims.

473
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:31,120
And that handful of Croats
and in the end us Serbs too.

474
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,400
They should exile us all into
hell.

475
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,600
Then they should populate Bosnia
with normal people,

476
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,320
that will be able to enjoy
its beauty.

477
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,280
Listen daughter-in-law.

478
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,880
You haven't played for me on that
wonder of yours.

479
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,080
Here they only play on one chord for me.

480
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,200
You know Vladimir,
who Leon Trotsky was?

481
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,560
He was a commander, general, God.
You know what he said?

482
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,840
That politics can interfere in everything
except art.

483
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,640
It shouldn't interfere in art.

484
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,880
Wait.

485
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,680
- You haven't told me who came up
with this idea. - What?

486
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,120
That you play a woman's role.

487
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,480
- Milan figured it all out.
- What do you intend to do now?

488
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:42,120
- What do you mean?
- Will you run away? - Who?

489
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,720
- You and Milan or just you?
- As soon as we can.

490
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,200
- Don't leave without me.
Take me with you. - How?

491
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,600
- You mustn't leave without me.
- Listen, Ranka.

492
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,080
It would be better if this didn't happen
at all.

493
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,880
But it did happen!
You're mine now. Mine!

494
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:22,360
- Stop! Password!
- You're too old for these games.

495
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,320
- Password!
- You rather prosecute girls.

496
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,840
- Milan! - Ranka.
- How is it on the battlefield?

497
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,880
- How should it be?
- You have a beautiful bride.

498
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,160
- Thank you. Are they ok?
- You know Ljubo.

499
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,240
He always worries about you.
Milena takes good care of him.

500
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,840
- And you? You miss the bride,
is that why you're hurrying home? - A little bit.

501
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,960
- I don't know if she misses you.
- What would like to say?

502
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,880
That what you do is great.

503
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,840
- What am I doing?
- Saving a friend!

504
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,400
Saving what can be saved.

505
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:29,320
- Don't worry, it will be our secret.
- What secret?

506
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,720
What you know, Ranka now knows as well.

507
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,520
- Are you crazy? - What's wrong with you?
- They'll kill us all, you fool!

508
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,800
- What's with you?
- Who will kill us?

509
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,800
Do you know who Ranka is?!

510
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:02,520
You'll fuck everything up. Us,
departure to the Netherlands.

511
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,000
They will kill us, because your dick
can't stay still in your pants.

512
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,640
What do you want from me?

513
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,360
Should I knit socks for
Serb fighters?

514
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,360
You don't know anything. You get high on marihuana
and you don't give a damn about anything.

515
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,720
You don't know Ranka!
Don't put me and Ljubo in danger.

516
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,400
You know how much I risk because of you.

517
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:43,440
Listen to me, Kenan.
You have no one left.

518
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,280
I didn't want to tell you this
until we're in the Netherlands.

519
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,040
Your parents are dead.

520
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:06,400
You only have me left.
Make a decision.

521
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:24,160
I have no one left.
I'm Kenan Dizdar, a Muslim.

522
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:33,360
And I am not a faggot, Milan.
I'm not a faggot. Go away!

523
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,200
Away from me!

524
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,360
Get lost!

525
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,600
- Will you kill me now?
- You'll get us all killed.

526
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,160
- Where are you going? - To the battlefield.
- Aren't you free this week?

527
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,720
It's better in the trenches,
then watching this.

528
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,680
A Serb likes to join the army.

529
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,800
I'll be back,
when we get the papers.

530
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,960
I love you, Kenan.

531
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,240
Milan!

532
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,080
Milan...

533
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,840
He who foreign happiness takes,
let his own be flushed with blood.

534
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,840
<i>If there was no war,</i>

535
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,920
<i>if they weren't Serbs
and we weren't Muslims,</i>

536
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,160
<i>my parents would still be alive.
I would never wear a skirt.</i>

537
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,360
<i>Ranka would continue to poison this
village with fear,</i>

538
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,200
<i>Ljubo would be
destroying himself with brandy.</i>

539
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,360
<i>Me and Milan would be just two
gays, that know how to hide</i>

540
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,800
<i>and learn to love.</i>

541
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,360
Ljubo, a telegram has arrived.

542
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,240
My condolences.

543
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Motherfuckers!
Let them die, enemies!

544
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:20,280
Heroic blood has ennobled
your fireside too.

545
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,480
Whose blood, priest?

546
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,320
Whose blood, god damn it?!

547
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:38,320
Whose blood,
you agitating swine?!

548
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,440
Whose, priest?

549
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,400
My blood!

550
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:42,840
<i>Look what he's doing to us.
He doesn't allow anyone near.</i>

551
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,160
<i>Not even me.</i>

552
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,320
<i>I married Milan
and gave him a blessing,</i>

553
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:56,640
<i>when he went to war.
And Ljubo does this!</i>

554
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,240
Let's pray for Milan's soul.

555
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,520
Keep on working, uncle Ljubo.
The password isn't important.

556
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:47,600
What are you doing? They'll hear you.
Stop playing!

557
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,880
Get dressed so they don't see you.
Let's go home.

558
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,480
Please, let's go home.

559
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,800
I don't belong here..

560
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:09,880
I don't belong here.
I'm a Muslim.

561
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,600
You're not the only one.
Alen's dad was a Muslim.

562
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,920
From the village where we go to
fetch water.

563
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:25,760
- Milan's gone. - What are you talking about?
I am here, you have me.

564
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,560
- My word killed him.
- No. - I killed him.

565
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,640
- I killed him.
- You didn't.

566
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,160
Calm down, it's not your fault.
It was his destiny.

567
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,080
He's dead,
but I'm alive.

568
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:46,800
- What about me? - What?
Are you listening to me, Ranka?

569
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,560
I love Milan!

570
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,880
I love him.

571
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,240
I never loved a woman as much
as him. Do you understand?

572
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,840
That's not true.

573
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,360
- I love him.
- It's not true.

574
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,600
You're mine.

575
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,360
- Leave me alone!
- You're mine!

576
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,440
Leave me alone! Get away from me!

577
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,280
You're disgusting, I'm sickened by you!

578
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,280
Look!

579
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,840
They deceived us, Ljubo!

580
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,880
Milena is not Milena.

581
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,760
Your daughter-in-law is a man.
They deceived us.

582
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,200
Your Milan is a faggot.
You hear me? He's a faggot!

583
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,880
Don't talk about Milan in that way.

584
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,320
God damn!

585
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,920
You shouldn't insult Milan!

586
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,720
He's represents everything that is holy to me.

587
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,320
This is from Milan's
late mother.

588
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,400
There's enough money in here.

589
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,280
I don't need it anymore.

590
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,880
The papers have also arrived.

591
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,160
Take it and go.

592
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:57,280
Go and find your happiness.

593
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:09,400
For your and Milan's soul.

594
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,240
Come.

595
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,200
Go now.

596
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,080
Go west.

597
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:49,720
I curse on their mothers, all of them.

598
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,560
You're going west.

599
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:56,000
Lunjo promises you.

600
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:01,200
Don't fear.
Lunjo is with you.

601
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:08,040
I will desert as well.
War is a big pile of shit.

602
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,120
You know how much the industry
has progressed,

603
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,720
since we're fighting?

604
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,280
We must catch up with it, brother.

605
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,720
Like hell we'll catch up!

606
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,880
What can we catch up?

607
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,280
Fuck it, we're slaughtering each other
like in the Middle Ages,

608
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:34,400
abroad they're making computer chips.

609
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:39,000
You know, how much data can
a computer chip a size of a fingernail contain?

610
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:43,080
A million! And where are we?!

611
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:49,760
Persecuting each other on hills and in
forests,

612
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:53,680
like we didn't have anything
more intelligent to do.

613
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,480
You must go west,
if Lunjo tells you so.

614
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,640
Go west!

615
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
Western Europe, 1993

616
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,200
This is all.

617
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,160
I don't have a home no more,

618
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,200
nor a violoncello, nor a homeland.

619
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,680
My parents are gone.

620
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,120
I lost Milan.

621
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,920
I understand you, Kenan.

622
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:49,200
We're all shattered, horrified.

623
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,400
Every day we listen to the news
and we know,

624
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:59,520
what kind of horror you go through in your
homeland.

625
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,360
I've only got the music left.

626
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:11,400
You want to hear it?

627
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,640
Yes, with delight.

628
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,640
But how?

629
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,360
You don't have your instrument anymore.

630
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,080
I'm sorry...

631
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,080
I don't want to disappoint you,

632
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,680
but I didn't hear anything.

633
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,520
You should have told me to
play louder.

634
