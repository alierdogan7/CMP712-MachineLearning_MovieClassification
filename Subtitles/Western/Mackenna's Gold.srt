1
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:54,809
There's an old story.
The way the Apaches tell it...

2
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,926
...a man was riding in the desert
and came across a vulture...

3
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,560
...the kind they call turkey buzzards
in Arizona, sittin' on a rock.

4
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:07,842
"Hey," the man says, "how come you
old turkey buzzard's sittin' here?

5
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,758
"I saw you flying over Hadleyberg,
and I didn't want to meet up with you...

6
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,637
"...so I turned around and come this way."
Old turkey buzzard says:

7
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:19,325
"That's funny,
I was only passing through that town.

8
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:22,846
"I was really coming over here
to wait foryou."

9
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,405
A thousand years ago, in the Southwest,
there was an Apache legend.

10
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:14,720
It told about a hidden canyon, guarded
by the Apache gods and rich with gold.

11
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,641
As long as the Apaches kept the canyon
a secret and never touched the gold...

12
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,880
...they would be strong, powerful.

13
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,408
That was the legend.

14
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,758
When the Spanish Conquistadores came,
they searched for that canyon.

15
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:38,161
They called it "Caòón Del Oro,"
meaning Canyon of Gold.

16
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,365
But they never found it.

17
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:47,681
Three hundred years later,
the Americans came.

18
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,805
They heard about the legend, but they
called the canyon, "The Lost Adams."

19
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:59,838
That was because a man named Adams
saw it once, or so he said.

20
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,481
But whether he did or not,
he never saw anythin' again...

21
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:08,522
...because the Apaches
burned out his eyes.

22
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,122
Everybody knew about that legend
and a lot of people believed it.

23
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,959
Caòón Del Oro. The Lost Adams.

24
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:30,722
And then for a while there, back in 1874,
they called it, "Mackenna's Gold."

25
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,928
Take it easy, old man.
You're not healthy enough to play games.

26
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:45,921
I know you. You are Mackenna.

27
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,760
-The marshal.
-That's right, but I don't know you.

28
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,161
Why'd you try to bushwhack me?

29
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,687
Somebody pay you?

30
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,087
-Colorado?
-No pay. Nobody pay.

31
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:03,999
-Well, then, why?
-Because you look for gold.

32
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,877
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
an old man like you...

33
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:13,683
...going around shooting at prospectors.

34
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,679
Keep that up, you're gonna get in trouble.

35
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:21,047
Besides, if you know me, you know
I quit gold huntin' a long time ago.

36
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:26,125
The only dust I ever found was prairie dust.
Never got rich but I sure got thirsty.

37
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,763
But now you look for the gold again.

38
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,405
-Everybody look for the gold.
-What gold?

39
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:39,277
What gold?

40
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:56,126
I know this place. That's Shaking Rock.

41
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,477
No gold around there.

42
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:01,921
I've been there.

43
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,528
Why you stay with me?
Why you not kill me?

44
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,839
Well, that's what I oughta do.

45
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:25,167
Tell you what, you give me your word
you won't go around...

46
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,888
...pickin' off people anymore,
and I'll take you home.

47
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,197
No home.

48
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,085
Well, I'll get you to a doctor, anyway.

49
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:34,846
I die here.

50
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,763
Now you have the gold.

51
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:51,599
But you will wish you never see this map.

52
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:55,520
The spirits will kill you. No laugh.

53
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:59,008
It is a secret place.

54
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:04,323
So that's what it's supposed to be.
Caòón Del Oro, The Lost Adams.

55
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,924
Don't worry, old man,
I won't go looking for it.

56
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:12,446
Wasted three good years chasing that
wild goose. There is no Lost Adams.

57
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,602
It is bad time.

58
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,803
Young warriors want gold...

59
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,918
...like white men.

60
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:23,800
It is good time for old man to die.

61
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,043
Plenty of time for that, old man.
Don't rush it.

62
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,199
Feel like eating something?

63
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,397
Old man?

64
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,117
Old man.

65
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:08,281
I wish you hadn't shot at me.
I thought maybe you were someone else.

66
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,720
Soldiers. Many soldiers.

67
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:41,563
Sir, you have been most kind
and we are grateful.

68
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,403
We ask no more of your hospitality
than the loan of a few horses and mules...

69
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:48,925
...which we need,
and some food for our journey.

70
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,206
Also, we will take your wife...

71
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:56,558
...because if we run into trouble
with the Cavalry she may come in useful.

72
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,801
If we pass this way again, God willing,
I will sell her back to you.

73
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:03,280
That is a true promise.

74
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,166
Take a rest, Marshal.

75
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,717
We will finish the old man's grave.

76
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:10,121
We'll make it a little longer, a little wider...

77
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,559
...and then maybe we will
bury you together.

78
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,601
God is good to me.

79
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,287
You remember?
I told you I would come for you, old friend.

80
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,318
You'll never get back, old friend.

81
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:30,561
I will find a way.

82
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:35,205
Put that shovel down
and come and talk to Colorado.

83
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,838
Don't move, Mackenna,
or I'll cut you in half.

84
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:03,042
Now come out like a gentlemen.

85
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,879
You know, we've been trailing
that old man for two weeks now.

86
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:26,558
-Where's the map?
-Map? What map?

87
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:04,763
I know this fellow.
He's a good card player.

88
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:06,959
He always remembers the cards.

89
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,279
If he saw the map, he remembers it.

90
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,322
So we have a map in his head.

91
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,203
I told you.

92
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,759
I told you nobody runs me out.

93
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:21,527
And now I have you,
and you will take us to the gold.

94
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,040
And then I will kill you.

95
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,766
Hurry up, Besh.
Cover him with some rocks and let's go.

96
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,524
No. He is a chief.
He was going to Caòón Del Oro.

97
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:57,482
We bury him there.

98
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:02,483
Are you crazy?

99
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,763
You know how bad he's going to stink
by the time we get there?

100
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,845
Of course. He's a chief.
He must be buried there.

101
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,957
I should have thought of it myself.

102
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:41,602
Besh, come on.

103
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:21,845
In the old days, before Mackenna ran him
out of the territory...

104
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,847
...Colorado had a hideout
in a little box canyon.

105
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:28,882
Now that he was back,
he was using it again.

106
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:32,406
And that's where he took Mackenna,
his living map.

107
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,527
You're crazy to come back.

108
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,806
You know Judge Bergerman
put a price on your head.

109
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,558
You know, that's funny. I never lay eyes
on that Judge Bergerman.

110
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:31,517
But he don't like me.
Well, someday me and him will meet.

111
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,848
And I will take his head, in a basket.

112
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,279
Anyway, I came back
after that map you burned up.

113
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:43,962
Why? You can buy a dozen
just like it for a dollar a piece.

114
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,006
Not like that map. Not like the map
old Prairie Dog was carrying.

115
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:56,368
Well, that old man wasn't Prairie Dog.
Prairie Dog is dead.

116
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:57,962
He sure is now.

117
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,798
The whole thing is a fairy tale.

118
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,918
There's no Caòón Del Oro.

119
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:06,648
Old Adams was never there.

120
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:09,243
Then why did you kill
Prairie Dog and take his map?

121
00:25:09,329 --> 00:25:12,639
-That's not the way it happened.
-I know how it happened.

122
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:15,323
You just got tired of working
for $20 a month...

123
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:17,877
...so you took advantage
of that poor old man.

124
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,529
You bushwhacked him,
gunned him down, and took his map.

125
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:22,998
I'm surprised at you. A marshal.

126
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:44,562
-Hesh-ke remembers you.
-I remember her, too.

127
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:46,797
Hesh-ke.

128
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:53,444
What I can't figure out is how you knew
about this map. It's the only real one.

129
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:56,722
It was supposed to be
only in Prairie Dog's head.

130
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:59,687
He was supposed to pass it on
before he died.

131
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:02,806
Then somebody found out
there really was a map.

132
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:06,006
And two weeks ago,
the old man up and left the tribe.

133
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:08,444
Well, why didn't he pass it on?

134
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:12,521
I guess he didn't know who he could trust.

135
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:14,804
See, the Apache have changed.

136
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:18,004
They're beginning to think
like white men now.

137
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:21,968
Some of the young think they got more use
for that gold than those old spirits.

138
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,846
There isn't any gold.

139
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:27,041
And if there was,
it would belong to the whole tribe.

140
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,402
You're wrong.

141
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:35,048
That gold belongs to the spirits,
and they said I can have it.

142
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:41,484
Listen, old friend, I know you.

143
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,527
You're just like an Apache: very stubborn.

144
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:48,199
These other friends of mine here,
they are stubborn, too.

145
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:51,884
Why don't you just take us there
and we'll be partners?

146
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,364
-There's enough for all of us.
-I've been there.

147
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:57,885
There's not enough gold there
to fill your back tooth.

148
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:02,647
-You've been in the canyon?
-There's no canyon.

149
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:06,606
You don't know.
Listen, you like to gamble.

150
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,602
Let's take a chance.

151
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:10,281
Suppose we lose?

152
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:13,839
Well, then we split up
and you go wherever you want.

153
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:17,167
How? On foot with my hands tied
behind my back?

154
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:22,164
No. I'll give you anything you need.
Water, horses, your guns.

155
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:25,080
-When?
-When what?

156
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:26,404
The guns?

157
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:32,365
When you take us there.
I mean, you gotta prove yourself, no?

158
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:41,043
I'll tell you what else I'll give you.
I will give you the girl.

159
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:44,241
-What girl?
-The one you've been looking at.

160
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:47,568
I tell you the truth. Her husband's rich.

161
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:50,448
-You will get a big reward.
-No!

162
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:55,766
Monkey, what do we want?
We want the gold. Why?

163
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,243
Because when we get the gold,
we can buy all the women we want.

164
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:04,920
Besides, if Laguna don't show up
tomorrow, it's an extra share for all of us.

165
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,204
No.

166
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:10,325
You want the Scar-face? Take her.

167
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:13,525
Take the little fat one.

168
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:15,767
Take the old woman.

169
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,284
You can have lots of fun.

170
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,885
What do you say, we shake on it?

171
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:29,843
All right.

172
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:35,204
I'll take you there.
And the gold is all yours.

173
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,605
I'll take you there and then I go,
like you said.

174
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:41,604
No gold?

175
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:43,878
Why?

176
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:48,247
You like Hadleyberg so much?
They don't like you. That's what I hear.

177
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:52,203
I'll tell you the truth. I'm superstitious.

178
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:55,689
I don't want to tangle
with those Indian spirits.

179
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,522
-Okay. You're crazy, but okay.
-And another thing.

180
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:02,158
You tell your little boy there
I want all my stuff back.

181
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:06,005
Sure. I keep everything safe
for you until you go.

182
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:13,442
But there's no gold and there's no canyon.

183
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,959
I make the jokes, compadre.

184
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:23,717
Hesh-ke.

185
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:05,727
You're lucky.
Looks like she ain't holding no grudge.

186
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:08,482
She was mad. I think she still likes you.

187
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,527
Too bad I already gave her to Monkey.

188
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:14,204
You want to change your mind?

189
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,725
Sleep well, old friend.

190
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,078
Miss.

191
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,884
You know me. I'm Mackenna, the marshal.

192
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:40,485
I'm not going to hurt you.

193
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,848
You know me.

194
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:47,523
It was your father who made me marshal.

195
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:57,919
They killed my father.

196
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:04,286
They killed my father.

197
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:08,801
Don't tell any of them, nobody,
that you're Judge Bergerman's daughter.

198
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:14,680
If Colorado finds that out, you'll be
in worse trouble than you are now.

199
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,882
You understand?

200
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:37,448
You hear me?

201
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:52,202
Yes, I remember you.

202
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:55,323
You came out to the ranch once for supper.

203
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,798
That's right. I was once.

204
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:01,318
They say you like to play cards.

205
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:08,038
Well, yes, I enjoy an unfriendly game
of poker from time to time.

206
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:13,922
Off-duty, of course.
I take a drink now and then, too.

207
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:18,722
My father didn't hold with gambling
and neither do I.

208
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:21,449
Well, I know, Miss. I know that.

209
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:25,644
I'm trying to mend my ways. Seriously.

210
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,887
It doesn't look right for a marshal
to be playing cards. I know that.

211
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:32,488
Now you rest.

212
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:36,602
Try to sleep.

213
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,444
And remember what I told you.

214
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,640
We start early tomorrow.
Go get some sleep.

215
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:12,847
You see, I keep my end of the deal,
old friend. You keep yours.

216
00:35:14,889 --> 00:35:18,199
Better put your belt on.
You could lose your pants.

217
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:37,646
-Okay, come on.
-Ain't we gonna wait for Laguna?

218
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:43,205
Naw. He likes that girl in Hadleyberg
so much, let him get rich with her.

219
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:48,126
Man comes with flag.

220
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,559
Hesh-ke, take the girl inside.

221
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:42,677
I don't think they're looking for you,
Marshal.

222
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:45,920
But if they are, I would like to kill you.

223
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:52,439
I don't know how I'd get you
to that canyon if you did.

224
00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:57,843
You could with a broken kneecap.
Painful, but possible.

225
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,528
If you want to collect the reward on that
girl, remember that Hesh-ke has a knife.

226
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,963
Colorado!

227
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:08,198
John Colorado!

228
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:10,963
Ben!

229
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:14,121
Ben Baker! Ben!

230
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:15,763
-My old friend!
-No!

231
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:18,044
Stay where you are, Colorado.

232
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:21,926
Who's that with you?

233
00:37:24,169 --> 00:37:27,479
Why, Marshal. You and Colorado together.

234
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:30,128
Well, well, well.

235
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,722
-Surprised?
-No.

236
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:34,323
Some of the people with me might be,
but not me.

237
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:36,001
Not with a stake like this one.

238
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:40,321
No, this is no time for holding old grudges.

239
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:44,802
Speaking for myself, I'm glad you're here.
We can play some poker.

240
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,841
Not with your cards.

241
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:53,197
Welcome back, Colorado.
And there's enough for all of us.

242
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:56,929
-Enough?
-We know all about it.

243
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,487
We know you've been looking
for Prairie Dog.

244
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:04,159
We know you got the word from Besh
and Little Hatchet here.

245
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:10,564
How? And how'd you know we were here?
Nobody but us knows about this place.

246
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:17,641
Laguna.

247
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:20,841
Sorry, Colorado.

248
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,118
You know me.

249
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:26,960
-I drink too much, then I talk too much.
-Yeah.

250
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:28,718
Then they had me.

251
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:33,318
You see, didn't I say
Laguna shouldn't go into Hadleyberg?

252
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:36,641
Colorado, it's a big desert.

253
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:40,846
It's going to take a lot of eyes
to find that old man.

254
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:44,604
And after that,
it's going to be a long way to the canyon.

255
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:48,204
There's cavalry out after you.
More than you've ever seen.

256
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:52,407
And a lot of bronco Apaches on the prowl,
after anybody and everybody.

257
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:54,844
Probably after the gold, too.

258
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:58,243
You don't know what's going on out there.

259
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:01,997
You need us.

260
00:39:05,129 --> 00:39:06,642
One more thing.

261
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,757
You got yourself a mighty fine place here,
but it's a box canyon.

262
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:14,083
One way in, same way out.

263
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:18,640
We could camp outside
until you get awful hungry.

264
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:23,518
Well, there's a lot in what you say.

265
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:28,568
Of course, if the soldiers catch us together,
you will hang together with me.

266
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,484
If Mackenna's gonna
take a chance with you...

267
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:37,326
...that's good enough for me.

268
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:39,719
Well, what do you think, Mackenna?

269
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:45,162
I'm glad he's here.

270
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:49,204
Like he says,
we can play some poker along the way.

271
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:00,966
Besh, with respect, move the chief.

272
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:07,687
It is true that there's enough for all of us.

273
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:11,638
But it is also true
that it's a long way to the canyon.

274
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:18,727
It's a deal.
Come up and have some breakfast.

275
00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:26,159
Hold it!

276
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:29,242
He double-crossed me.

277
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:33,000
You all knew I'd kill him
the first chance I got.

278
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:39,125
Anyway, there's enough for all of us,
only now there'll be a little bit more.

279
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:47,004
Okay.

280
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:55,245
Only no more killing,
or there sure will be a lot of it.

281
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:30,840
You know, Ben, we've got a deal, but...

282
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:35,398
...I wish I could have seen
all your friends before we made it.

283
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:37,960
What's wrong with them?

284
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:44,125
These two, I don't know what they are.
And I'm afraid to guess.

285
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:51,045
We were just passing through Hadleyberg...

286
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:54,999
...and I'm afraid we overheard
a most interesting conversation.

287
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:59,161
Mr. Baker was kind enough
to allow us to join the group.

288
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:02,764
He promised this to be good sport.
And profitable, too.

289
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:05,764
Is that so?

290
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,122
Is that so?

291
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:11,484
Colorado.

292
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,445
Yeah. "Good sport."

293
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:22,087
I know this fellow.
You're the storekeeper from Hadleyberg.

294
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:26,203
Does your wife know where you are?

295
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:31,921
I don't know this one,
but he looks pale, too.

296
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:34,879
What are you? A dentist?

297
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:38,526
No. He's the editor
of the Hadleyberg Gazette.

298
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:44,881
-This one looks like a preacher.
-I preach.

299
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:48,361
-Yeah? What you preach, gold?
-The Word of God.

300
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:50,481
Yeah, but you like gold, right?

301
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:53,967
It can work for the Lord
as well as the devil.

302
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:57,007
Why should only
the Church of Rome have gold?

303
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:01,085
Gold, silver, idols and corruption.

304
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:02,928
When I get my gold....

305
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:04,806
-Your gold?
-...my share.

306
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:09,287
My share will build
a tabernacle to the Lord.

307
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:14,443
A temple of the true Gospel,
a whole string of 'em through the territory.

308
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:18,720
Ben, to bring this fella,
you gotta be crazier than he is.

309
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:22,006
I told you, everybody knows.
You can't keep gold a secret.

310
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:23,841
It travels in the air.

311
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:28,562
Anyway, we can use every gun we can get,
no matter who carries it.

312
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:30,648
Mackenna.

313
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:34,239
Preacher, this isn't going to be
like a walk to church on Sunday.

314
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:38,208
You might get yourself killed.
Might have to do some killing yourself.

315
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:41,406
The Lord knows
what he wants his servants to do.

316
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,638
Anyway, that gold belongs to the Apache.

317
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:49,801
It can be used for them,
to bring 'em to the Lord.

318
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:53,518
Ay, Chihuahual
He makes a good deal with his Lord.

319
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:00,487
Now we come to the last and the best.
A blind man and a kid.

320
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:03,318
I see good enough for both of us.

321
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:06,560
That old man has a better right
to be here than we have.

322
00:44:06,649 --> 00:44:07,843
Don't you know him?

323
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,441
That's Adams himself.

324
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:12,398
Adams?

325
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:17,241
That's Adams.

326
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:25,763
-You see? That's Adams.
-I see Adams.

327
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:30,368
-I don't see any gold.
-There's gold there.

328
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:34,999
More gold than you ever saw.
All the gold in the world.

329
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,244
Yeah, tell him. Tell him the story.

330
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,525
No. It's been told too many times.

331
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,399
But we're gonna take you back there.
Go on, Mr. Adams.

332
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:47,127
-Tell us.
-No.

333
00:44:54,689 --> 00:44:57,567
Well, it was the Mexican
that took us there...

334
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:01,568
...the one who was brought up
by the Apaches.

335
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:05,244
He didn't want no gold for himself.

336
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:07,762
He was afraid.

337
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:12,325
Kept talking about the old Apache spirits.

338
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:15,557
All he wanted was a string of horses.

339
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:18,720
So we gave it to him.

340
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:23,483
The way he took us there...

341
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:27,241
...twisting and turning,
and mostly by night.

342
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,199
We never knew where we were.

343
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:34,962
And at the last,
he made us put on blindfolds.

344
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:39,527
When we took 'em off...

345
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:42,838
...there it was...

346
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:47,237
...the prettiest little valley you ever saw.

347
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:54,001
Sparkling and shining in the sun.
It was just like a dream.

348
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:00,082
Indians used to live there 1,000 years ago,
maybe even more.

349
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:03,767
And gold everywhere!

350
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:07,517
The canyon wall had streaks...

351
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,124
...five yards, ten yards wide.

352
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:17,039
On the canyon floor, there were nuggets
laying all over the ground. Pure gold.

353
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:22,523
Gold dust in every clump of brush.

354
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:29,002
You couldn't put a pan in the river
without showing colour.

355
00:46:31,129 --> 00:46:35,441
Well, the first day we filled
a great big coffee pot with just nuggets.

356
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:38,206
No one could lift it.

357
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:40,599
Well, we built a shack.

358
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:43,128
Went to work.

359
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:49,483
Next thing, the Apaches were there.

360
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:53,998
They killed everyone, except me.

361
00:46:55,569 --> 00:47:00,768
Then they fixed my eyes,
and left me in the desert.

362
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:06,600
I wasn't any older than this lad here.

363
00:47:10,009 --> 00:47:12,045
Tell 'em about the nugget.

364
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:17,962
Well, when I got found...

365
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:22,722
...I still had one little nugget
in my pocket. Just a little one.

366
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:26,439
$190 it was worth.

367
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:29,642
Just a little one.

368
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:12,798
You know something? You're pretty.

369
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:17,606
I don't know if you are a boy or a girl.

370
00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:23,278
If you are a boy,
I'm going to give you a haircut.

371
00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:27,160
If you are a girl, I am going to kiss you.

372
00:48:29,649 --> 00:48:31,560
I think you are a girl.

373
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:50,362
That's Hachita.

374
00:48:58,209 --> 00:48:58,959
Soldiers!

375
00:49:29,729 --> 00:49:32,562
Now who's going to do it,
your men or mine?

376
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:36,888
-Yours. You have more to spare.
-We'll cut for it.

377
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,525
Okay. But I shuffle.

378
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,847
When we move out...

379
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,799
...you gentlemen head
straight for the Cavalry.

380
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:07,926
Tell them about Colorado.
You tell 'em I'm his prisoner.

381
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,206
What? I don't understand.
How could you be his prisoner?

382
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:15,601
-You trying to get rid of us?
-I'm trying to save your lives.

383
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:18,158
Forget about the gold, Mr. Weaver,
there isn't any.

384
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,207
-Get back to your store.
-I don't believe you. You're lying!

385
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:24,281
You know better. Get out.
A man like you has no business here.

386
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:27,122
There's good use for gold.
Do a lot for the territory.

387
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:29,803
-Forget about it. Do what I tell you.
-No.

388
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:36,961
These men have gold fever.

389
00:50:37,049 --> 00:50:38,926
Get out of this. Get to the Cavalry.

390
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,488
Mackenna.

391
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:55,124
-What is he telling you?
-The truth. I told them to go home.

392
00:50:57,609 --> 00:51:01,397
Why are you so selfish?
You can't keep it all for yourself.

393
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:05,041
Did he tell you that he killed Prairie Dog?

394
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:07,843
He burned the map,
but he knows where the canyon is.

395
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:11,080
-That's the truth.
-Well, now, that's more like it.

396
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:14,079
I never trusted you, Mackenna.

397
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:18,524
I knew it was a mistake to let the judge
talk us into making you a marshal.

398
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:22,204
A man from nowhere. A drifter.
You never were one of us.

399
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:25,566
-I cleaned up your town.
-Where's your badge now?

400
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:28,402
Marshal, did you really kill that old man?

401
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:31,522
Sure, but it was self-defence.

402
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:33,922
You're a murderer!

403
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:38,565
It's been a nice, quick trial.

404
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:40,967
When's the hanging?

405
00:51:41,129 --> 00:51:45,441
What's all this talk of hanging?
We're all friends here. All partners.

406
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,725
Inga! What are you doing here?

407
00:51:53,129 --> 00:51:54,642
Why is she here?

408
00:51:57,089 --> 00:52:00,240
I will tell you.
I will tell you the whole truth.

409
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:04,200
On our way to meet Mackenna,
when he sent for us...

410
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:08,199
...we ran out of food,
so we stopped at a little ranch.

411
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:12,079
We expected to pay, but the man...

412
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:14,887
...he starts to shoot.

413
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:19,925
So we beg, "Please, stop!"
He's crazy. He won't listen.

414
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:30,199
So we thought the best thing to do,
make her a partner, give her a full share.

415
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:33,004
Your father's dead?

416
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:37,678
But what can we do now? Nothing.

417
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,083
We'll never get another chance like this.

418
00:52:41,169 --> 00:52:43,842
-You mean it was an accident?
-I swear it.

419
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,439
I, myself, said a prayer over his grave.

420
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:50,647
Well, we can't bring him back now,
that's for sure. Right, Fuller?

421
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,522
No, we can't.

422
00:52:57,169 --> 00:52:58,807
Right, storekeeper?

423
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:02,002
I don't know. I don't know what to think.

424
00:53:03,209 --> 00:53:04,961
This isn't what I expected.

425
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:08,883
I didn't think it would be like this.
I don't know what to do.

426
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:12,963
You can get out of this, all of you,
before it's too late.

427
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:20,045
Gentlemen, forgive me, I'm a stranger here
so I haven't followed a good deal of this...

428
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:26,079
...but I do feel it would be a terrible pity
if we fell out among ourselves...

429
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:29,839
...or if we abandoned
what we all set out to accomplish.

430
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:33,642
I mean, we're embarked
on a great adventure, gentlemen.

431
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:36,687
Something that comes
only once in a lifetime.

432
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:41,485
So, I propose that we forget the past,
whatever may have occurred...

433
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,327
...and all go forward.

434
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:46,557
He's right!

435
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:51,083
Why else do you think the good God
brings us all together like this?

436
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:52,966
It's true, Padrecito?

437
00:53:53,249 --> 00:53:55,444
I have nothing to say to you.

438
00:53:56,649 --> 00:54:01,518
The Lord has his own ways
and I have my own reasons for being here.

439
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:05,846
So we agree,
Mackenna takes us to the canyon.

440
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,522
Sure, we agree.

441
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:12,521
We all agree to get rich.
We're all going to be millionaires.

442
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,762
Every one of you.

443
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:18,366
That's what you think,
and nothing else matters.

444
00:54:19,129 --> 00:54:21,279
The best man your town had
has been murdered.

445
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:24,042
And all you can say is,
"Well, we can't bring him back."

446
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:26,324
Not much of an epitaph, is it?

447
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:28,446
It's all you've got time for.

448
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:33,285
You can't see, you can't hear, you don't
want to know anything but that gold.

449
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:35,327
You're sick with it, all of you.

450
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:39,118
I started out being his prisoner
and now I've got you all on my back.

451
00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:41,604
There's no gold, no canyon.
There's nothing.

452
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:45,807
It's just a story that this old man tells
to get himself free drinks.

453
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:51,323
I'll take you there. I got no choice.

454
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:56,444
But I'll tell you this,
not many of you will be coming back.

455
00:54:58,449 --> 00:54:59,928
There is gold.

456
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:02,923
I saw it. All the gold in the world.

457
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:17,603
Come on. We're wasting time.

458
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:23,006
You know, I'm beginning not to trust you.

459
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:24,925
I trust you.

460
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:38,328
My God, after all these years, don't you
know you mount a horse on the left side?

461
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:47,405
They figured they had only one chance
of gettin' past the Cavalry...

462
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:49,241
...and they had a plan.

463
00:55:50,769 --> 00:55:53,647
They'd gotten the squaw
so drunk she couldn't talk.

464
00:55:54,689 --> 00:55:58,762
And two of Baker's men
were gonna ride her right into the camp...

465
00:55:58,849 --> 00:56:01,807
...making out they were being chased
by Apaches.

466
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:05,766
And while Hachita, Besh,
and Monkey were carryin' on...

467
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:08,807
...as though they were
a whole raidin' party...

468
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:12,001
...all the rest were gonna
take off a different way.

469
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,967
If it all went well, they'd meet up later.

470
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:17,601
That was the plan.

471
00:56:17,729 --> 00:56:21,165
And with a little bit of luck,
It just could work.

472
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,921
What's going on?

473
00:56:57,209 --> 00:56:58,608
I can't tell, sir.

474
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:12,208
Don't shoot!

475
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:24,643
It's a squaw.

476
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:26,287
Tied to the horse!

477
00:57:30,129 --> 00:57:31,608
Easy. Easy.

478
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,561
Where's the sergeant?

479
00:58:22,129 --> 00:58:24,563
Get out of the way.

480
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:28,801
All right, let go.

481
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:35,359
What the hell's going on here, Sergeant?

482
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:38,009
Pie-eyed, sir.
I'll get some black coffee into her.

483
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:40,239
Maybe we'll make some sense out of this.

484
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:43,441
All right, the party's over.
Get back to your posts, all of you.

485
00:58:43,529 --> 00:58:45,440
Do you hear me? Move!

486
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:16,800
So now they were all together.

487
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:19,364
The good citizens and the outlaws...

488
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:22,200
...and Mackenna and the girl.

489
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:27,040
They made for the waterhole
at the old Brogan ranch...

490
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:31,281
...because it was the last chance
to fill up before they hit the desert.

491
00:59:33,129 --> 00:59:37,520
The Apaches had burnt out the old
Brogan place about five years before.

492
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:41,839
Nobody ever took it over
because it was too far out.

493
00:59:43,689 --> 00:59:47,523
But everybody knew about
the waterhole, and everybody used it.

494
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:52,402
It was kind of neutral territory.

495
01:00:04,649 --> 01:00:05,968
It's the Cavalry!

496
01:00:06,089 --> 01:00:08,205
We're surrounded. It's the Cavalry!

497
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:11,921
I'm Judge Fuller!

498
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:14,247
You're making a mistake.

499
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:16,442
I'm Judge Fuller!

500
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:18,442
I'm editor of the Gazette!

501
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:29,520
I've captured Colorado!

502
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:32,880
Don't shoot! I've captured Colorado!

503
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:35,367
Don't shoot!

504
01:01:39,649 --> 01:01:42,561
I've got old man Adams here.
Don't shoot, please!

505
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:27,199
Riding in this country without a gun?

506
01:02:28,769 --> 01:02:29,997
Very reckless.

507
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:34,439
I knew we could depend on you.

508
01:04:04,609 --> 01:04:05,724
Miss?

509
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,208
Leave her alone.

510
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:15,848
I mean leave her.

511
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:19,881
No. We're back to the way things were.

512
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:23,324
You gave her to me, don't you remember?

513
01:04:24,049 --> 01:04:26,882
We're short of water
and she's slowing us up.

514
01:04:29,009 --> 01:04:30,442
So leave her.

515
01:04:42,009 --> 01:04:44,159
-Get out of the way.
-No.

516
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:57,839
I'm not much good to you dead.

517
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:02,605
Has it crossed your mind that
you'll never see that canyon if you kill me?

518
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:06,642
I won't kill you, but I'll hurt you awful bad.

519
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:09,600
So get out of the way.

520
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:13,725
There's plenty of water.

521
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:16,519
Less than two hours from here.

522
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:20,241
Are you crazy?

523
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:23,198
Just keep your eye on the dealer.

524
01:06:07,489 --> 01:06:08,524
You're good.

525
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:11,447
You're really good.

526
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:15,648
-For this I give you Monkey's share.
-Yeah.

527
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:26,521
Come on, enjoy!

528
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:45,480
Mr. Mackenna, I want to thank you...

529
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:47,762
...for everything.

530
01:06:48,009 --> 01:06:49,647
That's all right.

531
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:53,765
Your father and I never had
much to say to each other...

532
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:55,441
...but he was a good man.

533
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:57,281
That's lucky for me.

534
01:07:28,569 --> 01:07:32,687
Excuse me, but is there something
between you and that Indian girl?

535
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,198
No.

536
01:07:34,929 --> 01:07:36,920
There was a long time ago.

537
01:07:37,649 --> 01:07:41,403
Then after I got the marshal's job,
I had to go out and collect her brother.

538
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:43,286
Then he got himself hanged.

539
01:07:43,889 --> 01:07:46,528
Don't make her mad. She's kind of crazy.

540
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,360
Why aren't you married?

541
01:07:58,129 --> 01:08:02,122
I guess I never found a man
who could hold a candle to my father.

542
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:04,248
I guess not.

543
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:07,602
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You like to be dirty?

544
01:08:12,209 --> 01:08:15,167
Show you a new way
to get your clothes clean.

545
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:28,607
I'll never understand the gringo, never.

546
01:09:58,889 --> 01:10:00,038
It's all your fault.

547
01:10:00,649 --> 01:10:03,721
You know Hesh-ke.
You know she has a terrible temper.

548
01:11:40,969 --> 01:11:45,247
I'm sorry. If Hesh-ke's got her mind
made up to kill that girl, she'll do it.

549
01:11:45,329 --> 01:11:48,082
You gave her to me
and I don't want her damaged.

550
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:50,884
I can't watch her every minute.

551
01:12:44,449 --> 01:12:47,964
What's the matter with you?
We've got enough partners now.

552
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:51,885
Besides, this will keep those Apache
happy for awhile.

553
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:55,922
Some scout.

554
01:14:32,289 --> 01:14:35,725
The man leading that Cavalry patrol
was Sergeant Tibbs.

555
01:14:36,489 --> 01:14:40,846
"Foxy" Tibbs his men called him.
He knew his way around.

556
01:14:51,889 --> 01:14:56,883
Old "Foxy" Tibbs and his eight men
just kept followin' on.

557
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:10,279
At the end of the first day,
he sent two men back to the company...

558
01:15:10,369 --> 01:15:13,327
...so they could show
the lieutenant the trail.

559
01:15:13,729 --> 01:15:20,521
And every day after, he kept sending
two more men back, in kind of a relay.

560
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:27,441
And he hung on their heels, fast or slow.

561
01:15:34,769 --> 01:15:39,320
Finally, it was five against five.

562
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,484
You two in the back, get going.

563
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:33,364
Good.

564
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:37,003
Now we can double back
and take them one by one.

565
01:16:37,089 --> 01:16:38,920
Yeah, that's good.

566
01:16:39,209 --> 01:16:42,201
When they see us comin',
they can turn around...

567
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:46,202
...and lead us right back into the arms
of the whole company two by two.

568
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:49,807
Of course, they won't hang me.

569
01:16:54,289 --> 01:16:58,567
Now I'll tell you what you can do.
Send the girl back to the troopers.

570
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:03,000
-Why?
-Well, for one thing, she holds us up.

571
01:17:03,089 --> 01:17:06,968
They wouldn't be able to keep up with us
if they had her on their hands.

572
01:17:08,409 --> 01:17:09,637
No.

573
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:13,447
All right.
You've probably got a better idea.

574
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:19,839
No. I have no better idea.

575
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:25,166
-Only this one better work.
-It'll work.

576
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:28,207
-I'll tell her.
-Sure, you tell her.

577
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,285
-I can tell her.
-I know.

578
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:37,803
Miss.

579
01:17:38,409 --> 01:17:42,163
You're free to go over there and
join the soldiers. They'll get you home.

580
01:17:42,249 --> 01:17:44,638
It wouldn't be fair
to leave you here all alone.

581
01:17:44,729 --> 01:17:47,243
He's not alone. He's got me.

582
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,405
I think I should stay, Mr. Mackenna.

583
01:17:50,489 --> 01:17:53,367
Look, lady,
you'd better go before I change my mind.

584
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:56,327
I'll come by for supper
some night when I get back.

585
01:17:56,449 --> 01:17:57,677
Now git!

586
01:18:22,089 --> 01:18:25,126
Stay here. And keep your eyes open.

587
01:19:26,609 --> 01:19:29,077
Well, that gets rid of her, anyway.

588
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:58,520
You've had a hard time, Miss Bergerman.
You have my sympathy.

589
01:19:58,609 --> 01:20:03,285
Thank you. Sergeant, you will be able
to do something about Mr. Mackenna?

590
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:05,647
Yes, I think I can.

591
01:20:19,809 --> 01:20:22,323
Now there were only four of them left.

592
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:25,806
That made the odds a little better
for Mackenna.

593
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:29,208
Only thing was Hesh-ke had ideas.

594
01:20:29,849 --> 01:20:31,885
She wanted Mackenna back now.

595
01:20:34,049 --> 01:20:38,327
And now the girl was gone,
she figured there was nothin' to stop her.

596
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,403
Thanks.

597
01:21:13,049 --> 01:21:15,768
Mackenna, don't make her mad.

598
01:21:24,609 --> 01:21:26,804
Colorado, someone comes.

599
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:46,121
Stop! Now!

600
01:21:48,929 --> 01:21:51,079
Take it easy. I'm coming in.

601
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:54,642
Take it slow.

602
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:08,007
Stay where you are.

603
01:22:10,609 --> 01:22:14,363
I've come to join up.
I hope there won't be any trouble about it.

604
01:22:15,249 --> 01:22:17,444
-You expect us to believe that?
-Don't!

605
01:22:17,529 --> 01:22:21,238
He's a murderer.
He killed two men, his own men.

606
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,002
That's right.

607
01:22:23,249 --> 01:22:25,717
That's right.
That means I have two extra horses.

608
01:22:25,809 --> 01:22:29,722
Good horses. They'll come in
real handy when we find the gold.

609
01:22:31,009 --> 01:22:34,365
Oh, yes, the little lady here
told me all about it.

610
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,725
Of course, I already had
a pretty good idea from the squaw.

611
01:22:40,209 --> 01:22:42,882
All right. But you're a foolish man.

612
01:22:43,089 --> 01:22:46,525
Suppose we say okay now and sometime
in the night we change our minds?

613
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:49,203
Tonight, tomorrow night,
you got to sleep sometime.

614
01:22:49,289 --> 01:22:52,759
I'll get my sleep.
There's no point in your killing me.

615
01:22:53,129 --> 01:22:55,438
Not for one share, more or less.

616
01:22:55,689 --> 01:22:58,249
-Besides, you need me.
-Oh, no.

617
01:22:58,329 --> 01:23:01,287
We don't need you.
We've got enough trouble without you.

618
01:23:01,369 --> 01:23:05,328
The Army'll be looking for you. They'd be
more anxious to hang you than me.

619
01:23:05,409 --> 01:23:09,721
No. They'll think you did it, or Apache,
and I was taken prisoner.

620
01:23:10,089 --> 01:23:12,842
During all this time
that I've been chasing you around...

621
01:23:12,929 --> 01:23:16,126
...I've thought it all out.
Yeah, you do need me.

622
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:21,604
You know how much gold weighs?
You especially, Mr. Mackenna.

623
01:23:21,969 --> 01:23:25,166
How much is there? $1,000,000?
More? ln raw gold.

624
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:27,924
There's not enough of us here
to carry it out.

625
01:23:28,009 --> 01:23:31,638
But with me, you've got a better chance
of getting there and out alive.

626
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:37,445
You're right, Sergeant.
You're welcome, Sergeant.

627
01:23:38,369 --> 01:23:40,325
Coffee for the sergeant.

628
01:23:42,049 --> 01:23:45,485
Only don't forget, I'm the captain.

629
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:52,368
A sergeant who kills
two of his own troopers.

630
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:55,202
-What do you think of that?
-Not a hell of a lot.

631
01:23:55,769 --> 01:24:00,240
Now, be reasonable, Mackenna.
Oh, thank you.

632
01:24:00,609 --> 01:24:05,125
After all, a man of my age and rank,
there's no future for me in the Army.

633
01:24:05,409 --> 01:24:06,967
Do you mind, Sergeant?

634
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:10,123
Why don't you stay
with your new partners?

635
01:24:11,529 --> 01:24:14,327
No hard feelings I hope, Miss Bergerman.

636
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:24,882
Easy, friend.

637
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:29,159
Mackenna's too precious to me.

638
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:36,247
Miss Bergerman?

639
01:24:37,849 --> 01:24:41,808
Could it be that she's the little girl
of my old friend, the judge?

640
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:47,402
Mackenna, we'll never be true friends
if you keep secrets from me.

641
01:24:51,529 --> 01:24:52,803
Let's go.

642
01:25:25,529 --> 01:25:29,602
To get away from the Cavalry,
they headed for the ferry on Yellow River.

643
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:32,647
They figured they could cross over
on the raft there...

644
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:34,959
...and then double back on the trail later.

645
01:25:35,049 --> 01:25:36,846
But what they didn't know was...

646
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:40,922
...that the Apaches had taken over
the whole Yellow River territory.

647
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:23,844
And there was another thing
they didn't know:

648
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,602
Some other Apaches
had already burned down the ferry.

649
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:30,204
But they had been in a hurry,
and the raft was still afloat.

650
01:26:30,369 --> 01:26:32,041
They still had a chance.

651
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:04,923
Help me! The current's too strong!

652
01:31:08,089 --> 01:31:09,681
Get out of here!

653
01:31:23,209 --> 01:31:24,847
Damn Prairie Dog!

654
01:31:26,249 --> 01:31:29,605
And don't you go saying
we ought to take him with us.

655
01:31:46,169 --> 01:31:47,921
All right, let's go.

656
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:50,689
Now they were there. They'd reached it.

657
01:32:51,409 --> 01:32:55,118
They'd reached the place
Mackenna knew as Shaking Rock.

658
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:00,642
We're here.

659
01:33:07,609 --> 01:33:09,201
Where's the canyon?

660
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:13,485
Tomorrow. At sunrise.

661
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:15,918
Who says?

662
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:19,368
The map says.

663
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:07,126
-You nervous?
-No. Just thinking.

664
01:34:07,969 --> 01:34:09,243
Mackenna.

665
01:34:10,649 --> 01:34:15,769
-So we'll get into that canyon tomorrow--
-Not we, Sergeant. I'm not going in.

666
01:34:16,129 --> 01:34:17,278
Maybe.

667
01:34:18,009 --> 01:34:21,479
You might change your mind.
And you know as well as I do...

668
01:34:21,569 --> 01:34:24,800
...that Colorado's not going to share
the gold with anybody.

669
01:34:24,889 --> 01:34:26,959
You've had time to figure that out?

670
01:34:27,049 --> 01:34:31,804
Enough. Now look, Mackenna,
you and I, we ought to stick together.

671
01:34:32,489 --> 01:34:35,162
The way you stuck to your two soldiers?

672
01:34:53,089 --> 01:34:57,401
Well, this is where the map ends.
I expect you to keep your word.

673
01:34:59,889 --> 01:35:02,119
Show me the canyon and I will.

674
01:35:02,209 --> 01:35:06,088
Well, if it's anywhere around here,
you'll see it tomorrow morning.

675
01:35:06,369 --> 01:35:09,247
I want my guns. And I want the girl.

676
01:35:09,969 --> 01:35:10,958
Tomorrow.

677
01:35:11,049 --> 01:35:14,200
And if there's no gold,
I still get the guns and the girl.

678
01:35:17,449 --> 01:35:18,928
There is gold.

679
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:24,085
You'll never know
if you shove that thing any farther.

680
01:35:26,569 --> 01:35:28,799
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

681
01:35:37,849 --> 01:35:40,682
What'll you do with it? Your share, I mean.

682
01:35:41,889 --> 01:35:43,402
That's my business.

683
01:35:44,649 --> 01:35:45,968
Well, all right.

684
01:35:46,329 --> 01:35:48,160
I know what you think.

685
01:35:49,929 --> 01:35:54,445
One big drunk in every stinking saloon
in Sonora, till it's all gone.

686
01:35:55,409 --> 01:35:59,527
-Is that all you think I want?
-That's the way it's always been with you.

687
01:35:59,769 --> 01:36:03,079
Sure, because there was never enough
for what I really want.

688
01:36:03,169 --> 01:36:08,926
But when I get the gold, they'll never see
Colorado around here again. Never.

689
01:36:10,169 --> 01:36:12,046
Good. Where will you go?

690
01:36:14,889 --> 01:36:15,878
Sorry.

691
01:36:21,129 --> 01:36:24,758
Maybe I will tell you. But if you laugh....

692
01:36:26,289 --> 01:36:27,278
I won't laugh.

693
01:37:13,289 --> 01:37:15,405
A millionaire in Paris.

694
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:19,881
That's right.

695
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:03,762
What is it?

696
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:08,520
Well, for whatever it's worth, he says
he's going to let us go tomorrow morning.

697
01:38:08,809 --> 01:38:12,279
I don't know what's going to happen,
but from the minute you wake up...

698
01:38:12,369 --> 01:38:13,882
...you keep your eye on me.

699
01:38:13,969 --> 01:38:16,688
However it goes,
we're gonna have to move fast.

700
01:38:16,769 --> 01:38:19,602
Do we have to?
Can't we see the gold first?

701
01:38:20,889 --> 01:38:24,928
-There isn't any gold.
-But there was a map.

702
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:29,681
You saw it. It brought us here. You said
we could see the canyon in the morning.

703
01:38:29,769 --> 01:38:32,602
-I heard you.
-I said a lot of things to keep us alive.

704
01:38:32,689 --> 01:38:37,399
I've been running the bluff of my life.
And tomorrow morning is the showdown.

705
01:38:37,969 --> 01:38:41,245
But we've come so far.
And then not even to see it.

706
01:38:42,169 --> 01:38:44,683
No, listen, my father wasn't rich.

707
01:38:45,089 --> 01:38:49,446
After my mother died, I wasn't only
his daughter, I was his ranch hand...

708
01:38:49,569 --> 01:38:52,208
...because we couldn't afford to keep one.

709
01:38:53,529 --> 01:38:58,159
But with my share,
I could buy a real ranch, a big one.

710
01:38:58,649 --> 01:39:01,880
If I had your place,
I wouldn't be the marshal for five minutes.

711
01:39:01,969 --> 01:39:03,163
You don't have to.

712
01:39:03,249 --> 01:39:05,809
With your share,
you can do anything you want to.

713
01:39:05,889 --> 01:39:08,244
You like to gamble.
Build a gambling house.

714
01:39:08,329 --> 01:39:11,127
-I'll be your partner.
-You're out of your mind.

715
01:39:11,209 --> 01:39:15,487
Now, wake up! Your share, my share,
there aren't going to be any shares.

716
01:39:15,569 --> 01:39:18,367
I know him.
He doesn't share with anybody.

717
01:39:30,289 --> 01:39:31,483
I'm sorry.

718
01:39:34,049 --> 01:39:35,767
I must be crazy.

719
01:39:37,849 --> 01:39:40,488
You've done so much for me. Everything.

720
01:39:41,889 --> 01:39:43,845
And I'm nothing but trouble.

721
01:39:46,369 --> 01:39:48,564
I don't know why you bother with me.

722
01:39:53,449 --> 01:39:56,566
I have to. We're partners.

723
01:41:30,049 --> 01:41:33,758
-Well, what happens?
-I never would have believed it.

724
01:41:35,969 --> 01:41:39,848
I think you're gonna see that canyon
in about a minute.

725
01:41:42,569 --> 01:41:45,447
-My guns.
-No, not until I see the canyon.

726
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:50,242
All right. Look at the rock.

727
01:41:50,849 --> 01:41:52,521
Watch that shadow.

728
01:42:08,769 --> 01:42:11,203
-What makes this?
-I don't know.

729
01:42:11,969 --> 01:42:14,005
Might be a quartz deposit.

730
01:42:26,249 --> 01:42:27,238
Look!

731
01:42:30,009 --> 01:42:31,283
Come on!

732
01:43:05,809 --> 01:43:07,003
Up there!

733
01:46:42,929 --> 01:46:45,807
Mackenna! Look! I'm covered in gold.

734
01:46:45,889 --> 01:46:49,006
-Come on. We're getting out.
-Getting out? No, why?

735
01:46:49,089 --> 01:46:52,365
Listen to me. If we don't get away,
we're going to be killed.

736
01:46:52,449 --> 01:46:56,408
We're not staying, not for all the gold
in the world. So start climbing.

737
01:47:29,849 --> 01:47:32,841
No. No bullets. I take them all.

738
01:47:34,009 --> 01:47:35,567
-When?
-Last night.

739
01:47:35,849 --> 01:47:37,805
The spirits tell me what to do.

740
01:47:38,849 --> 01:47:42,683
This is Apache gold. They tell me...

741
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:45,680
...kill everyone today.

742
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:49,086
Even you, Colorado. You are not Apache.

743
01:48:48,289 --> 01:48:49,642
Don't look down.

744
01:48:50,089 --> 01:48:53,286
Keep going! Climb!

745
01:48:56,849 --> 01:48:59,238
Come on, keep going.

746
01:49:38,049 --> 01:49:40,358
Come on. Just a little further.

747
01:49:41,209 --> 01:49:42,403
You can do it.

748
01:49:45,729 --> 01:49:47,879
Come on, try. A little bit more.

749
01:50:07,049 --> 01:50:08,038
Come on.

750
01:50:11,049 --> 01:50:12,277
Come on, climb.

751
01:50:13,089 --> 01:50:14,408
Climb. Come on.

752
01:50:15,209 --> 01:50:16,358
I can't.

753
01:50:16,489 --> 01:50:17,319
Try!

754
01:51:17,689 --> 01:51:20,283
Goodbye, old friend. No more jokes.

755
01:52:15,009 --> 01:52:16,044
Mackenna!

756
02:00:41,849 --> 02:00:43,248
Goodbye, Mackenna.

757
02:00:44,849 --> 02:00:46,760
You know I'm coming after you.

758
02:00:50,249 --> 02:00:52,080
Stay away from me, Mackenna.

759
02:00:55,329 --> 02:00:59,083
Find a hole, old friend. Make it deep.

760
