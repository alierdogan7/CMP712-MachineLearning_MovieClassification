as being rich men, wouldn't you?

915
01:11:47,517 --> 01:11:49,901
Only if you get out with it.

916
01:11:49,903 --> 01:11:53,154
Ain't no boat coming till the river thaws.

917
01:11:53,156 --> 01:11:56,640
Don't know if I can wait four
months to get out of this hole.

[Scoffs]

919
01:11:57,994 --> 01:12:00,361
Four months of fighting off
sons of bitches like Sundown.

920
01:12:00,363 --> 01:12:02,080
Fighting for wood.

921
01:12:02,082 --> 01:12:03,948
Fighting off mother nature.

923
01:12:06,336 --> 01:12:09,120
I'm tired of fighting, Bill.

924
01:12:09,122 --> 01:12:10,755
I just want to go.

925
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:14,825
Then let's do it.

926
01:12:17,012 --> 01:12:18,262
What, now?

927
01:12:18,264 --> 01:12:20,681
Now.

928
01:12:25,687 --> 01:12:29,524
- Overland?
- Overland.

929
01:12:29,526 --> 01:12:32,343
Huh. That's suicide.

930
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:34,512
Only if it kills you.

[Chuckles]

932
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:40,151
I knew I liked you, Bill.

933
01:12:40,153 --> 01:12:43,454
There just ain't no "no" in you.

934
01:12:43,456 --> 01:12:48,159
Might be the finest compliment
anyone's ever paid me.

936
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:18,239
I'm headed out, brother.

937
01:13:20,241 --> 01:13:22,443
I wish I was taking you with me.

938
01:13:22,445 --> 01:13:24,831
I guess I am, in a way.

939
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:32,203
We were richer, then, weren't we?

940
01:13:32,205 --> 01:13:35,239
When we had nothing in our pockets,

941
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:37,074
just a head full of hope.

942
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:43,798
That's what I'll carry...

943
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,552
what we were in that moment in time.

944
01:13:47,554 --> 01:13:49,554
Worth more than anything

945
01:13:49,556 --> 01:13:52,974
any man could ever pull out of the ground.

946
01:13:53,026 --> 01:13:56,477
You watch over me.

947
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,946

for the death of my friend,

951
01:14:51,768 --> 01:14:53,601

952

Oh, they got the right guy.

953
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:59,240
He murdered a mountie.

954
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:02,860
Justice will be served.

955
01:15:02,862 --> 01:15:04,728
Tlingit might disagree.

956
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,418
You're a worldly man, Father,

957
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:14,789
but sometimes justice doesn't
just need to be justice.

958
01:15:14,791 --> 01:15:18,509
Sometimes justice needs to be seen.

959
01:15:18,511 --> 01:15:22,463
Pity you, killing for another man's agenda.

960
01:15:22,465 --> 01:15:23,965
No.

961
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:26,384
You put two of my men in the ground.

962
01:15:26,386 --> 01:15:29,520
And I lost men, as well.

963
01:15:29,522 --> 01:15:31,973
Who wins?

964
01:15:36,144 --> 01:15:38,312
Perhaps they've killed us both.

968
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:31,866
I heard you bought up

969
01:16:31,868 --> 01:16:34,651
everything at the dry-goods
store in preparation.

970
01:16:34,653 --> 01:16:38,172
It turns out gold has some uses, after all.

971
01:16:38,174 --> 01:16:41,625
Come with me.

972
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:47,264
Is that some sort of proposal, Mr. Haskell?

in the Fairview Hotel...

982
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:25,336
Sell it.

983
01:17:25,338 --> 01:17:28,889
Hell, [Bag thuds] I'll buy it from you.

985
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:34,678
That makes exactly no sense, Haskell.

Who gives a God damn about sense?
