From what?
From whom?

24
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,594
There was an incident in the saloon.

Mr. Bohannon killed one of our men

a negro in the saloon?

00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,543
What?
You heard me.

183
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,089
I don't want no dead man's trade.

184
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,027
Last I saw you, you barely
escaped a neck stretchin',

185
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:46,430
and you ride on outta
here and I figured

186
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:48,598
for certain they got you killed.

187
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,200
Now you come back,

188
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,725
traipsin' on in here
like you own the place?

189
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:55,728
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

190
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:01,010
I am happy to see you, idiot.

191
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:02,401
I just said so.

192
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,577
Now, gimme that damn dollar.

193
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,763
How's your father?

194
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,675
Very weak.

195
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,685
You'll have to tend to him.

196
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:37,447
Where are you going?

197
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,772
I'm going to help
them find my brother.

198
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:43,776
Your own brother?

199
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:47,280
He has to be stopped
before he starts a war.

200
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,910
Be careful... Joseph.

201
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,382
Will you just look at that?

202
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:54,305
An Injun, a nigger, and a Greyback.

203
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,558
We got ourselves a rainbow, boys.

204
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,731
Mount up.

205
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,329
Hyah!

206
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:50,714
{pub}There's no reason to panic, Lily.

207
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,384
I'm not, Thomas.

208
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,533
I'm simply moving out.

209
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:02,081
But... where will you go?

210
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,830
I still have our tent,
Robert's and mine.

211
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,465
I'll find a spot.

212
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,168
Are you mad?

213
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:12,091
Living amongst that rabble?

214
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,640
And we're under a threat
of an Indian attack.

215
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,109
It's too dangerous.
I won't have it.

216
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,223
That's not your decision to make.

217
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:24,562
Oh. I see.

218
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:32,069
I thought it significant that you
chose to come back here with me,

219
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:35,698
but... I see I was mistaken.

220
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,400
I came back because I believe in you.

221
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:42,060
I believe in this railroad.

222
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,708
Together we can get it done.

223
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,420
But not together.

224
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,259
I'm sorry.

225
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,887
Hmm. So am I.

226
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:04,227
Taking you in...
Comforting you,

227
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,030
salving the memory
of Robert at every turn.

228
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:10,399
And for that I am eternally grateful.

229
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:15,696
Please, Thomas... can
we end this amiably?

230
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,914
You played me like
a fiddle, didn't you?

231
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,418
Right under my nose...

232
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,187
Where I could see you,
hear your voice,

233
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:32,880
smell you every day.

234
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,346
I should go.

235
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:45,226
Ahem. Could you have Henri
help me with my things?

236
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,396
No.

237
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,234
Carry them yourself.

238
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,757
Hold!

239
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:38,863
We follow Little Bear Creek North
for a day and then head West.

240
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,990
How many in your father's camp?

241
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,202
50, maybe 60.

242
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:47,495
Mostly women and children.

243
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,998
Hmm.

244
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,668
Where are all the braves?

245
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,837
Out hunting.

246
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,797
And what about this Pawnee killer?

247
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,217
My father will know where he is.

248
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,887
He better.

249
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,311
Think that was smart tellin' him

250
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,857
there's only women and
children at that camp?

251
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:15,792
What do you mean?

252
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,444
What if your father don't
give up Pawnee killer?

253
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,532
Lieutenant Griggs
gave me his guarantee.

254
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,535
So the white man gave
you his word, huh?

255
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,212
Lieutenant?

256
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,465
How we doing?

257
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:41,842
Fine.

258
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:44,845
Is that a Confederate Sabre
you got on your belt there?

259
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,932
Ha ha ha.
Yes, it is.

260
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:50,559
Where'd you get it?

261
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:53,312
Antietam.

262
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,356
Spoils of victory.

263
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,734
You call Sharpsburg a victory?

264
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:05,032
Antietam. And yeah, I do,
a glorious one.

265
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:08,301
Mount up!

266
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,614
[Indistinct chatter]

267
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:48,993
That'll be 6 bits.

268
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,829
6 bits?

269
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:56,194
75 cents, unless, uh...

270
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,896
Unless you got
something else in mind.

271
00:22:59,021 --> 00:22:59,837
OK.

272
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,923
What are you doing?

273
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,704
You can put it on my account.

274
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:08,173
All right, Eva. I'll be
back for it later.

275
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:11,056
You know where I'll be. Now fly.

276
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,896
Thank you.

277
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,974
I'll pay you back.

278
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,385
When?

279
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:27,090
I, uh, I have a small purse of...

280
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:29,293
Of coins somewhere.

281
00:23:29,418 --> 00:23:32,077
Yeah, don't worry about it for now.

282
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,997
First thing I'd do...
Is get you a carpenter

283
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,390
to lay you some floor boards.

284
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,936
Otherwise, you'll be saying
hello to Mr. trench foot.

285
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:41,472
I'm well acquainted with trench foot.

286
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:44,576
I have spent a year
in the wilderness.

287
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:49,114
I reckon you're a good sight tougher
than you look, ain't you, Mrs. Bell?

288
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,648
Please. Lily.

289
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,216
All right then, Lily...

290
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:56,120
I'd still suggest you puttin'
in them floor boards, though.

291
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:57,936
'Course I had to throw my leg

292
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:02,066
over that cross-eyed carpenter
twice before he got mine right.

293
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:13,368
Tell us about your glorious
victory at Sharpsburg, lieutenant.

294
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:21,469
Antietam it is then.

295
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,456
I s with the 51st Pennsylvania.

296
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:33,972
Me and my boys
took the Burnside Bridge.

297
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:38,852
We softened them Rebs up with
a light howitzer from the East Bank.

298
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:42,501
Then we stormed that bridge
like hounds from hell.

299
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,817
Shoulda seen them Greybacks run.

300
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:47,528
Ha ha. Yes, sir.

301
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:50,823
Them boys got the skinny end
of the horn that day.

302
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:55,994
I was on the other side
of the bridge that day.

303
00:24:58,276 --> 00:24:59,748
Is that so?

304
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:03,446
Yep.

305
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:08,257
You want to know why we retreated?

306
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,463
We was out of ammunition...

307
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:13,554
From killin' Yankees.

308
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:16,135
Now, don't get me wrong,

309
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,164
they were some brave men. Brave men.

310
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,810
General McClellan might
just as well have been

311
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,079
sending 'em up
against a firing squad.

312
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:31,318
They kept chargin'
and... we kept shootin',

313
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,116
like fish in a bloody barrel.

314
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:38,057
Time we was done,

315
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:41,165
there was a bridge of bodies
'cross that river.

316
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,330
Yeah.

317
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:46,456
That must have been when
you finally come across.

318
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,840
When all the killin' was done.

319
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,302
Yeah.

320
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,844
We must've put down
500 Yankees that day.

321
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,137
So.

322
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,976
You want to call that
a glorious victory...

323
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,648
You go ahead.

324
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:11,653
500...

325
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:14,195
A thousand...

326
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,365
10,000.

327
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,366
It doesn't matter.

328
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:20,204
Hey!

329
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,039
Hey.

330
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,873
We won.

331
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,379
Ha ha.
And you lost.

332
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:33,926
And I got the sword
right here to prove it.

333
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,940
Yeah.

334
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,109
Well...

335
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,487
I guess I'm just
gonna have to take it

336
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:43,822
off of you and shove
it up your ass, then.

337
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:45,312
Yeah. Is that so?

338
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:47,731
Listen to me.

339
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:50,692
Listen to me.

340
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:54,623
Sometimes you got to bite
the tongue and just take it.

341
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,141
[Man screaming]

342
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,525
Jesus.

343
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,894
Get up! Hey, hey, get up!

344
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,229
Jensen!

345
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:26,853
[Man screaming]

346
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:27,980
Jensen!

347
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,657
Jensen!

348
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:04,891
Oh, sweet Jesus.

349
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:27,649
They took the horses.

350
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,096
Damn it to hell.

351
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,670
That damned father
of yours is pretty clever,

352
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,433
I'll give him that much.

353
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:37,090
My father had nothing
to do with this.

354
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:40,205
[Sighs]
It was my brother.

355
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,174
Your brother?

356
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,342
This is his work.

357
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,945
What we saw out there, too.

358
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,647
This bloody renegade is your brother

359
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:50,816
and you expect me to act
fairly with your father?

360
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:54,024
Hey! We got more important problems,

361
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,859
as in we got no horses.

362
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,389
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

363
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,124
Cullen: We need to turn
around and go back.

364
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:02,061
Griggs: The plan's unchanged.
We march into the village.

365
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:06,244
March? Are you crazy or just stupid?

366
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,002
You are welcome
to retreat, Mr. Bohannon.

367
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:12,338
We don't need you.
Let's move out.

368
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:14,797
Off the reel, gentlemen.

369
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,677
We need to go back.

370
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:21,246
Following this guy's
gonna be suicide.

371
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:24,782
No. We split up,
we'll be easier targets.

372
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:27,015
It's what my brother wants.

373
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:38,110
Hey. Hey!

374
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,821
I need to know
where you stand right now.

375
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,656
How you mean?

376
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,104

a rear guard action,

377
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:46,506
trying to buy some
time for his village,

378
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:47,953
which means they ain't left yet.

379
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,342
What if we get there and
them Injuns still here?

380
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,146
Griggs ain't gonna be in no
talkin' mood, that's for sure.

381
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,794
Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna
kill no women and no children.

382
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,740
You just be ready.

383
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:02,110
We might end up finding them blue
coats instead of the Cheyenne.

384
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,111
{pub}Father?

385
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,447
I brought you some soup.

386
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:43,383
Mother told me this was
always your one true love.

387
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:51,350
I was only little...
But I remember the screaming at night.

388
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:55,479
I remember the bruises
on her face in the morning.

389
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:03,528
After you left,
she was always afraid you'd come back...

390
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:08,493
But never stopped praying you would.

391
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,914
She never stopped loving you.

392
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:23,423
Have you nothing to say?

393
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:27,680
Leave me alone.

394
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:33,099
No. You're the one
who leaves, remember?

395
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:37,956
Here. Let me.

396
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:43,295
Here, drink it.

397
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,830
I am not my mother.

398
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:01,481
I'm not afraid of you.

399
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:24,338
What the hell are you up to, son?

400
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:25,607
What do you mean?

401
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,375
This is just a different
bend in the same river.

402
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,911
Skirted it twice, now
back out and back in.

403
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,646
The Pawnee killer would have
had time to tell your father

404
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,302
about the derailment by now.

405
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,118
You're just buying time for
your village to escape, ain't ya?

406
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:36,181
What do you care?

407
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:38,020
You gonna get the rest of us killed

408

out here leadin' us in circles.

409
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,311
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

410
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:45,159
So you never intended to go
after Pawnee killer, did you?

411
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:47,261
That's not true.

412
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:49,694
I just wanted to make sure
my family was safe first.

You're just wasting ammunition.

420
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:12,019
Why ain't they attacking us?

421
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:13,921
They will.

422

I give my patooty a rest.

Ohh.

The ladies call me deuce...

431

Because I got two of 'em.

Everybody stares at my
tattoos... but nobody asks.

435

And yeah, it don't wipe off.

436
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:32,547
Yes, I...I heard you
were captured by Indians.

It was a sunny day.

440
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:42,843
They hacked up my mom
and dad, scalped 'em.

441
00:35:42,968 --> 00:35:46,480
Raped my little sister
and smashed her brains out with rocks.

You gonna eat that?

443

No, please.

Had the pox.

446
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,665
They wouldn't touch me.
Traded me off to some Mojave.

447
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,170
They was a cake walk compared to
what the Yavapai would have been.

About the Indian I killed.

450
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,980
It's because his spirit's wandering.

451
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,843
It's reaching out to you.

452
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:22,685

Don't let him get you.

the path to the dead world.

Mr. Durant, Bohannon is a killer.

I can prove it. Look at these
papers I found in his tent.

Right now Mr. Bohannon is hunting
the Indians who attacked us.

the men back to work.

so he killed Johnson.

Hmm?

us. Look at these names.

Listen to me,
half the men out there are killers.
