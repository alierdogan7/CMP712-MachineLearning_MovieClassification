1
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,090
Man: Now I can buy
the medicines I need.

2
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,263
Porter:
You wait here.

3
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,546
You'll be called in later
if there's any work for you.

4
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,322
- You've kept us waiting for three days.
- It's not fair.

5
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,706
This time you've got to let us in.

6
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,433
I'm not the boss.
I have my orders.

7
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,954
Woman:
Then have some humanity as well.

8
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,341
Yesterday we stood out here
for five hours under that sun.

9
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,756
They called the others.
Why not us?

10
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,488
Well, looks like we're heading
for a war, Sergeant.

11
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,536
They told us to expect
troop movements.

12
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,992
What more do you want?

13
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,876
If they send me into action with
all those gorgeous females... boy!

14
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,763
Sir, can I speak to you?

15
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,591
Talking to me?

16
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,557
That's right, Captain.
I'd like a word with you.

17
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,485
Now look. I'm a sergeant,
not a captain.

18
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,190
What can I do for you,
young lady?

19
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,071
Would you please
read this for me?

20
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,110
You see, I'm not sure
if they want to take me on

21
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,618
or if it says there's nothing
for me yet.

22
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,074
Is this your name here?

23
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,039
They tell me that's what's written,
only I don't know how to read.

24
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,125
Is it maybe Carmen?

25
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,666
Yes, the first name is Carmen,

26
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,426
but I don't know
why they asked you to come here.

27
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,428
I'm afraid I'm not
very much use to you.

28
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,716
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you all the same.

29
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,136
I bet you're a native
of Navarra, Valladolid, right?

30
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,770
Not far from there, anyway.

31
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,058
Oh, I knew right away that you were
from the north like me,

32
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,226
even before I heard you speak.

33
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,111
Have you been in Seville long?

34
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,398
We were all transferred
two days ago

35
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,282
from the fort in Cordova.

36
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,533
I've been here six months

37
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,241
ever since the death
of my poor mother.

38
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,539
We gypsies aren't very well liked

39
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,998
and it's difficult for us
to get regular work.

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,504
You'll get a job. I know.
I'm sure of it.

41
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,835
What are you doing tonight?

42
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,750
Maybe we could meet and you could
tell me if I brought you good luck.

43
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,965
I'm afraid that just wouldn't
be possible.

44
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,129
I live with friends, you see.

45
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,297
Ah, here's the porter.

46
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,432
You can come in now,
and hurry up about it.

47
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,791
- So they're going to take me on?
- You wait over there.

48
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,571
They'll see you with
all the other women, you understand?

49
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,075
- Thank you.
- Come on, get a move on.

50
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,407
- All right!
- No need to shout!

51
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,104
We've waited long enough!

52
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,191
Thank you, Captain.
So you brought me luck after all.

53
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,620
Phew, no wonder
they let the women undress

54
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,000
when they come to work here.

55
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,502
This place is like a furnace.

56
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,164
Hey, Sergeant, why don't we ask
permission to strip, too?

57
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,583
It's just as hot here
as it is in the factory.

58
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,422
Any gentleman feeling the heat

59
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,258
may unfasten the top button
of his jacket

60
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,718
when off duty
and out of the public eye.

61
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,304
The best of it is
when I think of all those women

62
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,595
running around half naked,
I get <i>so</i> dizzy I can't see the cards,

63
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,388
so the corporal's winning
hands down.

64
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,307
- Mind you...
- Sergeant, come quickly!

65
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,601
Those women are murdering
each other in there! Quick.

66
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,953
- Out of my way.
- Woman: You dirty witch!

67
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,105
- I'll show you!
- Silence! Silence, all of you!

68
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,415
Woman:
You're nothing but a filthy gypsy!

69
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,458
- Woman ♪2: Say that again! I dare you!
- A filthy gypsy!

70
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,029
- Silence, I say!
- A filthy witch!

71
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,536
Silence! Silence!

72
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,369
Ah! She's a filthy gypsy witch,
I tell you.

73
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,499
I know she's out for my blood!

74
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,411
- Who started it?
- She did! That gypsy started it!

75
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on, repeat what you said!

76
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,291
- Repeat it!
- You dirty whore!

77
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,549
You dirty whore!

78
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,676
- You filthy hypocrite!
- You're a whore!

79
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,839
Silence! Silence!

80
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,325
- Oh, my God, I'm dying! Help!
- Take her to the infirmary.

81
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,760
- I'm dying. She's killed me.
- The woman's hurt.

82
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,349
Liar!

83
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,434
And take that one outside.

84
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,315
Give me the knife.

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,477
I can walk on my own.

86
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,487
Let me go.
I won't run away.

87
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,614
- Let me go!
<i>_</i> Woman ♪3: Gypsy!

88
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,867
Woman ♪4: Trash!
Filthy gypsy, get out of here!

89
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,369
We don't want your kind around here.

90
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,325
Those gypsies are all alike.

91
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:30,209
First they ask for help, and then
they cause nothing but trouble.

92
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,368
Here you are.

93
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,013
Get yourself a couple of men
and take her to the police station.

94
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,710
I'll send the knife later...

95
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,499
- with the report.
- Very good, sir.

96
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,472
Oh, please,
why must we go this way?

97
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,258
What's wrong with it?

98
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,676
My friends live around here.

99
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,070
I don't want them
to see me walking

100
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,519
between those two soldiers
as if I was a rotten thief.

101
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,651
I'm afraid there is no other way
to the police station.

102
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,436
I told you
that woman started it,

103
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,104
calling me a witch
and a dirty gypsy.

104
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,350
What would you have done
if you had been in my place?

105
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,617
Oh, please, Sergeant.

106
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,829
All right, you go ahead
by yourself and we'll follow.

107
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:15,166
- You two stay further behind.
- Thank you so much, Sergeant.

108
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,590
You're right.
After all, she's not a bad kid.

109
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,753
I wouldn't say that.

110
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,890
She had been only too ready
to kill that woman, I assure you.

111
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,140
She's gone!

112
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,972
I might have known it.

113
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,661
Here. This is your food.

114
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,246
I don't want it, so you might
as well take it away.

115
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,161
Well, it's all the same to me.

116
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,931
One of your relations
has just brought you

117
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,081
some homemade bread.

118
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,091
You don't want to eat it
on its own.

119
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,093
I've no family in Seville.

120
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,426
But it was passed by the officer
of the guard in the usual way.

121
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,342
So only someone in your family
could have brought it.

122
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,603
- You know that.
- I tell you, it isn't for me.

123
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,856
Leave me in peace, Pedro.

124
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,561
I know how you're feeling, Jose,

125
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,284
and things are going
to get much rougher

126
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,647
before you're through with this.

127
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,562
They'll have their knives
in you, Jose.

128
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,734
However, it's only a matter of time
before you get stripes back again.

129
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,959
Carmen:
Hello there, Sergeant!

130
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,629
Well, fancy seeing you
reduced to guard duty.

131
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,345
Oh, I know we have
some accounts to settle,

132
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,180
but don't be angry with me.

133
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,845
There's nothing we can do
about it tonight anyway.

134
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,732
Come on! No point
in making a tragedy over it.

135
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,940
I want to talk to you.
Come down here.

136
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,480
It wouldn't be wise.

137
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,193
Like some of my wine?

138
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,282
There you are!

139
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,365
I pour it before your feet,
my precious.

140
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,452
Now, surely there's
something you'd like to do.

141
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,958
I'll say put you over my knee
and thrash you.

142
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,084
I was expecting
something like that.

143
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,465
All because of a couple
of silly stripes.

144
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,718
Tell me you don't like me,
but don't make a fuss over nothing.

145
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,345
That would be more honest,
don't you think?

146
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,881
Carmen!

147
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,221
Listen, If you want to thank me
for the little gift I sent you,

148
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,308
I often go down to Lillas' Place
in Triana.

149
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,472
Why don't you come
and see me there?

150
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,891
It's better for you if I don't.

151
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,606
Will you come or not?

152
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,691
I'll come.

153
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,527
Well, now I have to go
and dance again.

154
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,942
Some lucky men are kept
by the army, but not me.

155
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,781
I'm a working girl.

156
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,869
Hey, soldier, come here!

157
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,625
Straight from the cradle.

158
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,663
No, I'm sorry.

159
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,137
Jose!

160
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,350
I thought you'd never get here.

161
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,396
I'll just go and tell Lillas,
and then we can leave at once.

162
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,986
Oh, this place smells
like a fish shop!

163
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,650
Lillas, this is my sergeant

164
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,569
who defended me
at the factory that day.

165
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,578
Can you manage
without me tonight?

166
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,034
I'd like to go now.

167
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,915
All right, you run along.

168
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,202
Marvelous.
There we are. I'm ready.

169
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,888
You know, I was hoping
we'd meet again.

170
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,588
I'm so glad to see you.

171
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,215
Where are we going?

172
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,593
- To the police station.
- Oh, you're joking!

173
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,791
Did you really think
you could buy me off so easily?

174
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,921
But who wants to buy you?

175
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,556
I only wanted
to do you a kindness.

176
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,809
You helped me escape,
and we gypsies pay our debts.

177
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,595
Escaping wasn't my idea.

178
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,934
I want to see justice done,
so I'm taking you in.

179
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,896
All to put back your precious
little stripes again.

180
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,184
You're so funny!

181
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,397
Don't waste time.

182
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,862
Listen, I'm sorry
you were punished.

183
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,823
But now I'm in an even worse
position than you are,

184
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,409
because now I can never
go back to the factory.

185
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,791
And where else
can I find work these days?

186
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,496
And if you really want to know,

187
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,582
I've already been
to the police station myself

188
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,041
and I saw the colonel.

189
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,672
I got invited to his house

190
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,951
and that's how I got permission
to send you the bread.

191
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,713
I don't believe it.

192
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,258
You know, I thought
you'd have understood.

193
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,425
I wanted to see you.

194
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,062
It was silly, I know, but I believed
you wanted to see me, too.

195
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,393
Look, we're rich tonight.

196
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,036
And I was looking forward
to some fun.

197
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,064
Stay with me, won't you?

198
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,948
You know I will.
What do you think I came here for?

199
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,608
Oh, you're terrible!

200
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,902
For a moment
you really got me scared.

201
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,422
If I had wanted to arrest you,
I wouldn't have come on my own.

202
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,823
You know that.

203
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,083
Be careful
you don't drop everything.

204
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,710
Oh, I can't wait to see her face
when she sees you.

205
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,463
She's very nice, but you mustn't
rub her up the wrong way.

206
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,124
She's very touchy, you know.

207
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,591
Now remember,
let me do all the talking.

208
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,723
Dorotea! Dorotea!

209
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,679
Dorotea!
It's me, Carmen.

210
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,594
At this time of night?
What is it now?

211
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,197
Go somewhere else.
You can't come here.

212
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,573
But we've got lots of food,
Dorotea.

213
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,144
Please, don't be like that.

214
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,435
Go somewhere else.
I've had enough of your nonsense.

215
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,150
An hour, not a second longer,
I promise.

216
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,985
I've heard that before.

217
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,865
All right, bring him in.

218
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:12,036
You must try this.
It's very special.

219
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,871
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

220
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,660
And if you eat it
from my fingers,

221
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,420
something wonderful will happen.

222
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,599
You see?
It's magic.

223
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,354
You're a witch.

224
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,732
That surprise you?
I'm a gypsy.

225
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,484
I thought you knew that already.

226
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,520
If you don't like
my love potions,

227
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,689
then I shall give them
to the mosquitoes.

228
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,947
There you are.

229
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,031
Now they'll all be so busy,
they won't sting us.

230
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,319
You come here.

231
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,580
Oh, they reduce you
to a private's rank,

232
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,617
but you start ordering me around
as if you were a colonel.

233
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,877
And I obey you like a slave.

234
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,878
Tell me what to do to please you.

235
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,755
Read your palm for you?

236
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,666
Shall I?

237
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,855
Well, what have you seen?

238
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,143
Nothing.
I was pretending.

239
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,107
Kiss me please.

240
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,614
Listen, Jose.
Can you hear the music?

241
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,070
I know, I'll do
a gypsy dance for you.

242
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,952
I'll dance just for you
as if you really were a colonel.

243
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,206
It made me so sad when I saw you
all alone outside that evening.

244
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,536
I could have murdered you.

245
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,545
I'm not much of a dancer,
but nobody seems to mind.

246
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,063
You know well enough that men
don't think about your dancing

247
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,165
when they watch you.

248
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,629
Oh, really?

249
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,021
What do they think about, then?

250
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,231
Aah!

251
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,738
They think, "I've got to kiss her
to death and eat her all up!"

252
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,578
- Please!
- This time you won't escape.

253
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,947
Oh, yes, I will.

254
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,663
I know what you want,
but I shall run away.

255
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,290
That's what you think.

256
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,454
But I don't want you.

257
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,214
You're not my type.

258
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,750
You're my type, though.

259
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,214
Oh, you're squashing me!

260
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,054
Oh, please,
I have to go back soon.

261
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,391
You say you like me,

262
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,557
but you don't even dare to climb
over a barrack wall for me.

263
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,023
What'll you do for me?

264
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,802
You're still here, Sergeant.
Go away.

265
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,759
I've paid my debts
and we're all square now, aren't we?

266
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,641
Yes, I've been paid in full.

267
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,393
But it won't happen again.

268
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,145
You're beautiful,
but not beautiful enough

269
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,023
to make me ever want
to see you again.

270
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,106
And perhaps the better
for both of us.

271
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,770
I'm sorry.

272
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,282
It's such a pity.

273
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,034
It might have been good.

274
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,912
Still, it's right for you
to stay away from me.

275
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,165
You and I are from
two different worlds.

276
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,039
Jose!

277
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,002
Keep away from me.

278
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,293
I can only bring you bad luck.

279
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,428
Dorotea:
Are you two still here?

280
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,180
Hurry up and get out.

281
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,709
Good morning.

282
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,620
Well, what can I do for you?

283
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,255
I'd like to talk to Lillas, please.

284
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,836
She's not here.

285
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,476
And neither is the one
you're looking for.

286
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,628
She's in Portugal.

287
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,922
In Portugal?

288
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,854
- What do you want?
- I have to speak to Carmen.

289
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,021
I'm Jose.

290
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,530
I don't care who you are.

291
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,157
Carmen hasn't been here
for ages.

292
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,501
You'd better try somewhere else.

293
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,993
Tell me where I can find her.

294
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,574
How the hell should I know?

295
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:06,078
Jose, it's me, Carmen.

296
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,455
You mean,
you've forgotten me already?

297
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,491
I'm not very flattered.

298
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,501
Well, do you want to murder me?

299
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,957
What are you doing here?

300
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,417
I heard you were on guard,
so I came to see you.

301
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,127
Do you mind?

302
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,510
I looked for you everywhere.

303
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:24,172
- You mustn't stay here.
- All right, I won't.

304
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,261
I've got to hurry anyway.

305
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,596
I came here
to ask you something.

306
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,978
Would you like to earn
a little money on the side?

307
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,013
Then let some of my friends
pass tonight.

308
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,309
No one can pass through here.
I can't ignore orders.

309
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,944
Oh, Jose, you're such a fool.

310
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,947
You disobeyed orders when you stayed
with me at Dorotea's.

311
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,483
Oh, please do this for me,

312
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,617
and then I'll meet you again
tomorrow evening.

313
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,618
- It's impossible.
- I see.

314
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,578
I shouldn't have come.

315
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,040
The fact is,
I'm in trouble, Jose.

316
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,753
I borrowed an awful lot of money

317
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,596
and now my friends want me
to give it back.

318
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,342
But if I can do this favor for them,
they'll forget all about it.

319
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,506
Oh, I know it's wrong
to ask you, Jose,

320
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,801
but you do see my position.

321
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,595
So now it's smuggling
that you've sunk to.

322
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,138
Oh, smuggfing-

323
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,806
You're so dramatic.

324
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,852
They're just poor people
who have to earn a living, that's all.

325
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,770
But if you can't, never mind.

326
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,780
I know plenty of officers who will turn
a blind eye when it suits them.

327
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,909
They appreciate my gratitude,
which is more than you do.

328
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,445
- Sorry I asked.
- Come here!

329
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,737
You make me sick.

330
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,664
You wait till they order you
to hang yourself

331
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,166
and see how you feel then!

332
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,128
Carmen.

333
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,082
Let go of me!

334
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,841
Why won't you be reasonable?

335
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,377
I'm sick of your stinking morals.

336
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,983
The men who don't parade
their virtue

337
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,305
are the ones
who hang onto their rank.

338
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,637
What would it cost you
to do this for me?

339
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,346
It's much a little thing
for you, Jose,

340
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,307
and it means everything to me.

341
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,144
You're so good
and I like you so much.

342
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,526
I'd really be in terrible trouble
without your help, you know.

343
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,029
Meet me tomorrow at 6:00
and I'll tell you all about it.

344
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,986
Jose:
You're such a liar, Carmen.

345
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,650
Carmen:
No, I'm not.

346
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:11,616
I know you won't believe it,
but I can't get you out of my mind.

347
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,702
Jose: Where have you been
all this time?

348
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,083
Carmen: I'll tell you tomorrow
when we meet,

349
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,585
and then you'll be glad
you helped me.

350
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,122
I love you, Jose.

351
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,014
I didn't ask you
to do it for nothing.

352
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:32,425
Take the money.

353
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,778
And don't pretend that it wasn't
a business arrangement,

354
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,396
'cause I made it clear from the start
that I'd pay you, so there.

355
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,192
Or maybe you think I should fall
at your feet in gratitude.

356
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:46,276
Take the money and forget all about
your damned absurd morality.

357
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,440
Well, why don't you take it?
It won't burn you.

358
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,950
Go on!

359
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,781
Get out! Get out!

360
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,701
Get out!
And don't come back again!

361
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,370
You're just a filthy little slut.

362
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,835
Go back to the gutter
where you belong.

363
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,045
I've had enough of you!

364
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,506
What right have you got
to complain, I'd like to know,

365
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,349
when you're the one
who's running after me?

366
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,552
You're full of principles
till you want something,

367
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,715
and then it's different,

368
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,352
because all your law and order
doesn't mean a thing!

369
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,889
I broke the law, thanks to you.

370
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,729
And if I see you again,
I'll murder you.

371
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,815
You... I'll kill you!
You burn in hell!

372
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:33,008
Carmen:
Jose, don't hate me.

373
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,935
If I didn't love you, I wouldn't
have come here to look for you.

374
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,595
Forgive me, please.

375
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,060
I'm sorry.

376
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,975
Can't you leave me in peace?

377
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,609
You know, it's your fault, Jose.

378
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,616
I wanted to meet you today to explain
that I wouldn't be free tonight,

379
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,277
as I've found some work.

380
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,866
But when you arrived
and your face was so hard,

381
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,282
I believed you wanted me
to pay you in kind.

382
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,667
And it just got me furious.

383
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,349
We'll never be any good
to each other.

384
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,752
It's finished.

385
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,838
No, Jose.

386
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,755
I don't know what's happening
to me, but I love you.

387
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:20,097
I've never loved anyone before,
not even myself.

388
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,476
Why won't you believe me?

389
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,683
The fact that I've found a job
with the countess

390
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,472
will make things so much better.

391
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,734
It means I can finish
with all this poverty.

392
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,271
You're lying.

393
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,190
Shh!

394
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,362
And one day,
when I do begin to tell you lies,

395
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,748
I'm sure you'll believe
it's the truth.

396
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,579
You ought to see the countess.

397
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,870
She's wrinkled and old,
but she still wants all the men around.

398
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,959
Where did you get to know her?

399
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,217
I read the cards for her once
and she was pleased.

400
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,879
Now she wants me to go and see her
to tidy the house and so on

401
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,173
and keep her company
every now and then.

402
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,387
She's so alone.

403
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,270
And where does
your countess live?

404
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,773
It's quite near.

405
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,525
You could come with me.

406
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,652
I thought I'd never find you again.

407
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,064
And then I suddenly thought
of the church.

408
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,607
Well, here we are.

409
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,650
This is where the countess lives.

410
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,821
Look, Jose!
That's one of her lovers.

411
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,786
- Is tomorrow at 6:00 all right?
- Yes. Where?

412
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,792
What do you mean where?
At Dorotea's as usual.

413
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,498
But didn't you say
you had to work?

414
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,459
Oh, of course!
How stupid.

415
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,214
I can't come till 7:00.

416
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,250
See you tomorrow.

417
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,513
Just a second.

418
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,432
So you've started
following me now?

419
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,770
Go away!

420
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,776
I am not playing games
any longer.

421
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,653
You leave me alone, I tell you!

422
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,406
I don't account to anyone
for what I do with my life.

423
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,068
Quiet, both of you.
You'll cause a scandal.

424
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,486
Yeah? Who is in there?

425
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,995
No one, you crazy fool.

426
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,202
You're nothing
but a revolting clown.

427
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,952
You fill me with disgust.

428
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,539
Jose!

429
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,128
He mustn't go in.

430
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,043
Carmen:
No, Jose!

431
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,210
Help me, Lieutenant.

432
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,675
I don't know what this man
wants of me.

433
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,932
Well, this is a surprise,
Private.

434
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,092
Just what do you want?

435
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,259
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I didn't know you were here.

436
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,847
Stand to attention
when I address you, Private.

437
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,027
There's nothing to be afraid of.

438
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,156
Just give him orders
and he'll obey.

439
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:07,195
And now, Private, you can show
the young lady what I've taught you.

440
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,783
About face.

441
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,449
I ordered you to get out of here.

442
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,209
Did you hear me?

443
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,960
Get out.

444
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,999
You insolent scum.

445
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,042
No, Jose!

446
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,515
Dorotea: Do something, can't you?
Make them stop!

447
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,471
Jose, do you want to be shot?

448
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,261
You're crazy.

449
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,300
Carmen:
No!

450
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,807
Let go of me!

451
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,767
Aah!

452
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,885
He's dead.

453
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,890
See what you've done.

454
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,143
He didn't mean a thing
to me, Jose.

455
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,178
Your life is ruined forever.

456
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,313
Completely ruined.

457
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,390
Jose.

458
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:45,305
Jose, it's me.
Get up.

459
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,894
You've got to be strong.

460
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,057
We must go to my friends.

461
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,101
They'll help us.
They'll save you, Jose.

462
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,690
Oh...

463
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,035
Come on.

464
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,741
Jose...

465
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,970
Carmen:
Don't try to move, Jose.

466
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,681
The fever's gone down,
but now you must sleep.

467
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,470
Man:
I've changed the bandage.

468
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,981
Carmen:
We must burn his uniform.

469
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,642
Man: I made a bundle of it
and buried it.

470
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,812
Carmen: No, no.
We must burn it.

471
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,948
Man: If he gets better,
will he stay with us?

472
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,904
Carmen:
Of course.

473
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,740
Give him some more
of that herb tea.

474
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,495
He must sleep.

475
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,523
Hey, you, wait a minute!

476
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,365
Where do you think you're going?

477
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,656
You're too weak to be out here.

478
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,625
How do you expect
to stay on your feet

479
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,377
when you haven't eaten
for more than a week?

480
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,958
Who are you?

481
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,361
You mean you really don't know?

482
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,088
That's a nice way to thank me
for looking after you all this time.

483
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,378
Come on,
let me help you back inside.

484
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,013
- Where are we?
- Zurca.

485
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,924
Beautiful, isn't it?

486
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,309
Take it easy now.

487
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,062
The village was once full of people
like anywhere else.

488
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,972
It's almost uninhabited now.

489
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,641
The young ones all go away.

490
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,229
No life for them here.

491
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,565
The old ones and the babies
survive on goat's milk.

492
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,981
The place isn't so bad,
but there's lot of poverty.

493
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,990
The ground's so arid,
you can't grow a thing.

494
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,153
Here we are. Better lie down
and I'll bring you some milk, huh?

495
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,864
They're good people, though.

496
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,784
The ones that are still here

497
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,170
go out of their way
to do you a favor.

498
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,830
Better now?

499
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,044
Still weak.

500
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,505
I won't give you any more
of that stuff to make you sleep

501
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:02,965
now you're on your feet,

502
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,687
but you've got to do just
what I tell you till the others return.

503
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,220
Here, come on, drink this.

504
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,805
It'll do you good.

505
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:13,764
Where's Carmen?

506
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,432
I don't know,
but she'll be back soon.

507
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,958
She watched over you
day and night.

508
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,376
I'd never have believed it of her.

509
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,613
You know you've got a large price
on your head, Jose.

510
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,681
You know, no one believed
that I could cure you, Jose.

511
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,479
Now you must get to know the others
who helped save you.

512
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,143
But be careful.

513
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:04,189
You mustn't say a single word
to anyone about us two.

514
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,949
So please, swear you won't.

515
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,576
Why not?

516
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:11,079
It's better that way, Jose.

517
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,865
We know that I love you
and you love me.

518
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,581
Still, I'd rather
the others didn't know.

519
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,747
Try to understand
and be on your guard with them.

520
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,275
Dancairo and Juan will be
staying with you for a few days.

521
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,676
Then we're all moving out.

522
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,685
Well, made up your mind
about Gibraltar?

523
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,221
Maybe he could go there.

524
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,640
I can't.
They know my face too well.

525
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,534
Carmen: It doesn't matter
so much who goes there.

526
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,401
We can talk about that
when the time comes.

527
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,734
The main thing is to be quite sure
you can handle everything else.

528
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,537
Meantime, Dancairo,
why don't you tell him

529
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,792
what you found out in Seville?

530
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,784
They're convinced
that you've fled to the north

531
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,504
and that's where they're looking
for you now.

532
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,577
They called off the search
in and around the city several days ago.

533
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,210
So you're free to wander about as openly
as you like if you've got the guts.

534
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,369
That's enough.

535
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,216
Obviously, you can never
go back to Seville

536
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,557
or any place where you're known.

537
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,131
You'll have to be on your guard
in case there's trouble.

538
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,672
Though I doubt if even his friends
would recognize him now.

539
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,483
Anyway, if you want to stay
and work with us,

540
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,009
we're ready to take you on.

541
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,681
It depends on the kind of work.

542
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,967
Now that you're not getting
the three good meals a day

543
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,436
from the king, you'll have
to make a living somehow.

544
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,320
Listen, I have to go now, Jose.

545
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,153
Come with me
and I'll tell you all about it.

546
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,043
Jose: I ran away from my village
when I was still a boy,

547
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:33,304
and I've always been reserved
and impulsive ever since.

548
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,464
I wanted to make
something of myself,

549
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,224
and I failed from the start.

550
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:40,478
I was waiting for a promotion
before I went to visit my family.

551
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,638
And now I will never
see them again.

552
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,433
You were right that night,
Carmen, my life is ruined.

553
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,479
That's not true, Jose.
We'll get by if we stay together.

554
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,567
Living like outlaws, I suppose.

555
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,824
Cheating the state
and robbing your neighbors.

556
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,529
It's not for me.

557
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,320
It's not my idea of life either
and nor is it theirs.

558
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,113
None of us wanted
to live this way,

559
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,328
but sometimes you find
you have no choice,

560
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,788
because respectable people
have no pity.

561
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,679
And if you make a mistake,
one little mistake...

562
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,080
Forget it, Carmen.

563
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,126
All right, but you just try
going to a fine lady

564
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,005
and saying, "I murdered
an officer by accident,

565
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,978
but please give me a job
and don't tell the police."

566
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,551
You try it, and then tell me
if you don't feel like stealing

567
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,556
from your so-called neighbor.

568
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,443
Being born a gypsy
is considered enough

569
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:31,229
to make me a criminal
right from the start.

570
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,647
When I was only four years old,

571
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,441
I was already being sent
to beg on the streets.

572
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,531
Yes, I am
what I always had to be.

573
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,866
But all the same, I love you.

574
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,708
Well, then,
let's go away together

575
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,376
and begin all over again,
Carmen.

576
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,044
A new life, a clean one.

577
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,634
- Where could we go?
- To the new world... America.

578
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:01,097
We can find someone to give us
a passage and hide us.

579
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,353
But no, it's impossible.

580
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,229
We haven't the money.

581
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,733
Oh, but you're wrong.
It doesn't have to be impossible.

582
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,441
I'm tired, too.
I'd be so glad to get away.

583
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,731
The money is necessary,
but we can get it.

584
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,945
In Gibraltar
there's an English diplomat

585
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,002
who's going to transfer
an enormous quantity of gold

586
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,573
to Granada in a few days' time.

587
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,238
Enough to solve all our problems.

588
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,124
He's so rich, it's just not true.

589
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,581
So it wouldn't harm anybody
very much, Jose.

590
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,707
You brought me here
to make me talk of that?

591
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:36,298
I want to stay with you
and I'm prepared to find the means.

592
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,196
Jose! Jose!

593
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,299
Thank goodness.

594
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,066
I was afraid
that you wouldn't come back.

595
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,403
If you had robbed me
of my horse,

596
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,238
I swear I'd have hunted you
to the ends of the earth.

597
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,531
Why, I might even
have murdered you.

598
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,398
So that's how you trust me.

599
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,935
If you promise not to laugh,
I'll tell you something, Jose.

600
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,774
Why should I want to laugh?

601
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,109
I had a brother once,

602
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,900
but when he was only
five years old, he died.

603
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,569
He was a funny little kid.

604
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:43,975
I don't know if he was backward

605
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,705
or whether he was suffering
from some illness or other.

606
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,707
Anyway, he never spoke
a single word.

607
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,584
He could hear as well
as anyone else,

608
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,121
but he would only communicate
with his hands and his eyes.

609
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,587
Oh, I loved him, and I took him
with me just about everywhere.

610
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,298
But when I began to work
along with the smugglers,

611
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,758
I had to leave the kid
at home, of course.

612
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,923
And he wasn't there
when I went back.

613
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,092
He'd died while I was away.

614
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,679
And that's the reason
why I haven't been home since.

615
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,189
But what I wanted
to tell you was this.

616
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:14,646
As we were passing
through Badaucin one day,

617
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,732
I saw him there in a field.

618
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,488
This horse, I mean.
He was all alone.

619
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,321
And I don't know why,
but it made me think of my brother.

620
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,156
I stole him
just because of that.

621
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,787
And I think he's my brother
here on earth again.

622
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,619
He's been so gentle
and obedient with me.

623
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,705
I know he's the kid
returned to keep me company.

624
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:33,869
It's a beautiful story.

625
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,960
Now I know why he means
so much to you.

626
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,297
Jose, have you decided
to stay with us?

627
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,302
Carmen made it all clear.

628
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,839
And I'll stay if they accept
my conditions.

629
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,267
Jose: During the next few days,
we must watch the road carefully

630
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,151
and check how long it takes
for a carriage

631
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,108
to get here from the crossroads,
going at a normal pace.

632
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,649
We'll post someone up there
to give us the signal.

633
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,659
Juan can begin digging the hole
up on the cliff right now.

634
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,617
And don't forget it has to be
at least five feet deep.

635
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,419
And once I get up there
and start digging,

636
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,371
how long am I supposed to stay?

637
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,331
A month if necessary.

638
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,621
Then why don't you do it?
It'd suit you much better.

639
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,789
Give you enough wine,
you'd be happy in hell.

640
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,916
- What do you mean by that?
- Forget it, Dancairo.

641
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,835
Now, as I said,
we need two men at least,

642
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,096
but three would be better.

643
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,007
The third man would only be used
in case of necessity, of course.

644
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:30,017
No, no, we've always shared
everything equally.

645
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,849
The more of us there are,
the less we get.

646
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,091
Better keep it down to two.

647
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,058
Juan's an idiot,
but he's the best shot in Spain.

648
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,691
I said no shooting,
and I mean it.

649
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,202
Very well.
There'll be no shooting.

650
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,069
It's your plan.

651
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,697
That way, the Englishman
will only realize his gold

652
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,483
has been stolen
when he reaches Granada.

653
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,743
If anyone is wounded,
let alone killed,

654
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,582
we'll have all the police
in Spain after us

655
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,535
- in a matter of hours.
- You're right.

656
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,132
Look, you know
that in case of emergency,

657
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,669
Carmen'll pass us a message.

658
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,249
Or better still, ask Roxana.

659
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,130
She knows where we are.

660
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,891
What do you want?

661
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,992
I want to buy a bridle
for my horse.

662
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,619
I see.
And who told you to come here?

663
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,493
My friend, Dancairo.

664
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,128
Well, you'd better take
some skins

665
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,631
and go to number seven,
Avenue de la Serna.

666
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,462
Ask to see Carmen.

667
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,811
Tell her you're a peddler
and that you come from Guadix.

668
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,633
I understand.

669
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,344
Remember, if he comes in,
we don't know each other.

670
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,053
And don't forget
he speaks Spanish.

671
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,308
Wait here.

672
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,889
Well, now, how much
do I owe you?

673
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,429
You said 30 didn't you?

674
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,678
Here you are.

675
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,934
The skins aren't worth
half what you asked for them,

676
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,346
but the master's
in a generous mood today.

677
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,561
I can't tell you, these people
are enough to drive you mad.

678
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,397
It's only because
we must have that gold

679
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,186
that I can face them at all.

680
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,697
Here, take this.

681
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,654
I've written everything there.

682
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,245
- When do you expect to leave?
- Tuesday afternoon.

683
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,997
And I said that road was the best
because it's much quicker.

684
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,204
So do please tell Dancairo

685
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,461
that everything must go
perfectly smoothly.

686
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,138
Otherwise, they'll say
it's all my fault.

687
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,334
You leave it to me.

688
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,716
I'd like to kiss you so much.

689
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,592
Isn't this place magnificent?

690
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,438
- There he is. That's him.
- So what do you expect us to do?

691
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,554
Spring to attention?

692
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,762
If you're wise,
you won't provoke the lad.

693
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,972
Leave him alone.

694
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,311
Careful now.

695
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,689
You could blow up
half the mountain with that.

696
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,145
Who are those two?

697
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,309
One's a man from my village,
name of Miguel.

698
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,025
The other one's Garcia,
Carmen's husband.

699
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,322
- Carmen's what?
- Husband. He was in prison.

700
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,504
She's been trying to get him out
for the last two years,

701
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,451
and now she's done it.

702
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,410
You be careful, Jose.

703
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,954
He means a whole lot of trouble.

704
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,747
Careful of what?

705
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,220
Well, Jose...

706
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,553
you can tell us all about it.

707
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,722
These are our new companions,
Miguel and Garcia.

708
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,106
Our law-abiding leader,

709
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,893
but nobody wants a sermon
from you, Preacher.

710
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,651
The carriage'll pass on Tuesday

711
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,293
with Carmen
and the Englishman inside.

712
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,528
There'll be one escort.

713
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,819
The chest of gold
will be under the floor.

714
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,579
I've already got
all the dynamite we need.

715
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:45,161
Who wants dynamite?

716
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,201
Afraid of blood, soldier boy?

717
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,380
No, I'm not afraid.

718
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,892
There won't be
any shooting, though.

719
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,044
I became the commander
just to avoid bloodshed.

720
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,214
And if you don't like it,
you're free to go away.

721
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,428
I wouldn't shout so much
if I were in your shoes.

722
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,144
Listen to me, all of you.

723
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,526
Remendado will keep watch
and give us the signal.

724
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,439
Juan will be on top of the cliff,
ready to light the fuse,

725
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:21,156
and I will be down in the road
to meet the carriage.

726
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:25,414
You two must be waiting for us
at the turn-off, as we agreed before.

727
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:28,621
Remember that everything
has to be done as quickly as possible.

728
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,708
Is something wrong, Carmen?

729
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,719
No, of course not.

730
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:24,132
Why should there be?
I'm so happy being with you.

731
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,596
Don't be afraid, dearest.

732
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,681
You're going to stay
with me forever.

733
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,459
Stop! Stop!

734
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,087
The road's blocked.
You can't get through.

735
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,919
Come here, will you?
What's happened?

736
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,379
What are you talking about?

737
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,589
A landslide.
There's been a landslide.

738
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:45,379
The road's full of rocks.

739
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:49,220
Sir, for years I've been using this road
and it's always been safe and quiet.

740
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,681
If I were you,
I'd turn back and at once, sir.

741
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,641
This landslide could be
part of an ambush.

742
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,852
But that's impossible.

743
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,438
- Is much of the road covered?
- Come and look.

744
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,854
It's quite impossible
to get through, sir.

745
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,397
You stay here.

746
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,816
You come with me,
if you don't mind.

747
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,043
It'll take a long time to clear a path
through all that, I'm afraid.

748
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,042
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'll pay you well.

749
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,454
Come on, let's have a look.

750
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,425
For heaven's sake, hurry.

751
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,598
Hah! Hyah!

752
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,304
Look, sir, the carriage!

753
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,265
Stop! Stop, I say!

754
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,429
Hah!

755
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,688
Hah! Hyah! Hyah!

756
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:44,192
Hyah!

757
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,949
HYah! Hyah!

758
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:10,798
Hah!

759
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,309
HYah! Hyah!

760
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,482
Hyah!

761
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,659
Hah! Hah!

762
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,258
Whoa!

763
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,809
Come on, quickly.

764
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,542
Quick, Miguel.

765
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,425
Hah! Hah!

766
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,491
Hah!

767
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,873
- Englishman: What happened?
- Jose: He stole two horses.

768
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,490
Quickly.
The lady's not well.

769
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,401
- Are you all right, my dear?
- I was so frightened.

770
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:38,536
- It was awful. I feel so bad.
- I know, my dear.

771
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,663
You've had a nasty shock,
but it's all over now.

772
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:41,823
Was he alone?

773
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,913
Yes, I'm sure there was
no one else there.

774
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,419
As soon as I arrived,
they took their horses and fled.

775
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,047
I couldn't follow him because
I had to hold back the carriage,

776
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,753
but I'm sure I wounded him.

777
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,169
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
- Guard: Excellency.

778
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,384
All this looks fishy to me.
I want to take a look around.

779
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,765
All right, but be careful.

780
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,473
But you're mad. Come back.
It's dangerous.

781
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,778
He'll bring your horse back,
don't worry.

782
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:03,988
Carmen:
I don't want to stay here.

783
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,514
I'm so frightened.
Take me away.

784
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,808
Please, please, take me away.

785
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,317
The young lady's right.

786
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,649
And in my opinion,
you'd be wise to turn back, sir.

787
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,234
You'd be foolish to face
such a journey with only two horses

788
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,649
and the young lady so unwell.

789
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,392
Sefior!

790
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,695
The game's gone on long enough.

791
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,198
Put your hands up
and drop that pistol.

792
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:00,361
But you'll ruin it all.
Go away! You're crazy!

793
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,700
That'll do, Preacher.

794
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,742
You're worse than the police,
you filthy coward.

795
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:08,952
No!

796
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,085
Look out, over there!

797
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,669
We've got to get him.

798
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,051
That fool Juan
should have killed him.

799
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,836
He mustn't get away.

800
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,307
It's over for us.

801
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,642
We've come to the beginning
of the end.

802
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,391
Remendado,
thank God I found you.

803
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:37,559
We can't leave you here.

804
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,773
Go away, Jose.
Go away.

805
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,031
No, you know I couldn't.
You've got to try...

806
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,614
It's not worth the effort, Jose.
I'm... I'm going to die.

807
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,078
The explosion must have frightened
the horse and he ran away.

808
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,540
I tried to get him back,
but that soldier saw me on...

809
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,704
On the hill and fired.

810
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,373
Jose, you take the horse.

811
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,166
I want him to be with you.

812
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,549
Don't speak now.

813
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,086
You've got to save your strength.

814
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,550
- We must try and reach the others.
- No, no, go away.

815
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,715
Save yourself, at least.
Please, Jose.

816
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,224
Leave me... ah!
Leave me here, Jose.

817
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:47,303
Jose: Stop! Stop, Garcia!
Come here.

818
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:48,463
Give me a hand, quickly.

819
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,507
Dismount and help me
put the boy on the horse.

820
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,017
He's dying, Garcia.
He's dying, I tell you.

821
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:54,376
We mustn't waste time on that.

822
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,096
That damn guard
managed to get away,

823
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,182
and by now all the police
in town'll be after us.

824
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,743
We must get 'em
off our tracks somehow.

825
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,567
Abandon the horses
and take to the mountains.

826
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,146
All right, then.
We must carry him ourselves, Garcia.

827
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:06,030
We can't let him die like this.

828
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,691
You're right.

829
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,249
You murderer!

830
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:35,010
- Murderer!
- You're yellow, Preacher.

831
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,734
You swine.

832
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:56,281
- I could kill you if I wanted to.
- No. No. No.

833
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,541
Preacher, that's enough.

834
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,577
We've got to get away.
What's done is done.

835
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,212
We must get the gold
and try to save our own skins now.

836
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:06,500
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?

837
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,294
You didn't want him
to suffer, did you?

838
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,461
Let go of me.

839
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,928
You're nothing
but a filthy criminal.

840
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,842
Well, that's just too bad, isn't it?

841
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:20,059
'Cause in future, I'm the one
that's giving the orders, Preacher.

842
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,895
But a filthy criminal!

843
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,865
We're all just about done for.

844
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,282
Why don't we stop for a moment,
if only to decide what to do next?

845
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,746
We'll make our plans
when we're safe up there.

846
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,602
I'll take that.

847
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:37,301
There's a village
way down in the valley.

848
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,259
It's pretty obvious that Carmen's
the only one we can risk sending.

849
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,483
So she'll just have to go
and get us everything we need...

850
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,976
Clothing, some food and water,
and information.

851
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,196
She must find out which areas
they're searching for us

852
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,864
and make sure they're kept
well off our track.

853
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:52,483
That miserable guard
will have reported the three of us,

854
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,486
but Carmen's
the innocent victim, that's all.

855
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:56,885
Why, she could report him, too,

856
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,027
for having abandoned her
to the mercy of thieves.

857
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:01,033
Kiss me.

858
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,496
Off you go.

859
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,702
Best foot forward.

860
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,967
Make a statement to the police
about those wicked robbers

861
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,751
and send them all off
in the wrong direction.

862
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,205
Go on, and come back
as soon as you can.

863
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:16,625
Go with her as far as the road at least
since you know the area.

864
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:20,178
No, and I'll tell you why not.

865
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:24,716
I don't trust you two.

866
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,552
Let's send Jose.

867
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,598
I don't want anyone.
I can go by myself.

868
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:33,766
I'll come back in two days
if not before.

869
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:36,106
Don't worry.

870
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,830
Carmen, wait for me.

871
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:49,457
I'll go with you.

872
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,743
Let's get away from here
and escape on our own.

873
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:52,910
Are you mad?

874
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:54,624
That's just what they're hoping for.

875
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,084
You stay and keep an eye
on them.

876
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:59,376
And remember that money
is our only hope of salvation.

877
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,340
I'll be back soon, Jose.

878
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,666
Wait till we have to tell Enriques
we'll pay him in sovereigns.

879
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:35,704
The idea of living in America
isn't so bad.

880
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,248
Now we've the money to get there.

881
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,635
It's only that...
there are too many of us.

882
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,589
Hey, Preacher, bring that here.

883
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,426
You can come and get it.

884
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:56,437
Dancairo, tell the preacher
to obey orders,

885
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:59,773
or I'll make him regret
the day he was born.

886
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,609
We don't want his kind with us.

887
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,431
Listen, Preacher.

888
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:46,320
I've got nothing personal
against you.

889
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,486
It's the idea of having to share
one ounce of that gold with you

890
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,529
that turns my stomach.

891
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:56,409
On your feet.

892
01:14:57,868 --> 01:15:00,963
Did you hear, Preacher?

893
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:07,970
That's better, Preacher.

894
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,632
That's it. That's it.

895
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:12,345
Come on.

896
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,012
Come on if you've got the guts.

897
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,805
Come on, Preacher.

898
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,692
That's it.

899
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,701
Know a bayonet, don't you?

900
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,862
Come on.
That's it. That's it.

901
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,958
Now let's see what they taught you
in the army, eh?

902
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,640
Preacher.

903
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,647
Come on.
Get up, you coward.

904
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,319
Come on.

905
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,153
Come on.
Come on.

906
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,211
You didn't expect that,
did you, Preacher?

907
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,223
- I can't see anymore.
- Here I am.

908
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,858
I don't want to kill you
right now.

909
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,314
I want to have
some more fun with you.

910
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:33,908
Preacher... stinking,
moralizing, filthy preacher.

911
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,828
Get up, you coward.
Get on your feet.

912
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,942
Preacher.

913
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,683
Preacher...

914
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,235
You won't get far on your own,

915
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:26,617
so I wouldn't even try to start
if I were you.

916
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:32,364
What's wrong with you?

917
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,092
You mean you thought
I was hiding the money

918
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,459
to keep it for myself?

919
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:36,834
That's what you mean, eh?

920
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,371
Or do you want to keep it all?

921
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,631
Don't move or I swear you'll get

922
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,587
the same treatment
that you gave Garcia.

923
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,269
I was going to be
the next one, wasn't I?

924
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,716
But you made a mistake,
because I'll murder you first.

925
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:48,927
I don't want to murder anyone.

926
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,467
But it's madness for us
to wait up here forever.

927
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:54,102
If anything delays Carmen,
then what do we do?

928
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,638
You haven't thought of that.

929
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:59,104
Perhaps we'll die of hunger
or go raving mad with thirst.

930
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,946
Better bury the gold for the present
and go find the things we need.

931
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,314
And if you don't want to come with me,
then I'll go on my own.

932
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,108
You're right.

933
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:10,949
We must get away from here
before I go out of my mind.

934
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,658
Look at me.

935
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,698
My hands are trembling.

936
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:18,244
I'm always the same way
when I can't get anything to drink.

937
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,209
Leave me alone.
Go away from me.

938
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:22,998
Go away!

939
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:32,091
Dancairo.

940
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,056
It's one of my attacks.
Keep away from me.

941
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,846
- Leave me alone.
- Dancairo.

942
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,521
Ca“ W" 90 away?
Away!

943
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,821
Go away.
Leave me alone.

944
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:16,852
Dancairo: They're not peasants.
Wait till they get closer.

945
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:19,639
Jose:
Just our luck.

946
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,354
They won't have a thing to eat
with them.

947
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:23,893
The mules'll be useful, anyway.

948
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,936
I'll go down.
You wait up here.

949
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:27,650
Jose:
I'm coming, too.

950
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,789
Dancairo:
Stop. Put your hands up.

951
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,869
Carmen.

952
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:44,834
How lovely. For a moment
you thought I was a real lady.

953
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,670
Come on, I haven't much time.

954
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:49,432
I brought you some food and clothes,
and I'll leave you that mule.

955
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:51,466
You'll need it
to take everything to Gaucin.

956
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,006
To Sancho's place.
You know where he lives.

957
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,173
Why Gaucin?

958
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,139
Oh, of course
you must let me explain.

959
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:01,146
After I'd been walking for an hour,
a big coach came along,

960
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,979
full of people all going
to Gaucin for the corrida.

961
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:05,609
And guess who was with them.

962
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:09,021
Lucas, my old friend,
the greatest bullfighter in Andalusia.

963
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,440
Lucas lent me money
to buy everything.

964
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,280
I only have to ask.

965
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,911
The money we have
is more than enough for us.

966
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:17,912
To my mind Jose's right.

967
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:20,290
Now we must only think
of how to get away and quickly

968
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:22,329
if we don't want the police
to catch up with us.

969
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,368
And you, too.

970
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,537
I know.
Now listen to me.

971
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,798
Lucas' best friend
will be sailing from Malaga

972
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,176
for South America next week
and he's promised we can travel

973
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,588
on board the ship
as members of his special party.

974
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,552
He can help us
get into the country, too.

975
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:40,265
All we have to do now is pay someone
to take us out to the boat in secret.

976
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:44,273
Well, Jose... the New World,
just as you wanted.

977
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,193
Yes, I know.

978
01:25:48,352 --> 01:25:49,899
Ask me where your husband is.

979
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,063
Why should I?

980
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,982
He's up there in the mountains
with the money.

981
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,651
I murdered him.

982
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:05,627
Then you realize
our time has now come.

983
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:19,557
You must see I'm right.

984
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,094
Don't you realize there are
hundreds of police out after us?

985
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,513
We can't possibly reach Gaucin
with all this stuff.

986
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,681
It's much too dangerous.

987
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,566
Carmen's there waiting for us,
so we must take the risk.

988
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,352
It's a trick to rob us of everything.

989
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,520
Listen to me.

990
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,860
You shouldn't trust Carmen.
I know her too well.

991
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,490
We've got to go where I say.

992
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,947
It's after Gaucin,
not so far from the sea.

993
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:41,284
We'll be much safer hiding there
till the ship leaves.

994
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,198
All right.

995
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,083
Carmen's coming, too, though.

996
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,165
I'm going to fetch her.

997
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:48,954
You've been good to me, Jose.

998
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,873
I won't forget that.

999
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,865
Jose!

1000
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,164
Why are you so late?
Is something wrong?

1001
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:27,872
Dancairo won't stay in Gaucin.

1002
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:32,210
I only wanted to tell you that we'll be
in the tavern at the crossroads.

1003
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,374
You left Dancairo alone?

1004
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,339
Oh, you must be a fool!

1005
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,146
You mean you couldn't see
it was only a trick

1006
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:40,093
to rob us
of our share of the gold?

1007
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,883
So everything we had
is completely lost.

1008
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:45,936
Don't worry.

1009
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:49,314
He's a good man.
I promise you.

1010
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,101
And besides, he's too sick
to run away, so come with me.

1011
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,486
I'm not going anywhere with you!

1012
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:55,861
You think I'm crazy?

1013
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:58,820
You're not just a thief and a killer,
but a complete idiot!

1014
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,609
Leave me alone and go to hell!

1015
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:01,902
Come here!

1016
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:10,119
I could murder you
for what you said.

1017
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,547
You make me laugh.

1018
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,129
Really, you do.

1019
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,919
You make me sick.

1020
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,454
You're stupid, Jose.

1021
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:55,668
Why do you get upset?

1022
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:58,584
You know I have to stay
to work on Lucas.

1023
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:01,803
There's no reason forjealousy.

1024
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:03,805
We want to get
onto that ship, don't we?

1025
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:06,808
And he's the only one
who can help us.

1026
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:10,391
I love you, Jose.

1027
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,056
Or I wouldn't have
worked so hard

1028
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:14,645
to help us get away
and begin all over again.

1029
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:17,152
Now everything's ready,
you know that?

1030
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:26,911
You don't know me yet,

1031
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:29,823
so be careful.

1032
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:33,915
Everything's prepared for the day
after tomorrow at San Nicola.

1033
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:36,421
No wonder that I'm nervous.

1034
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:37,877
This is what you have to do.

1035
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,633
Ask at the crossroads
for a fisherman called Pedro.

1036
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,752
He'll take you to the beach
where I'll be waiting.

1037
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:44,964
The ship sails at sunset.

1038
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:47,224
Oh, look what you've done
to your hand!

1039
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,601
How silly you are, Jose.

1040
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,558
I'll put this handkerchief on it.

1041
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,653
Pedro: I tell you,
if we wait any longer,

1042
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,567
we'll never make it.

1043
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:10,035
The ship's already well out to sea
and she'll be off the big headland

1044
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:11,914
within a few more minutes.

1045
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,667
Dancairo: Don't worry.
We're just coming.

1046
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,328
Pedro:
Then hurry up.

1047
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,292
Don't you realize
there'll be trouble for us

1048
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,173
if we're caught here with you?

1049
01:30:21,374 --> 01:30:23,843
Carmen won't come
and you might have known it.

1050
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:26,096
Even the fisherman
only expected the two of us.

1051
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,131
Try to face the facts, Jose.

1052
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:30,471
Why deceive yourself any longer?

1053
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:34,104
Why ruin your life for the sake
of a dirty prostitute?

1054
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,014
It's a form of madness.

1055
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,809
You're coming with me
if I have to drag you away by force!

1056
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,608
You keep away from me now.

1057
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,398
Board the damn boat alone.

1058
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:46,542
You've dreamed of that money
all your life, haven't you?

1059
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:48,409
Well, take it.
It's yours.

1060
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:49,865
Go away.

1061
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,705
You know that Carmen's
now living with Lucas.

1062
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,589
Even the fisherman'll tell you.

1063
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:04,592
This is our last chance.
We're finished if we stay here.

1064
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:07,129
I won't give up my hopes
of a decent life now.

1065
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:08,421
We're rich, Jose.

1066
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:11,683
We can start all over again
and learn to be respectable.

1067
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,718
Quickly!
We gotta go.

1068
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,683
If you're coming, come on.

1069
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:23,149
You'd better let me follow
my own road

1070
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:25,905
or I'll damn you
to the end of the world.

1071
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:25,858
Thank you, Lucas.

1072
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:30,359
Bravo, Lucas!
Bravo!

1073
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:36,532
B ravo!

1074
01:33:57,674 --> 01:33:59,676
B ravo!

1075
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:03,138
Marvelous!

1076
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:07,896
B ravo!

1077
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,608
What do you think you're doing?

1078
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,613
Leave me alone!
Let go!

1079
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:15,571
- You're coming with me.
- Lucas!

1080
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:17,235
Lucas!

1081
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:36,721
How many times must I tell you
it's not safe for us here?

1082
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,357
I thought you were already
on the boat,

1083
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:39,941
so I told the police
you'd come this way

1084
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:41,596
just so they'd leave me alone.

1085
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,267
Tell me why you deceived me.

1086
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:47,353
I never meant
to go away with you.

1087
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,313
I want to be free
and I always will.

1088
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,069
You may lead me to my death,
but I won't live with you!

1089
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:57,363
You stayed because of Lucas.

1090
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:58,565
You're in love with Lucas.

1091
01:34:58,693 --> 01:34:59,785
You poor fool.

1092
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:02,914
I loved Lucas for a day or two,
no more than I did all the other men.

1093
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:05,700
But now I'm in love with nobody,
nobody at all.

1094
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:10,038
You knew you weren't coming,

1095
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:11,765
so why didn't you say so
from the start?

1096
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:13,959
Because I'm tired of you,
because I was afraid of you,

1097
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,344
because I wanted you
to leave me in peace!

1098
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:18,175
If you want to kill me
for this, go on.

1099
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,011
It's fate,
but it won't change me.

1100
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,272
I don't want to kill you.

1101
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:29,228
We can forget the past
and begin again.

1102
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,142
I don't need to forget
about anything!

1103
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:33,152
It's not my fault
you became what you are.

1104
01:35:36,022 --> 01:35:37,899
Leave me alone!

1105
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:41,036
Go away!
Go away!

1106
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,696
I don't want you!

1107
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,423
You loved me once, didn't you?

1108
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,838
Tell me you loved me once.

1109
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:43,473
That you didn't lie
at the beginning.

1110
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:45,599
Tell me before it's too late.

1111
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:48,432
That you believed for one moment
that we could save each other.

1112
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:50,471
What can I do
to make you understand?

1113
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:54,017
Your New World never meant
anything to me.

1114
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,356
I've never been in love
with you, Jose.

1115
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:58,066
And now I'm sick of you!

1116
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:59,822
I'm sick of you, do you hear?

1117
01:36:59,981 --> 01:37:01,198
And I hate you!

1118
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:03,610
I mean it, I hate you!

1119
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,744
No! No!

1120
01:38:01,626 --> 01:38:03,674
Carmen.

1121
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:06,055
Carmen.

1122
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,261
Carmen.
