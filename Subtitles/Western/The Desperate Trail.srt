1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:59,648


2
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,924
What did you say that thing is?

3
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:02,088


4
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:05,763
It's a farming implement
of the latest scientific design.

5
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:05,888


6
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,402
It's a present for a friend of mine.

7
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:13,208


8
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,846
Is that your kids?

9
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:15,168


10
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,488
Excuse me.

11
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,248


12
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,478
It's my brother and I as boys.

13
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:21,848


14
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,521
Afraid I'm just an old maid.

15
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:23,608


16
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:25,724
You need a family, boy.

17
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:25,888


18
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:28,198
Sea, it says in the Good Book...

19
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:28,528


20
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,327
"Take you a wife."
That's what he told Adam.

21
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:31,728


22
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:34,117
"Take a rib and make you a wife."

23
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:34,368


24
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:37,360
Mamie here is my helpmate and my faith.

25
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,488


26
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:43,085
Of course, a man's got to be
king in his family, only way.

27
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:44,248


28
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:45,682
So it seems.

29
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:46,328


30
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:48,126
Excuse me, ma'am, I was wondering--

31
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:48,208


32
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,006
I don't know nothing about farming.

33
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:50,088


34
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:51,840
More money in horses.

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:51,928


36
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:55,444
Did you break any horses back there
in New York, Cooper?

37
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,248


38
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,205
No, can't say as I have.

39
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:13,848


40
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:16,044
Make sure you stop them horses.

41
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:17,008


42
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,205
- Fergus, get them folks off the stage.
- Kill them?

43
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:24,688


44
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:26,964
Not unless they ask you nicely.

45
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:31,408


46
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:33,319
Excuse me, ma'am, I was wondering--

47
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,408


48
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:36,127
Busted me a horse last year,
must've been 1,200 pounds.

49
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:36,208


50
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,279
Gotta show them who's boss.

51
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,608


52
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:40,246
Same as with women.

53
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:45,648


54
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,922
It's Latin.

55
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:47,248


56
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:50,240
"Manly excellence flourishes in trial."

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,728


58
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,207
Excuse me. I was wondering...

59
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:57,288


60
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,484
Would you happen to be stopping
in Three Forks?

61
00:04:59,484 --> 00:04:59,568


62
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,286
- Why?
- Well...

63
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:02,008


64
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:05,000
If you don't have any prior
engagements, with all due respect...

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,088


66
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:08,285
I was wondering if you'd
like to have dinner with me?

67
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:08,848


68
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,600
Go chase yourself.

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,928


70
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,442
Afraid Miss O'Rourke can't make it.

71
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,328


72
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,727
Needs her beauty rest.

73
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:19,808


74
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,640
Got an appointment bright and early.

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:21,728


76
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,127
I'll be damned.

77
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:39,848


78
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,122
I love it.

79
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,728


80
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:44,957
Let's go.

81
00:05:44,957 --> 00:07:00,288


82
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,323
Stop!

83
00:07:01,323 --> 00:07:02,168


84
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:03,681
Get them people out of there!

85
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:03,768


86
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:05,805
All right, everybody out of there.

87
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:13,448


88
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,483
Easy.

89
00:07:14,483 --> 00:08:51,728


90
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:53,127
Who's a hero? You?

91
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:53,208


92
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,484
- How about you?
- Not me, ma'am.

93
00:08:55,484 --> 00:09:27,728


94
00:09:27,728 --> 00:09:29,162
Everybody all right?

95
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:29,688


96
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:32,726
Fine. Very fine.

97
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:33,528


98
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:36,088
Act stupid, and your face will
have a new hole.

99
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:36,168


100
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,761
Undo your gun belt.

101
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:43,648


102
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:45,321
Undo these bracelets.

103
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:48,968


104
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,402
Now move back.

105
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:53,648


106
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:55,400
All of you, get out.

107
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,368


108
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,483
Move!

109
00:09:57,483 --> 00:10:00,568


110
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,082
- There's no need to insult me by--
- Move it!

111
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:03,808


112
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,958
You made me drop my box.

113
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,768


114
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,918
Now lock yourself to the stage.

115
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:11,008


116
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,601
See how it feels.

117
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,448


118
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,564
You, get that strongbox down.

119
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:23,168


120
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,806
Let's see what we got here.

121
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:28,768


122
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:30,839
You gonna add thieving to killing, girl?

123
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:30,928


124
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:34,159
If it gets me out of here.
What are you gonna do, hang me twice?

125
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:34,248


126
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:36,922
Hey, fancy pants,
get one of those saddlebags.

127
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:37,008


128
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,681
- Who? Me?
- Move it!

129
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,768


130
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:44,602
Bring it over here, put this scratch in it.
And don't get no sticky fingers.

131
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:44,688


132
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:47,441
No. Needn't worry about me.

133
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:51,808


134
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:53,845
How'd you get that shiner, ma'am?

135
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:54,208


136
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,597
- She fell.
- Anybody talking to you?

137
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:58,528


138
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,087
I didn't think so.

139
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:01,088


140
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:02,726
How'd you get it?

141
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:05,608


142
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:06,928
I fell down.

143
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:12,448


144
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:14,359
Looks like he fell down, too.

145
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:14,448


146
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:15,677
MY Bye.

147
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:20,288


148
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,881
Here's your scratch.

149
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:21,968


150
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,118
Ma'am, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

151
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:24,208


152
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:28,122
You see, I don't understand how you can
make a success of robbing when...

153
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,088


154
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,886
You can't hold on to the damn gun.

155
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:30,968


156
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:32,117
Good work, son.

157
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:32,208


158
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,563
- Shoot the bitch!
- Get over there.

159
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,088


160
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:36,123
Go on.

161
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,048


162
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:38,561
Go on. You too, miss.

163
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:39,408


164
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,127
Now, miss, if you'd do me a favor
and lock the Marshall...

165
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:42,208


166
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,644
And Mr. Hollister there around
the window, I'd appreciate that.

167
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:48,128


168
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,927
Well, I certainly didn't plan it like this...

169
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:51,568


170
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:54,481
But as my old Latin teacher used to say,
carpe <i>diam.</i>

171
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,648


172
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,208
So, what's her appointment for anyway?

173
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:58,888


174
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,607
I'm taking this whore
to hang for killing a man.

175
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:06,088


176
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:07,408
A little advice.

177
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:08,928


178
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,487
When you're handcuffed...

179
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:10,568


180
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:12,639
Refrain from insulting comments.

181
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,448


182
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:14,677
By the way, Mr. Hollister...

183
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:14,768


184
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,920
- How did your wife get that black eye?
- How the hell do you think?

185
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,008


186
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:19,442
I smacked her.

187
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:23,608


188
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:24,678
Jesus!

189
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:26,368


190
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:30,077
The Bible says love and protect
your family, not beat them.

191
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:34,768


192
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,918
I think I'm gonna be on my way.

193
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:37,608


194
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:40,487
You can keep that appointment
if you want to.

195
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:41,008


196
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:43,921
You son of a bitch! That money's mine!

197
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:44,968


198
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,005
Not as long as I got the gun, it ain't.

199
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:47,088


200
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,920
You all take care now.

201
00:12:48,920 --> 00:13:15,448


202
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:17,519
I'll have a bed and a bottle.

203
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,048


204
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,039
I'll have the bottle now.

205
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,248


206
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:23,206
- I'll have a woman, too.
- Take your pick.

207
00:13:23,206 --> 00:13:27,648


208
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,639
Right there. The one with the dark hair.

209
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:29,728


210
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:32,925
- Go chase yourself.
- Jane.

211
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:35,408


212
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,968
Kind of reminds me of someone I know.

213
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:38,128


214
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,323
Don't we all?

215
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:40,088


216
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:41,726
Janie, number 3.

217
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:46,328


218
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,046
What's in the box?

219
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:48,488


220
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:50,638
Something that stays with me.

221
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:51,128


222
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,802
Your property's safe as sin
in there, mister.

223
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:54,128


224
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,277
Yeah?

225
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:55,368


226
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,599
It better be, 'cause anybody so much as
thinks of those saddlebags...

227
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:58,688


228
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:00,759
And you're a dead man. Got it?

229
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:00,888


230
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,037
You.

231
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:20,968


232
00:14:20,968 --> 00:14:22,641
Where're you going?

233
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,048


234
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:25,800
I gotta water the flowers.

235
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:25,888


236
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:28,448
There's a chamber pot under the bed.

237
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:29,688


238
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:33,124
A gentleman never relieves
himself in front of a lady.

239
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:33,408


240
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,287
You see you a lady anywhere,
you let me know.

241
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,728


242
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:39,446
Don't go anywhere, please.

243
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:57,768


244
00:14:57,768 --> 00:14:59,247
You was fast.

245
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:00,168


246
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:02,284
Got here as soon as I could.

247
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:25,848


248
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:28,647
Since I already paid for the night...

249
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:29,608


250
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:31,440
What do you say we have...

251
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,528


252
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:32,882
<i>A</i> little reprise?

253
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:45,128


254
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:47,927
Hey, what do you
have your clothes on for?

255
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:48,448


256
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,281
- How did you get in here?
- I want my money.

257
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:51,728


258
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:54,481
Well, that's an interesting
way of putting it.

259
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:54,568


260
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:58,084
- As I recall, that's Wells Fargo's money.
-Not anymore, it ain't.

261
00:15:58,084 --> 00:15:58,528


262
00:15:58,528 --> 00:15:59,518
What?

263
00:15:59,518 --> 00:15:59,608


264
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:00,643
It's Latin.

265
00:16:00,643 --> 00:16:00,728


266
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,446
Loosely translated, it means:

267
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:02,528


268
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,166
"I stole that money fair and square."

269
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:04,248


270
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:05,682
Yeah, fancy pants?

271
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:05,768


272
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:09,318
I seem to remember you saying the
scratch belongs to the one with the gun.

273
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:09,408


274
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:13,402
In case you ain't noticed,
this Remington's staring at your face.

275
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:13,608


276
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,406
Well, that may be so.

277
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:15,488


278
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,684
But I have another gun
under this pillow here...

279
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:17,768


280
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,806
And it's staring at your
much more beautiful face.

281
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:22,568


282
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:23,842
Do you now?

283
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:24,808


284
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,321
I truly do, ma'am.

285
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:26,568


286
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,798
So whichever one of us gets hit first...

287
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:28,888


288
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,483
Tenses, pulls the trigger, then we both die.

289
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:33,888


290
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:36,004
Well, that's an interesting idea.

291
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:36,088


292
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,318
If you had bullets in that gun.

293
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:44,968


294
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:47,801
What'd you think I was doing
while you were in the shitter?

295
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:47,888


296
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:49,686
Swapping fingers with Miss Lorelei?

297
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:49,768


298
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:52,044
Think I'd leave that gun loaded?

299
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,328


300
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,046
I don't believe you.

301
00:16:58,046 --> 00:16:58,128


302
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:01,041
Well, sir, is that a chance
you want to take?

303
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:23,248


304
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:25,478
Well, you are something, ain't you?

305
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:25,568


306
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:27,605
Now, where's my money?

307
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,488


308
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:31,286
It's downstairs in the safe.

309
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:31,488


310
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:32,808
Don't make me stupid.

311
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:32,888


312
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:34,845
I wouldn't wanna do that.

313
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:38,008


314
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,601
What is this thing?

315
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,048


316
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:43,404
- That's a farming implement.
- Yeah? What's it do?

317
00:17:43,404 --> 00:17:46,608


318
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,158
It fixes the ground,
and, you know, makes things.

319
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,248


320
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:54,717
- Yeah.
- Right.

321
00:17:54,717 --> 00:18:05,088


322
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:06,158
Excuse me.

323
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:06,928


324
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:10,808
Sorry to bother you at this late hour
but I need my saddlebags.

325
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:15,208


326
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,767
Is there a problem?

327
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:17,448


328
00:18:17,448 --> 00:18:18,438
Get down!

329
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:21,528


330
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:24,247
Speakes, I got them!
They are over herein the bar.

331
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:24,328


332
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:26,524
- What the hell are you doing?
- I want that money.

333
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:26,608


334
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,918
Don't you want your damn life? Come on!

335
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:31,248


336
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:33,319
You ran them off, didn't you?

337
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:33,408


338
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:35,240
I thought you was out front.

339
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,368


340
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:36,563
You're a dip.

341
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:39,808


342
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:40,878
Get on!

343
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:42,368


344
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:43,517
Leave it.

345
00:18:43,517 --> 00:19:41,168


346
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:44,286
We're all right for now.
It looks pretty clear.

347
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:44,488


348
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:47,241
You almost got me killed back there,
you idiot.

349
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:47,328


350
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:50,002
Yeah? You didn't have to stop, did you?

351
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:50,888


352
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,799
Yeah. Well, we're even.

353
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,368


354
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:58,438
Even.

355
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,648


356
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,162
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

357
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:02,248


358
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,125
- My husband.
- A husband?

359
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,808


360
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,880
And where might that poor
soul-suffering gentleman be?

361
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:08,968


362
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:11,960
- We stopped seeing eye to eye.
- I can see why.

363
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,608


364
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:13,757
So where're you going?

365
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:13,848


366
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,998
- Away from you.
- Well, now, just hold on.

367
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:16,088


368
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:19,718
- From where I stand you owe me $2,500.
- I don't owe you nothing.

369
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:19,808


370
00:20:19,808 --> 00:20:20,878
You do. After all...

371
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:20,968


372
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:23,687
I lost all that money because
he was following you, not me.

373
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:23,768


374
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,167
Hey, get down there.

375
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:25,248


376
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:27,478
You're lucky I don't kill you.

377
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:27,848


378
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:30,408
That was my money and my last chance.

379
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:30,968


380
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:33,244
Well, maybe we can make a deal.

381
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:33,408


382
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:36,844
- I could use some assistance.
- You need more than that.

383
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,088


384
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,557
I've been planning this particular job...

385
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:40,648


386
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:42,685
- This bank job. And--
- I stole to live.

387
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:42,768


388
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:45,362
- I ain't no robber.
- I'll say you ain't.

389
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:45,448


390
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:46,961
So, what're you gonna do?

391
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:47,048


392
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,608
A woman alone out here
in the middle of the wilderness?

393
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:49,688


394
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:50,883
None of your beeswax.

395
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:50,968


396
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,528
You don't even have a plan, do you?

397
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:53,808


398
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:55,765
Do you?

399
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:56,488


400
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,887
No, you don't.

401
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:58,088


402
00:20:58,088 --> 00:21:00,398
You don't even know what you're doing.

403
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:00,488


404
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:01,762
Of course I do.

405
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:01,848


406
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:04,647
You got a plan? What is it?

407
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:05,008


408
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:07,318
I'm starting a cattle ranch, Mr. Nosybody.

409
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:07,408


410
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:09,558
A cattle ranch. Now, that's a great idea.

411
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:09,648


412
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,366
Where are you gonna get the money?

413
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:11,448


414
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:14,247
You want your freedom,
you gotta have money.

415
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,408


416
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,605
You partner with me
and you're gonna have plenty of it.

417
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:19,688


418
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,645
Fine. What's your stupid idea?

419
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:22,808


420
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:23,957
Okay-

421
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:24,688


422
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:26,440
Six days from now...

423
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,808


424
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:29,527
Wells Fargo's gonna be
bringing in $75,000.

425
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:29,608


426
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:31,679
Now, with half that money...

427
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:31,768


428
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:34,328
You can buy all the cattle you want.

429
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:34,488


430
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:35,683
Where's the bank?

431
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:35,768


432
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:38,157
- You just trust me, okay?
- Right.

433
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:39,208


434
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,482
That's all there is to it?

435
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:40,568


436
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:43,560
We're gonna need a grubstake
if we're gonna, you know...

437
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,648


438
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:44,763
You play any poker?

439
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:44,848


440
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:47,078
Poker? I thought you said rob a bank.

441
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:47,208


442
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:51,805
The best way to get money out of a bank
is to put money in the bank. Get it?

443
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,608


444
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:57,124
Fine. I partner with you,
I get my money, and I'm gone.

445
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:57,488


446
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:58,967
That's a deal.

447
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:02,448


448
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:04,837
- Jack Cooper.
- Sarah O'Rourke.

449
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:06,568


450
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:07,797
One thing, partner.

451
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:07,888


452
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:11,563
This here's a business relationship.
I sleep alone. Get it?

453
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:11,848


454
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:13,247
I do, too.

455
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:15,048


456
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:16,163
Good.

457
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:20,408


458
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:25,005
Wells Fargo's offering $2,500 bounty
for the man and woman who've clone this.

459
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:25,128


460
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:27,438
They can be alive, they can be dead.

461
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:27,528


462
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:30,247
I'm moving out of here in 10 minutes.

463
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:30,328


464
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:34,287
Anyone who comes with me has
that reward. I don't want a penny of it.

465
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:34,368


466
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:36,405
What the hell have they done exactly?

467
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:36,488


468
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,957
You and him done all the shooting.

469
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:39,408


470
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:41,922
They robbed the stage, didn't they?

471
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:42,048


472
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:44,039
And they run off my wife.

473
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:44,128


474
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:46,358
God's gentlest creature
up and run from me...

475
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:46,448


476
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,724
After being influenced by them criminals.

477
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:48,808


478
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:51,277
And, by God, they done this to me.

479
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:51,488


480
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:52,842
Like as not you deserved it.

481
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:52,928


482
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,885
What did you say, mister?

483
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:55,888


484
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:57,606
You did deserve it.

485
00:22:57,606 --> 00:22:57,928


486
00:22:57,928 --> 00:23:00,204
But a good boy from Gatesville didn't.

487
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:00,808


488
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:04,278
That woman shot that boy to death
as cold as you please.

489
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:05,328


490
00:23:05,328 --> 00:23:06,762
Some of you gotta have families.

491
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:06,848


492
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:09,806
You want that kind of people
roaming these parts?

493
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:11,528


494
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:14,327
- Who's coming with me?
- That reward.

495
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:15,368


496
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:17,803
All's we got to do is go with you?

497
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:18,808


498
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:21,846
You ain't gonna get that money
for doing nothing.

499
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:21,928


500
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:24,727
I'll deputize you, and I'll work you hard...

501
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:24,808


502
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:26,765
But I'll do the killing.

503
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:27,888


504
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:32,041
Seems to me like the only thing
you're good at killing is my windows.

505
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,168


506
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:36,284
You, funnyman.

507
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:36,808


508
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:38,162
Come here.

509
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:43,408


510
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,968
Have you got a safe in this shithole?

511
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:46,048


512
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:48,517
It's in there, but it's busted.

513
00:23:48,517 --> 00:23:48,608


514
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:50,042
I thought so.

515
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:50,608


516
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:53,964
As Marshall, I'm confiscating
the contents as evidence.

517
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:54,048


518
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:56,085
Marshall, you can't just come in here and--

519
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:56,168


520
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,557
That boy took $2,500 off that stagecoach...

521
00:23:58,557 --> 00:23:58,648


522
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:00,844
But he rode out of here empty.

523
00:24:00,844 --> 00:24:00,928


524
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:03,807
I reckon it's sitting in your safe right now.

525
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:03,888


526
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,801
That's crazy, Marshall.
And you can't prove nothing.

527
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:06,888


528
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:08,799
You know what proof is, mister?

529
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:08,968


530
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:12,120
Proofs you lying on this floor
with a bullet in your head.

531
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,208


532
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:15,087
You want to keep that money?
Then come with me.

533
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:15,328


534
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,845
Otherwise, I'm gonna shoot you for
withholding evidence and petty larceny.

535
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:22,288


536
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:24,006
Well, what'll it be?

537
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,888


538
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:30,084
I get part of that reward, too?

539
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:32,568


540
00:24:32,568 --> 00:24:33,967
If you live.

541
00:24:33,967 --> 00:25:17,768


542
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:18,883
Call.

543
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:21,168


544
00:25:21,168 --> 00:25:22,602
Let's see them.

545
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:24,208


546
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,643
Well, I got three dunces.

547
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:27,448


548
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:29,007
That's deuces.

549
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:29,168


550
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:31,762
Sorry, Mr. Honey,
but I'm afraid your "dunces"...

551
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:31,848


552
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:35,079
Can't afford passage
on this "boat" of mine.

553
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,168


554
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:36,397
Thank you very much.

555
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:36,488


556
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:38,638
You've heard of the luck of the Irish?

557
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:38,728


558
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:42,437
Well, tonight, my friends, you've seen it,
Mother of God.

559
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:42,528


560
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:45,520
It's your deal. Try to keep the faces down.

561
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,888


562
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,401
Ante up, boy.

563
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:49,488


564
00:25:49,488 --> 00:25:50,558
Okay-

565
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:51,608


566
00:25:51,608 --> 00:25:53,724
What are we gonna play here?

567
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:55,808


568
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:57,765
What shall we play? How about...

569
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,088


570
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:01,204
Seven Card Draw?

571
00:26:01,204 --> 00:26:02,368


572
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,564
Why don't we keep it to Five Card Draw?

573
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:04,648


574
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,924
We're traditionalists, you see.

575
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:13,488


576
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,683
Deal.

577
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:15,128


578
00:26:15,128 --> 00:26:17,688
Why don't you rein in
on that there, sonny?

579
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:17,768


580
00:26:17,768 --> 00:26:19,088
Your luck might change.

581
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:19,168


582
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:22,604
Sir, if you had a wife like mine
you'd be drinking, too.

583
00:26:22,604 --> 00:26:38,288


584
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:39,687
Here we go.

585
00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:47,648


586
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,968
Oh, sweet heaven above...

587
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:57,168


588
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:58,841
Would that be herself, now?

589
00:26:58,841 --> 00:26:58,928


590
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:01,078
She's a lovely, handsome woman.

591
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:01,168


592
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:03,842
I'm thinking maybe you're not
man enough to handle her.

593
00:27:03,842 --> 00:27:03,928


594
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:07,284
I think maybe you should
keep your opinions to yourself, sir.

595
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:07,568


596
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:09,684
He's a terror when he's roused.

597
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:09,768


598
00:27:09,768 --> 00:27:11,725
What in Sam Hill are you doing, Phineas?

599
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:11,808


600
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:14,118
You promised me you weren't
gonna do this no more.

601
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:14,208


602
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,403
Arrabella, my little flower.

603
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:15,488


604
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:17,638
Don't you "little flower" me,
you no good drunk.

605
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:17,728


606
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:19,207
How much you lose this time?

607
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:19,288


608
00:27:19,288 --> 00:27:20,562
He's still got his shirt on.

609
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:20,648


610
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:23,640
But it would seem that
she wears the trousers.

611
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,248


612
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:27,047
Room enough for me
in them trousers, ma'am?

613
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:27,128


614
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,199
I've a mind to squirm in.

615
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:30,168


616
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,762
Why don't you shut your filthy mouth?

617
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:33,208


618
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:35,119
Why don't you get the hell out of here...

619
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:35,208


620
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,881
So your husband can lose in peace?

621
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:36,968


622
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:39,164
Why don't you try and make me?

623
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:41,208


624
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,722
Dear, we don't wanna ruin the game here.

625
00:27:43,722 --> 00:27:43,808


626
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:45,207
It's going really well.

627
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:45,288


628
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,120
I believe I will try and make you.

629
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,208


630
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,607
Hold on!

631
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:50,168


632
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,239
What the hell you got under there?

633
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:52,768


634
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:54,998
Why, you cheating son of a bitch.

635
00:27:54,998 --> 00:28:09,408


636
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:11,638
Excuse me, ma'am. What happened here?

637
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:11,728


638
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:13,844
- They was cheating.
- All of them?

639
00:28:13,844 --> 00:28:13,928


640
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:15,521
All of them. Ain't that right?

641
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:15,608


642
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:17,360
Right as rain, ma'am.

643
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:17,648


644
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:19,002
All right.

645
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:20,528


646
00:28:20,528 --> 00:28:24,681
Go on, sweetheart. Gather up your money
and let's get out of here.

647
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:25,728


648
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,924
Thank you. It was nice playing.

649
00:28:27,924 --> 00:28:28,008


650
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:29,681
You, too, my friend.

651
00:28:29,681 --> 00:29:43,568


652
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:46,208
- Who's there?
-It's me. Your partner.

653
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:51,368


654
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:53,086
Well, ain't you fancy.

655
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:55,048


656
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:57,324
You don't think it looks good?

657
00:29:57,324 --> 00:29:57,648


658
00:29:57,648 --> 00:30:00,481
You worry about the way you look
more than most girls I know.

659
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:00,568


660
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:02,206
Is that how you're spending my money?

661
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:02,288


662
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:05,201
It's our money.
Besides, it's an investment.

663
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:05,608


664
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:08,566
And, I got you a little something, too.

665
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:13,608


666
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:14,643
What is it?

667
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:14,728


668
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:17,117
Why don't you shake it up and see?

669
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:24,528


670
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:27,646
It's a sort of start for your cattle ranch.

671
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:31,528


672
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:32,757
Like it?

673
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:35,888


674
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:37,083
Thanks.

675
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:42,368


676
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:45,406
So what do you need money so bad for?
You said you're a farmer?

677
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:45,488


678
00:30:45,488 --> 00:30:47,638
Well, I am. Or I'm gonna be.

679
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:48,048


680
00:30:48,048 --> 00:30:50,244
In the meantime,
you just rob people, right?

681
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:50,328


682
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:53,161
Sometimes you gotta do
some wrong to do some good.

683
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:53,248


684
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:56,479
Yeah? What the hell did you ever do
that was so good?

685
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:56,648


686
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,800
You don't know me.
Maybe I've done a lot of good.

687
00:30:59,800 --> 00:30:59,968


688
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:02,278
If you're feeling so guilty,
maybe you ought to...

689
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:02,368


690
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:04,518
Go out and find that Marshall
friend of yours...

691
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:04,608


692
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:06,087
And get yourself hung.

693
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:06,168


694
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,567
What do you think you're doing?

695
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:07,648


696
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,878
My experience with safes
in the last few days...

697
00:31:09,878 --> 00:31:09,968


698
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,527
Have led me to doubt their efficacy.

699
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:11,608


700
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,918
- Cut the professor talk.
- Safes ain't safe.

701
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:14,008


702
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:17,000
- Yes. So why do you get to carry it?
Because I got the duster.

703
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,088


704
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:20,683
Look, a partnership is based on
mutual respect and a sense of trust.

705
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:20,768


706
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:24,124
Well, I trust you, Jack.
I'll just take my share now.

707
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:24,248


708
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:26,319
- Oh, Jesus God, woman.
- Now.

709
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,488


710
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,922
- All right.
- Come on.

711
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:29,008


712
00:31:29,008 --> 00:31:30,999
All right. Here you go.

713
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:31,288


714
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:32,767
Better put it someplace safe.

715
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:32,848


716
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:34,919
Like where, Mr. Mastermind?

717
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:35,208


718
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,482
You might try your bloomers.

719
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:36,568


720
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:38,525
Nothing else will be getting
in anytime soon.

721
00:31:38,525 --> 00:31:38,608


722
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:40,121
Nothing of yours, anyway.

723
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:40,208


724
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,722
So who's them boys in the daguerreotype?

725
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:42,808


726
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:45,527
Just mind your own
business and I'll mind mine, okay?

727
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:45,608


728
00:31:45,608 --> 00:31:48,521
Don't have to piss your britches.
I'm trying to make company.

729
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:48,608


730
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:49,723
God, you're so rude.

731
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:49,808


732
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:53,164
Okay. it's myself and my brother,
if you must know.

733
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:53,728


734
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:54,798
Yeah?

735
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:54,888


736
00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:57,801
And where's that poor soul-suffering fella?

737
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:59,328


738
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:00,602
He's dead.

739
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:03,128


740
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:04,641
Feel better now?

741
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:05,768


742
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,486
We were boys...

743
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:08,768


744
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:13,319
And we were playing back East. And
he dove in front of a wagon to save me.

745
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:13,408


746
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:15,081
He was a brilliant boy.

747
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:15,168


748
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:17,239
He was a brilliant scholar.

749
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,608


750
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:22,806
He was gifted in the natural sciences.
I couldn't hold a candle to him.

751
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:25,488


752
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:27,126
I'm really sorry.

753
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:28,368


754
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:31,645
If you need me, I'll be downstairs
laying in supplies.

755
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:31,728


756
00:32:31,728 --> 00:32:33,446
<i>I'll</i> go with you.

757
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:33,968


758
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:37,518
That's a good idea.
Maybe you can be of some assistance.

759
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:37,808


760
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:40,004
- God knows how.
- What's that?

761
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:40,208


762
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,324
I said it's time to go now.

763
00:32:42,324 --> 00:33:26,808


764
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,685
We supposed to sleep in this shithole?

765
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:28,768


766
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:31,681
Try the livery, if the horses will have you.

767
00:33:31,681 --> 00:34:21,408


768
00:34:21,408 --> 00:34:23,968
Speakes, I lay claim to that reward.

769
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:24,648


770
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,798
But they're here. I've seen them.

771
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:26,888


772
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:28,799
- Where?
- At the General Store.

773
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:28,928


774
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:32,478
I've seen them come out of the saloon
broad as daylight.

775
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:41,608


776
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:44,077
Katrin, give me Michael,
and get out of the wagon.

777
00:34:44,077 --> 00:34:44,168


778
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:46,079
I've got to push the wheels back...

779
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:46,168


780
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,728
And I needn't be lifting
your behind as well.

781
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:54,368


782
00:34:54,368 --> 00:34:57,724
Jacket's made of genuine India rubber.

783
00:34:57,724 --> 00:34:58,408


784
00:34:58,408 --> 00:35:01,400
Distracts the rain completely.
Wearing one of these...

785
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,488


786
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:03,559
Is like having a roof over your head.

787
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:03,648


788
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:06,959
Well, it's fine for folks too stupid
to get out of the rain.

789
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,288


790
00:35:09,288 --> 00:35:11,245
- That's good.
- She'll take one.

791
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:13,048


792
00:35:13,048 --> 00:35:14,880
So, what else you got here?

793
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,208


794
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,961
Take a look <i>at</i> some
of those Havana cigars.

795
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:18,128


796
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:19,527
Finest in the land.

797
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:41,128


798
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:43,039
Still in the Dry Goods.

799
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:43,368


800
00:35:43,368 --> 00:35:45,484
Hollister, Will, across the street.

801
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:45,568


802
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:47,161
Frenchy, Clyde, over there.

803
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:47,248


804
00:35:47,248 --> 00:35:48,841
Sanchez, inside.

805
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:54,888


806
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:57,118
Look at that. There.

807
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:58,448


808
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,847
Jesus Christ.

809
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:00,848


810
00:36:00,848 --> 00:36:05,001
He'd had to ride all night to get here.
What is it between you two?

811
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:06,488


812
00:36:06,488 --> 00:36:08,081
What're we gonna do?

813
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:08,168


814
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:11,923
Go over there and ask the nice gentleman
what kind of weapons he's got.

815
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:12,008


816
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:14,887
- Show me some of your weapons.
- Absolutely.

817
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:18,008


818
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:20,318
That there's a brand-new
Scattershot .44.

819
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:20,408


820
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:22,001
It's great for squirrel hunting.

821
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:22,088


822
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:24,921
Almost like making your
Winchester into a small bore shotgun.

823
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:25,008


824
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:27,204
- I'll take three boxes.
- How about a rifle?

825
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:27,288


826
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:28,483
I need two, actually.

827
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:28,568


828
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:30,400
You got the .44 carbine and .44-40?

829
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,488


830
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,479
44-40? Yes, indeed.

831
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:33,408


832
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:37,117
That 44-40 uses the same load
as a Colt pistol.

833
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:38,328


834
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:41,400
Makes life a whole lot easier.

835
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:41,528


836
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:43,997
Yeah. Why don't you show me
two of them Colts?

837
00:36:43,997 --> 00:36:44,088


838
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,442
Two Colts.

839
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:47,048


840
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,688
Boy, you sure are gonna love
these little fellas.

841
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:49,768


842
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:53,523
Hey, you folks wouldn't happen to be
from back East now, would you?

843
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:53,608


844
00:36:53,608 --> 00:36:55,519
- Boston.
- Boston.

845
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:55,688


846
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:57,804
Son of a gun. I knew it.

847
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:58,008


848
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,522
I'm from old New York myself.
Put her there.

849
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:02,408


850
00:37:02,408 --> 00:37:04,445
Yeah, Boston.

851
00:37:04,445 --> 00:37:05,648


852
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:06,683
Excuse me.

853
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:06,768


854
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,486
Boy, Boston.

855
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:08,888


856
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:10,959
Say, excuse me, is there anything wrong?

857
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:11,048


858
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:13,437
Not if you lie down
on the floor and shut up.

859
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:13,528


860
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,678
Yes, ma'am.
You don't have to tell me twice.

861
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:15,768


862
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:17,247
On your back, jughead.

863
00:37:17,247 --> 00:37:17,328


864
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:18,682
Don't want you crawling off.

865
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:18,768


866
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:21,442
- At your service.
- How many of them you said you seen?

867
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:21,528


868
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:23,087
Six, maybe seven. Against two.

869
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:23,168


870
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:25,637
Against one, really.
You ain't worth shit in a fracas.

871
00:37:25,637 --> 00:37:25,728


872
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:27,799
Why don't you just shoot some
of them for me?

873
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:27,888


874
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:29,117
What'll you be doing?

875
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:29,208


876
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,643
Like my fencing instructor used to say:

877
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:31,728


878
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:34,641
"Never underestimate the element
of surprise."

879
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:39,408


880
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:40,842
Let him have it!

881
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:55,848


882
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:58,761
Get out of there, God damn it!
Get off the street!

883
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:09,968


884
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,447
There's little children here.

885
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:11,528


886
00:38:11,528 --> 00:38:13,804
Hollister, watch them people.

887
00:38:13,804 --> 00:39:34,648


888
00:39:34,648 --> 00:39:35,763
I got him.

889
00:39:35,763 --> 00:39:36,208


890
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,040
I got him! I did it!

891
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,608


892
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:44,723
MY eyes.

893
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:53,608


894
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:54,757
Damn.

895
00:39:54,757 --> 00:40:03,328


896
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,046
Come on, woman. Come on.

897
00:40:05,046 --> 00:40:25,688


898
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:26,917
Speakes?

899
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:27,768


900
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,805
Speakes! Where are you, Speakes?

901
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:29,888


902
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,447
You done this to me.

903
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:31,528


904
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:33,201
Stop it, Hollister.

905
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:33,648


906
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:36,845
What about my eyes,
you goddamn son of a bitch?

907
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:38,888


908
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:41,641
Where's my reward, Speakes? Where?

909
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:42,328


910
00:40:42,328 --> 00:40:46,367
Damn it, man, I know you're hurting,
but it ain't no fault of mine.

911
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:47,968


912
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:49,038
Come on.

913
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:49,128


914
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:51,597
Just point me at him.

915
00:40:51,597 --> 00:40:51,688


916
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:53,201
Right here, Hollister.

917
00:40:53,201 --> 00:41:00,288


918
00:41:00,288 --> 00:41:01,517
Marshall...

919
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:02,048


920
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:04,324
There weren't no cause for that.

921
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:05,368


922
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:07,882
I did him a favor. Now get mounted.

923
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:45,288


924
00:41:45,288 --> 00:41:48,041
We can't stay here long.
They're gonna be right on us.

925
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:48,128


926
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:49,527
Don't you worry.

927
00:41:49,527 --> 00:41:49,608


928
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:52,077
Can't see this place in the day,
let alone at night.

929
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:52,168


930
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:53,158
Yeah.

931
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:54,648


932
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:55,797
Just lay still.

933
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:57,848


934
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,600
Lost a lot of blood.

935
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,408


936
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:04,365
It's gonna be all right.

937
00:42:04,365 --> 00:42:06,368


938
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:07,438
Don't worry.

939
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:07,528


940
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:10,202
Looks like the bullet passed right
through the fatty part.

941
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:10,288


942
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:11,278
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

943
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:11,368


944
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:13,644
Lucky it didn't puncture your systems.

945
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:22,768


946
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:24,281
You're gonna be fine.

947
00:42:24,281 --> 00:42:25,408


948
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,718
You know, you didn't have to stop.

949
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:28,368


950
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:30,518
You could've just kept right on going.

951
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:30,608


952
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:33,487
Could've just taken that money and gone.

953
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:34,488


954
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:35,922
I could have.

955
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:41,568


956
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:43,206
But what about--

957
00:42:43,206 --> 00:43:01,088


958
00:43:01,088 --> 00:43:03,967
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.

959
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:12,008


960
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,443
Why does Speakes want you so bad?

961
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:16,168


962
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:18,557
Seems like he wants you pretty bad, too.

963
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:18,648


964
00:43:18,648 --> 00:43:20,719
That's true enough. But...

965
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:21,328


966
00:43:21,328 --> 00:43:25,401
I believe you two were acquainted
when we first met, weren't you?

967
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,928


968
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:29,407
Well, weren't you?

969
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,968


970
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:36,562
There was this boy in my town.
He wanted to marry me.

971
00:43:36,562 --> 00:43:36,648


972
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:39,117
Guess he liked the way I looked
or something.

973
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:39,208


974
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:42,166
He had a big ranch,
or his daddy did, anyway.

975
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:42,968


976
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:45,164
I figured an orphan girl
could do much worse...

977
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:45,248


978
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,967
- Than become a cattle baron, right?
Baroness.

979
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:48,648


980
00:43:48,648 --> 00:43:49,922
Baroness.

981
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:51,888


982
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:53,117
Go on.

983
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:56,728


984
00:43:56,728 --> 00:43:59,447
Turned out this fella weren't no man at all.

985
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:00,088


986
00:44:00,088 --> 00:44:02,125
He started beating on me.

987
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,208


988
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:04,642
One thing I won't abide...

989
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:04,728


990
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,163
Man putting his hands on me
without my by-your-leave.

991
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:07,248


992
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:09,398
Don't take that from nobody.

993
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:11,288


994
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:14,679
So that's why he's after you,
'cause you killed your husband?

995
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:15,248


996
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:17,319
It weren't just my husband.

997
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:20,088


998
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:21,647
It was his boy.

999
00:44:21,647 --> 00:44:28,248


1000
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,717
That make a difference between us?

1001
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:32,048


1002
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:33,243
No.

1003
00:44:33,243 --> 00:45:23,888


1004
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,640
We'd better be moving.

1005
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,928


1006
00:45:28,928 --> 00:45:30,601
Is something wrong?

1007
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:31,408


1008
00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:34,560
I should've told you before,
I got some business to tend to...

1009
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:34,648


1010
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,719
And I'm gonna need to do it alone.

1011
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:37,728


1012
00:45:37,728 --> 00:45:39,480
What're you talking about, Cooper?

1013
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,568


1014
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:40,717
I thought we was partners.

1015
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:40,808


1016
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:44,483
I'll meet you at Monegaw, that's the town
with the bank, in three days, okay?

1017
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:44,568


1018
00:45:44,568 --> 00:45:48,448
Why didn't you tell me
about this little something yesterday?

1019
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:49,328


1020
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:51,080
Because it's none of your business.

1021
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:51,168


1022
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:52,158
I see.

1023
00:45:52,158 --> 00:45:52,288


1024
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:55,997
You got yourself a little wifey
somewhere, Cooper? Do you?

1025
00:45:55,997 --> 00:45:58,528


1026
00:45:58,528 --> 00:45:59,848
All right, fine.

1027
00:45:59,848 --> 00:46:00,088


1028
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:04,082
- Just give me my share of the money.
- You already lost your share.

1029
00:46:04,082 --> 00:46:05,248


1030
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:07,398
You give me what's left, Cooper.

1031
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,288


1032
00:46:08,288 --> 00:46:11,838
I don't think you're gonna find
any bullets in that gun.

1033
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,848


1034
00:46:15,848 --> 00:46:18,806
It's a little trick I learned from someone.

1035
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:19,848


1036
00:46:19,848 --> 00:46:20,918
Trust.

1037
00:46:20,918 --> 00:46:21,008


1038
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:24,285
- That's what you're always saying.
- Look, I trust you.

1039
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:24,368


1040
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:26,564
It's just something
I need to do alone, okay?

1041
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:26,648


1042
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:28,446
After what we done, Jack?

1043
00:46:28,446 --> 00:46:29,128


1044
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:31,642
You're just a liar, like the rest of them.

1045
00:46:31,642 --> 00:46:31,728


1046
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:33,287
Come on, Sarah. God damn it!

1047
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:33,368


1048
00:46:33,368 --> 00:46:36,918
- I need to do this alone!
- You lie, and you pretend...

1049
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:37,008


1050
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:39,124
And you just do what you want.

1051
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:43,648


1052
00:46:43,648 --> 00:46:45,241
All right. Okay.

1053
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:48,128


1054
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:51,837
- I'm going to my brother's ranch.
- Your brother's dead.

1055
00:46:51,837 --> 00:46:53,768


1056
00:46:53,768 --> 00:46:55,918
He's not dead. He's alive.

1057
00:46:55,918 --> 00:46:56,368


1058
00:46:56,368 --> 00:46:59,565
But you said he was dead.
Why did you lie about it?

1059
00:46:59,565 --> 00:46:59,648


1060
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:02,640
I don't want him to get mixed up
in the things I do. I just...

1061
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:02,728


1062
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:05,686
I wanna protect him.
You can understand that, can't you?

1063
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:05,768


1064
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:07,725
You didn't have to lie about it.

1065
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:16,008


1066
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:17,237
Walter?

1067
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:36,288


1068
00:47:36,288 --> 00:47:36,925
Hey, there!

1069
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:41,728


1070
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:43,127
How are you?

1071
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:43,928


1072
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:47,159
- I heard you were sick.
- Yes, indeed I was. But...

1073
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:47,688


1074
00:47:47,688 --> 00:47:50,521
At present, I'm full of beans, as they say.

1075
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:50,688


1076
00:47:50,688 --> 00:47:52,918
I've been taking garlic
and a touch of kerosene...

1077
00:47:52,918 --> 00:47:53,008


1078
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:56,364
<i>A</i> remedy of my own invention.
I've had visions, Jackie.

1079
00:47:56,364 --> 00:47:56,448


1080
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:59,600
Let's go. Come on. Get out of bed.

1081
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,368


1082
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:04,760
No wonder you're not feeling good.
Look at this place. it's a damn mess.

1083
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,688


1084
00:48:06,688 --> 00:48:07,962
Madam...

1085
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:09,008


1086
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:11,397
My appearance is...

1087
00:48:11,397 --> 00:48:13,208


1088
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:16,326
You are the first animal...

1089
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:16,968


1090
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:19,005
Vegetable or mineral that...

1091
00:48:19,005 --> 00:48:19,088


1092
00:48:19,088 --> 00:48:23,002
My dear brother
has ever deigned to bring back...

1093
00:48:23,002 --> 00:48:23,088


1094
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:27,002
To our humble little ranch.
You must be very special.

1095
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:33,088


1096
00:48:33,088 --> 00:48:36,718
Walter, this is Mamie, Mamie Hollister.

1097
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:38,968


1098
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:42,518
- Mamie, this is my brother, Walter.
- Pleased to meet you.

1099
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:42,768


1100
00:48:42,768 --> 00:48:43,803
Oh, no.

1101
00:48:43,803 --> 00:48:46,728


1102
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:48,605
The pleasure...

1103
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:48,808


1104
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:50,560
Is exclusively my own.

1105
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,648


1106
00:48:50,648 --> 00:48:53,083
Sweet, sweet lady.

1107
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:55,848


1108
00:48:55,848 --> 00:48:57,407
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

1109
00:48:57,407 --> 00:48:57,928


1110
00:48:57,928 --> 00:48:59,282
Did you bring it?

1111
00:48:59,282 --> 00:48:59,448


1112
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:02,247
What? Oh, yeah. Yep.

1113
00:49:02,247 --> 00:49:03,488


1114
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:04,842
There you go.

1115
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:08,608


1116
00:49:08,608 --> 00:49:11,202
Wait till you see it.

1117
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:11,968


1118
00:49:11,968 --> 00:49:16,007
- You are gonna be staying, aren't you?
- Well, we're gonna be heading out...

1119
00:49:16,007 --> 00:49:16,088


1120
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:17,487
Tomorrow probably.

1121
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:22,088


1122
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:25,968
- What in the hell is that, Marshall?
- Smells kind of like you.

1123
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:26,248


1124
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:28,603
Somebody pissed on it.

1125
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:29,208


1126
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:31,199
Well, there's a fresh fire.

1127
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:31,768


1128
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,088
And lots of blood.

1129
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:33,168


1130
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:36,445
How long ago you figure
they been here, Marshall?

1131
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:37,968


1132
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:39,641
Not long, I reckon.

1133
00:49:39,641 --> 00:50:15,528


1134
00:50:15,528 --> 00:50:17,280
What is that thing?

1135
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,648


1136
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,286
It's a telescope.

1137
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:20,768


1138
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,157
A Cassegrainian telescope.

1139
00:50:23,157 --> 00:50:24,128


1140
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:25,562
Can you believe it?

1141
00:50:25,562 --> 00:50:25,648


1142
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,958
- You told me that thing was for farming.
- What?

1143
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:28,048


1144
00:50:28,048 --> 00:50:31,643
- I almost got killed over a telescope?
- Hey, who're you poking?

1145
00:50:31,643 --> 00:50:31,728


1146
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,242
You can see the craters on the moon.

1147
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:34,528


1148
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:36,405
The Sea of Tranquility.

1149
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:36,648


1150
00:50:36,648 --> 00:50:39,686
- Isn't that a beautiful name?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

1151
00:50:39,686 --> 00:50:40,048


1152
00:50:40,048 --> 00:50:41,561
What's that hole doing in the roof?

1153
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:41,648


1154
00:50:41,648 --> 00:50:44,083
I gave you the money to fix it, didn't I?

1155
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:48,808


1156
00:50:48,808 --> 00:50:52,278
Not for you, not for me, but for us!

1157
00:50:52,278 --> 00:50:52,528


1158
00:50:52,528 --> 00:50:54,201
God, not another one.

1159
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,008


1160
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:57,885
The stars bespeak the glory of God!

1161
00:50:57,885 --> 00:50:57,968


1162
00:50:57,968 --> 00:51:01,404
Walter, would you stop with that shit!
You know, Walter, we had a deal.

1163
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:01,488


1164
00:51:01,488 --> 00:51:04,799
I was supposed to bring you that thing,
and you were to fix the barn!

1165
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:04,888


1166
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:08,199
Instead, you bust a bigger hole,
and you stick your telescope out here!

1167
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:08,288


1168
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:11,565
Jack, I had every intention, of course,
of fixing this roof.

1169
00:51:11,565 --> 00:51:11,648


1170
00:51:11,648 --> 00:51:13,685
- The telescope--
- The telescope!

1171
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:14,208


1172
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,438
There's a hole as big as a wagon
in the damn roof!

1173
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:16,528


1174
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:19,247
I don't know what the hell
is wrong with you!

1175
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:21,648


1176
00:51:21,648 --> 00:51:24,162
Sea of Tranquility is a pretty name.

1177
00:51:24,162 --> 00:51:29,648


1178
00:51:29,648 --> 00:51:31,525
Can I look through that thing?

1179
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:39,528


1180
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:42,486
Mother used to tell us...

1181
00:51:42,486 --> 00:51:43,328


1182
00:51:43,328 --> 00:51:45,842
That the stars are like God's teeth.

1183
00:51:45,842 --> 00:51:47,808


1184
00:51:47,808 --> 00:51:51,802
And shine. That they shine
whiter than the belly of a fish.

1185
00:51:51,802 --> 00:51:52,688


1186
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:55,680
And that you can always see the stars...

1187
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:55,768


1188
00:51:55,768 --> 00:51:58,362
Because God's always smiling.

1189
00:51:58,362 --> 00:52:03,968


1190
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:05,800
You and Jack are friends?

1191
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,088


1192
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:09,045
Yeah. Partner, friends.

1193
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:13,648


1194
00:52:13,648 --> 00:52:15,878
If you and he are partners...

1195
00:52:15,878 --> 00:52:16,008


1196
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,238
And he and I are partners...

1197
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:18,928


1198
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:22,364
Then therefore you and I
are partners, too, correct?

1199
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:23,328


1200
00:52:23,328 --> 00:52:25,001
Reckon that's so.

1201
00:52:25,001 --> 00:52:26,208


1202
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,482
Partner.

1203
00:52:27,482 --> 00:52:44,128


1204
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:45,926
Mamie Hollister, huh?

1205
00:52:45,926 --> 00:52:48,208


1206
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,403
Well, you seen him.

1207
00:52:49,403 --> 00:52:49,488


1208
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:51,638
You want everybody
in the territory knowing...

1209
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:51,728


1210
00:52:51,728 --> 00:52:53,685
You're passing by this way?

1211
00:52:53,685 --> 00:52:53,768


1212
00:52:53,768 --> 00:52:56,681
Well, he ain't gonna say nothing.
He's your brother.

1213
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:56,768


1214
00:52:56,768 --> 00:53:01,365
You've known him for five minutes.
You know him better than I do, don't you?

1215
00:53:01,365 --> 00:53:03,728


1216
00:53:03,728 --> 00:53:06,083
What happened to him?
I mean, with his leg?

1217
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:06,168


1218
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:09,684
We were boys. We were playing.
He got run over by a wagon.

1219
00:53:09,684 --> 00:53:09,768


1220
00:53:09,768 --> 00:53:11,884
- That's awful.
- Yes, it is.

1221
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:15,568


1222
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:18,162
You think this place is a shithole,
don't you?

1223
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:18,248


1224
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:19,886
I ain't said a word.

1225
00:53:19,886 --> 00:53:19,968


1226
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:23,165
You don't have to say it.
It's written all over your face.

1227
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:24,328


1228
00:53:24,328 --> 00:53:26,239
What are you talking about, Jack?

1229
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:26,328


1230
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,444
I think maybe it was a bad idea
you coming here.

1231
00:53:28,444 --> 00:53:28,528


1232
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:32,158
I think maybe you should've just gone
on to Monegaw by yourself.

1233
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:33,168


1234
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,604
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Nothing's the matter with me.

1235
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:36,688


1236
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:39,123
I don't like the way
you are looking at this place...

1237
00:53:39,123 --> 00:53:39,208


1238
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,802
You're looking at my brother
like he's some damn cripple.

1239
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:41,888


1240
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:43,401
You're the one who's picking on him.

1241
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:43,488


1242
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:45,877
Look, I'm not picking on him.
He and I had a deal...

1243
00:53:45,877 --> 00:53:45,968


1244
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:48,482
And he broke the deal.
And that's the way it is, okay?

1245
00:53:48,482 --> 00:53:48,568


1246
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:50,764
And this is none of your business.

1247
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:54,488


1248
00:53:54,488 --> 00:53:56,286
It was you, wasn't it?

1249
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:59,448


1250
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:03,407
You're the one who hurt him.
That's why you're acting so crazy.

1251
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:14,088


1252
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:16,648
Why is it that every time you bed down
with a woman...

1253
00:54:16,648 --> 00:54:16,728


1254
00:54:16,728 --> 00:54:20,039
She thinks she's entitled
to opinions in your affairs?

1255
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,048


1256
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:24,880
You go to hell, Jack.

1257
00:54:24,880 --> 00:55:14,328


1258
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:17,559
She's a very pretty girl.

1259
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:21,688


1260
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:25,568
But I imagine the two of you
are no longer partners.

1261
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:28,208


1262
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,881
I imagine not.

1263
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:55,888


1264
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:57,242
I wouldn't.

1265
00:55:57,242 --> 00:56:03,208


1266
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,404
You led me on a merry chase, girl.

1267
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,888


1268
00:56:06,888 --> 00:56:09,038
You gonna drop that gun or die?

1269
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:22,208


1270
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:25,326
- More apparatus for that looking scope?
-It's a special lens.

1271
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:25,408


1272
00:56:25,408 --> 00:56:28,400
- You can see Venus.
- Venus?

1273
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:28,488


1274
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,923
Daggit. I used to have a pair of bifocals.

1275
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:31,008


1276
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:32,840
They were stepped on and busted, though.

1277
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:32,928


1278
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:34,965
You can't keep nothing
in a house full of kids.

1279
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:35,048


1280
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:36,118
- Kids.
- The little packers.

1281
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:36,208


1282
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,846
They're the dickens.

1283
00:56:37,846 --> 00:56:38,088


1284
00:56:38,088 --> 00:56:40,443
Hey, Marshall, what you got there?

1285
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:42,248


1286
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:44,285
Present for the hangman.

1287
00:56:44,285 --> 00:56:45,648


1288
00:56:45,648 --> 00:56:47,878
Hanging a woman. Daggit.

1289
00:56:47,878 --> 00:56:48,728


1290
00:56:48,728 --> 00:56:51,368
Wow. She's a good-looking one, too.

1291
00:56:51,368 --> 00:56:53,768


1292
00:56:53,768 --> 00:56:54,917
I have to go.

1293
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:55,008


1294
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:58,126
What do you want me to do
with that big crate I got out back?

1295
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:58,208


1296
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,848
- I'll come for it tomorrow.
- Ought to stick around.

1297
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:00,928


1298
00:57:00,928 --> 00:57:04,125
Ain't every day
you get to see them hang a woman.

1299
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:18,448


1300
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:20,485
Jesus, Walter!
What in the hell are you doing?

1301
00:57:20,485 --> 00:57:20,568


1302
00:57:20,568 --> 00:57:22,002
You're gonna kill those animals!

1303
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:22,088


1304
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:24,284
- I saw her!
- Who?

1305
00:57:24,284 --> 00:57:24,368


1306
00:57:24,368 --> 00:57:25,403
- Your friend.
- Where?

1307
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:25,488


1308
00:57:25,488 --> 00:57:28,799
In town. They're gonna hang her!
She's all beat up.

1309
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:35,568


1310
00:57:35,568 --> 00:57:37,320
What are you gonna do?

1311
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:37,408


1312
00:57:37,408 --> 00:57:40,764
I'm gonna unload these supplies,
and then I'm gonna go finish the roof.

1313
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:40,848


1314
00:57:40,848 --> 00:57:44,318
What are you gonna do about her?
You can't just leave her there.

1315
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:45,968


1316
00:57:45,968 --> 00:57:47,879
She made a decision, Walter.

1317
00:57:47,879 --> 00:57:47,968


1318
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:51,359
- She dissolved the partnership, okay?
- She's still your friend.

1319
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,448


1320
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:54,679
- She's still your partner.
- She's a grown woman, Walter!

1321
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:54,768


1322
00:57:54,768 --> 00:57:57,521
Besides, I've got other responsibilities.

1323
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:58,208


1324
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,404
What other responsibilities?

1325
00:58:00,404 --> 00:58:00,848


1326
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:02,282
You, for one.

1327
00:58:02,282 --> 00:58:05,328


1328
00:58:05,328 --> 00:58:08,525
I'm not your responsibility, Jack.
I can take care of myself.

1329
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:08,608


1330
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:10,758
You can take care of yourself?

1331
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:11,888


1332
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,606
Look at this place, Walter.

1333
00:58:13,606 --> 00:58:13,728


1334
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:16,846
You don't think I could've repaired
that roof if I had a mind to?

1335
00:58:16,846 --> 00:58:16,928


1336
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:18,965
You're not doing or fixing anything for me!

1337
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:19,048


1338
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:20,846
- You're fixing it for yourself!
- Bullshit.

1339
00:58:20,846 --> 00:58:20,928


1340
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:23,078
- Everything I do, I do for you!
- I don't need it!

1341
00:58:23,078 --> 00:58:23,168


1342
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:26,479
I know where you get that money from.
I don't need it!

1343
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:26,568


1344
00:58:26,568 --> 00:58:28,161
You don't need it?

1345
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:28,688


1346
00:58:28,688 --> 00:58:32,204
That money buys you that telescope.
That money puts food on your table.

1347
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:32,288


1348
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:35,087
And when I'm out getting money,
what do you do?

1349
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:35,568


1350
00:58:35,568 --> 00:58:37,559
I'm looking at the stars.

1351
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:38,128


1352
00:58:38,128 --> 00:58:42,486
While you're out there robbing people
and killing them for their money!

1353
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:52,568


1354
00:58:52,568 --> 00:58:54,957
It's nice to have you around, Jack.

1355
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:57,288


1356
00:58:57,288 --> 00:59:01,202
I gotta leave something for you to do.
You never come around.

1357
00:59:01,202 --> 00:59:02,528


1358
00:59:02,528 --> 00:59:03,962
But I saw her.

1359
00:59:03,962 --> 00:59:05,448


1360
00:59:05,448 --> 00:59:07,485
She looked right through me.

1361
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:08,488


1362
00:59:08,488 --> 00:59:11,367
I haven't known her long,
but my guess is...

1363
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:11,568


1364
00:59:11,568 --> 00:59:15,641
She'd cut out her tongue before
she would tell them where you were.

1365
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:18,008


1366
00:59:18,008 --> 00:59:20,204
She'd do right by you, Jack.

1367
00:59:20,204 --> 00:59:23,128


1368
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:24,687
Partners or no.

1369
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:56,648


1370
00:59:56,648 --> 00:59:58,844
And on the toppermost floor...

1371
00:59:58,844 --> 00:59:59,608


1372
00:59:59,608 --> 01:00:01,565
We'll have special rooms...

1373
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:01,648


1374
01:00:01,648 --> 01:00:04,879
With five girls in each one, naked.

1375
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:05,008


1376
01:00:05,008 --> 01:00:07,602
- Good.
- And dancing for your pleasure.

1377
01:00:07,602 --> 01:00:09,648


1378
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,766
And we'll call it,
"Tommy Donnely's Whorehouse."

1379
01:00:12,766 --> 01:00:13,848


1380
01:00:13,848 --> 01:00:15,282
Just like that.

1381
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:24,248


1382
01:00:24,248 --> 01:00:27,320
If your brain was shit,
it wouldn't even smell.

1383
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,928


1384
01:00:28,928 --> 01:00:31,317
Who already has a business sense?

1385
01:00:31,317 --> 01:00:31,408


1386
01:00:31,408 --> 01:00:33,922
Who already owns a business
with whores in it?

1387
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:34,008


1388
01:00:34,008 --> 01:00:35,123
Sick whores.

1389
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:35,688


1390
01:00:35,688 --> 01:00:36,837
Sick.

1391
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:37,848


1392
01:00:37,848 --> 01:00:41,842
If we're gonna take that reward money
and fix up a brand-new whorehouse...

1393
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:41,928


1394
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:45,080
Then it ought to be called
"Clyde's Whorehouse."

1395
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,848


1396
01:00:45,848 --> 01:00:48,806
God damn it, shut up and play cards.

1397
01:00:48,806 --> 01:00:48,888


1398
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:51,607
Exactly. Let's play some damn cards.

1399
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:51,768


1400
01:00:51,768 --> 01:00:53,406
- Give me two.
- No.

1401
01:00:53,406 --> 01:01:00,968


1402
01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:02,959
How're you doing, missy?

1403
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:09,448


1404
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:10,927
Yeah, well...

1405
01:01:10,927 --> 01:01:13,688


1406
01:01:13,688 --> 01:01:15,361
Won't be long now.

1407
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:36,008


1408
01:01:36,008 --> 01:01:37,362
All right.

1409
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:46,168


1410
01:01:46,168 --> 01:01:47,966
You just make sure you pick up...

1411
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:48,048


1412
01:01:48,048 --> 01:01:51,359
That crate bright and early
tomorrow morning, okay?

1413
01:01:51,359 --> 01:02:47,408


1414
01:02:47,408 --> 01:02:48,762
Yes, ma'am.

1415
01:02:48,762 --> 01:02:49,808


1416
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:54,086
We'll wrap a necklace of good
Kentucky hemp around that neck of yours.

1417
01:02:54,086 --> 01:02:57,728


1418
01:02:57,728 --> 01:03:00,686
You ever heard the sound
a broken neck bone makes?

1419
01:03:00,686 --> 01:03:02,768


1420
01:03:02,768 --> 01:03:04,167
Like a carrot.

1421
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:08,608


1422
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:09,962
The only thing that scares me...

1423
01:03:09,962 --> 01:03:10,048


1424
01:03:10,048 --> 01:03:12,961
Is going to hell
and meeting up with your son again.

1425
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:16,048


1426
01:03:16,048 --> 01:03:18,005
You think you're funny.

1427
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:19,888


1428
01:03:19,888 --> 01:03:22,880
And you think what you did was right,
don't you?

1429
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,768


1430
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:30,078
The thing you got to realize...

1431
01:03:30,078 --> 01:03:31,768


1432
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:33,600
Is you killed my boy.

1433
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,888


1434
01:03:38,888 --> 01:03:42,677
His <i>momma</i> walked into that house
and saw what he looked like.

1435
01:03:42,677 --> 01:03:46,568


1436
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:49,321
You know
what it's like to have a child...

1437
01:03:49,321 --> 01:03:51,408


1438
01:03:51,408 --> 01:03:53,046
Raise your son...

1439
01:03:53,046 --> 01:03:54,848


1440
01:03:54,848 --> 01:03:56,600
Love your children?

1441
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,248


1442
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:00,682
No, you don't.

1443
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:02,608


1444
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:05,600
You haven't got any idea.
You didn't want to.

1445
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,288


1446
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:11,926
I held that boy.

1447
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:14,368


1448
01:04:14,368 --> 01:04:16,484
He almost died of influenza.

1449
01:04:16,484 --> 01:04:18,608


1450
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:22,966
I was up three nights running
when he was just a baby.

1451
01:04:22,966 --> 01:04:27,728


1452
01:04:27,728 --> 01:04:30,641
And to see him go off
with a woman like you.

1453
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:32,328


1454
01:04:32,328 --> 01:04:33,887
A woman like me?

1455
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:34,848


1456
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:38,523
Don't you think my <i>momma</i> and <i>my</i> daddy
held <i>me</i> in their arms once?

1457
01:04:38,523 --> 01:04:38,608


1458
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,600
Your son weren't no man.
A man don't do that.

1459
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,448


1460
01:04:42,448 --> 01:04:44,325
After what he done to me?

1461
01:04:44,325 --> 01:04:45,888


1462
01:04:45,888 --> 01:04:47,083
Shit.

1463
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,248


1464
01:04:49,248 --> 01:04:51,159
He's just like his daddy.

1465
01:04:51,159 --> 01:05:05,328


1466
01:05:05,328 --> 01:05:08,446
I'm gonna put that rope
around your neck myself.

1467
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:08,688


1468
01:05:08,688 --> 01:05:10,759
Just keep it in the family.

1469
01:05:10,759 --> 01:05:33,248


1470
01:05:33,248 --> 01:05:35,603
Well. What've we got here?

1471
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:40,488


1472
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:43,287
Looks like somebody
pulled your stinger out.

1473
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:44,208


1474
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:47,678
I'm gonna give you a piece of advice,
little bumblebee.

1475
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:48,528


1476
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:51,566
You better get shy of this girl.
She's gonna get you killed.

1477
01:05:51,566 --> 01:05:51,648


1478
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:54,242
Seems like she's done some killing herself.

1479
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:59,408


1480
01:05:59,408 --> 01:06:03,527
Sir, I don't believe you're gonna be
stinging anybody for a long while.

1481
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:15,368


1482
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:17,439
Goddamn, I like this work.

1483
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:20,768


1484
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:23,726
Whitaker, keep an eye on these prisoners.

1485
01:06:23,726 --> 01:06:25,248


1486
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:27,398
I believe I deserve a whiskey.

1487
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:28,688


1488
01:06:28,688 --> 01:06:30,964
- Are you boys thirsty?
- You bet.

1489
01:06:30,964 --> 01:06:36,768


1490
01:06:36,768 --> 01:06:38,884
That was a dumb thing to do!

1491
01:06:38,884 --> 01:06:38,968


1492
01:06:38,968 --> 01:06:41,960
You didn't help me
and you sure didn't help yourself.

1493
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,048


1494
01:06:42,048 --> 01:06:44,801
- You idiot!
- Shut up and leave him alone in there!

1495
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:44,888


1496
01:06:44,888 --> 01:06:45,958
Jesus!

1497
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:46,048


1498
01:06:46,048 --> 01:06:48,324
You'll both be dangling soon enough.

1499
01:06:48,324 --> 01:07:06,328


1500
01:07:06,328 --> 01:07:09,525
- You got a cigarette?
- Go to hell.

1501
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,768


1502
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:12,964
Come on, can't you be civilized?

1503
01:07:12,964 --> 01:07:13,048


1504
01:07:13,048 --> 01:07:15,608
You're gonna see me hanging
in two hours.

1505
01:07:15,608 --> 01:07:22,688


1506
01:07:22,688 --> 01:07:27,000
Guess there ain't no reason
can't practice a little Christian charity.

1507
01:07:27,000 --> 01:08:30,808


1508
01:08:30,808 --> 01:08:33,766
- Well, boys, how're you feeling?
- Good. Real good.

1509
01:08:33,766 --> 01:08:33,848


1510
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:35,407
- Glad it's over.
- Fine.

1511
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:36,528


1512
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:39,441
- Good job, Marshall.
- When do we get our money?

1513
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:39,528


1514
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:40,723
Money?

1515
01:08:40,723 --> 01:08:41,128


1516
01:08:41,128 --> 01:08:43,244
Here's your money, Clyde.

1517
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,368


1518
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:46,961
Give me that bottle.

1519
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:48,488


1520
01:08:48,488 --> 01:08:52,447
Come on, Donnely. Where's your liver?
Situation's under control.

1521
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:53,688


1522
01:08:53,688 --> 01:08:57,761
After all we been through,
you're gonna blow us to kingdom come?

1523
01:08:57,761 --> 01:08:57,848


1524
01:08:57,848 --> 01:08:59,122
Yes, sir.

1525
01:08:59,122 --> 01:09:01,608


1526
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:04,202
Jesus Christ.

1527
01:09:04,202 --> 01:09:05,208


1528
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,801
Exploding sand.

1529
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:12,208


1530
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:13,960
Son of a bitch!

1531
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,528


1532
01:09:15,528 --> 01:09:19,806
Weren't never meant to blow up!
Bastard's got something else in mind!

1533
01:09:19,806 --> 01:09:22,888


1534
01:09:22,888 --> 01:09:24,765
You got a cup of water?

1535
01:09:24,765 --> 01:09:25,328


1536
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:29,686
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Do without!
Only make you piss.

1537
01:09:29,686 --> 01:09:32,488


1538
01:09:32,488 --> 01:09:34,525
For God sake! I only asked for
a cup of water.

1539
01:09:34,525 --> 01:09:34,608


1540
01:09:34,608 --> 01:09:37,441
You ain't gonna deny
a man his last wish, are you?

1541
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:44,088


1542
01:09:44,088 --> 01:09:47,524
After the dance
we done on your kidneys last night...

1543
01:09:47,524 --> 01:09:47,968


1544
01:09:47,968 --> 01:09:50,642
- Expect it to come out red.
- Obliged.

1545
01:09:50,642 --> 01:10:10,288


1546
01:10:10,288 --> 01:10:13,201
Whitaker? Where'd they go?

1547
01:10:13,201 --> 01:10:13,288


1548
01:10:13,288 --> 01:10:15,279
Wake up and talk, or so help me I'll--

1549
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:15,368


1550
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:18,281
Killing him ain't gonna find them,
Marshall.

1551
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:21,688


1552
01:10:21,688 --> 01:10:24,885
Get torches.
They ain't got far. Check the livery!

1553
01:10:24,885 --> 01:10:26,688


1554
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:29,487
You worthless piece of shit. I had her!

1555
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:43,728


1556
01:10:43,728 --> 01:10:45,526
Here you go. Take this.

1557
01:10:45,526 --> 01:10:57,128


1558
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,519
Not at the livery stable.
They're nowhere else, neither.

1559
01:11:00,519 --> 01:11:00,728


1560
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:02,765
All right. Get the horses.

1561
01:11:02,765 --> 01:11:02,968


1562
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:04,720
Go on! Get mounted!

1563
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,048


1564
01:11:06,048 --> 01:11:08,198
I'm going to find you, whore!

1565
01:11:08,198 --> 01:11:09,048


1566
01:11:09,048 --> 01:11:12,245
You too, boy. I'm gonna kill you both!

1567
01:11:12,245 --> 01:11:35,408


1568
01:11:35,408 --> 01:11:36,728
Who's there?

1569
01:11:36,728 --> 01:11:39,648


1570
01:11:39,648 --> 01:11:42,367
Daggit, Mr. Cooper, it's the crack of day.

1571
01:11:42,367 --> 01:11:42,448


1572
01:11:42,448 --> 01:11:44,439
I need that big crate.

1573
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:44,528


1574
01:11:44,528 --> 01:11:48,806
If I can set up early enough, I could
possibly get set up by this evening.

1575
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:48,888


1576
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:52,438
You worry about them damn stars
like some men worries about women.

1577
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:52,528


1578
01:11:52,528 --> 01:11:55,964
- The stars are the eternal verity.
- Yeah, well so is some women.

1579
01:11:55,964 --> 01:11:56,048


1580
01:11:56,048 --> 01:11:59,598
I had this girl bite me so hard once.
Bit me right there on the tit.

1581
01:11:59,598 --> 01:11:59,688


1582
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:02,760
Left a horseshoe-shaped scar.
Shaped like a half moon.

1583
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:02,848


1584
01:12:02,848 --> 01:12:04,441
Shaped like that.

1585
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:04,528


1586
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:07,247
Still hurts me when the weather gets cold.
You wanna see it?

1587
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:07,328


1588
01:12:07,328 --> 01:12:10,844
- But what I would like is that crate.
- All right. If that's what you want.

1589
01:12:10,844 --> 01:12:10,928


1590
01:12:10,928 --> 01:12:12,805
My back's been hurting me,
though, you know.

1591
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:12,888


1592
01:12:12,888 --> 01:12:16,165
Had this little piebald mare.
Threw me up in a peach tree.

1593
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:16,248


1594
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,159
- Took three little boys to get me down.
- No.

1595
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:18,248


1596
01:12:18,248 --> 01:12:21,001
- Had to use a well rope and well pulley.
- You know...

1597
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:21,088


1598
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:24,160
- The crate.
- All right. If that's what you want.

1599
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:30,168


1600
01:12:30,168 --> 01:12:34,162
- Are you all right in there, Jack?
- We're almost dead! Get us out!

1601
01:12:34,162 --> 01:12:34,808


1602
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:38,767
- Good God! What'd they do to you?
- You should see the other guy.

1603
01:12:38,767 --> 01:12:41,048


1604
01:12:41,048 --> 01:12:42,641
<i>That ain't true, is it?</i>

1605
01:12:42,641 --> 01:12:42,728


1606
01:12:42,728 --> 01:12:44,878
- Yes, it is.
- Very true, yes.

1607
01:12:44,878 --> 01:12:44,968


1608
01:12:44,968 --> 01:12:46,686
However, a very unfortunate account...

1609
01:12:46,686 --> 01:12:46,768


1610
01:12:46,768 --> 01:12:50,204
That I'm sure our lovely guest is not
in the least interested in hearing.

1611
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:50,288


1612
01:12:50,288 --> 01:12:52,564
This chicken is delicious, Mamie.

1613
01:12:52,564 --> 01:12:53,448


1614
01:12:53,448 --> 01:12:55,086
My name's Sarah.

1615
01:12:55,086 --> 01:12:55,808


1616
01:12:55,808 --> 01:12:58,118
All right. You may change your name.

1617
01:12:58,118 --> 01:12:58,208


1618
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,687
And you two...

1619
01:12:59,687 --> 01:12:59,968


1620
01:12:59,968 --> 01:13:02,960
Will be a great help in my investigations.

1621
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,088


1622
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:05,807
What about that deal in Monegaw, Jack?

1623
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:09,008


1624
01:13:09,008 --> 01:13:12,285
We really need to be moving out.
So, it won't wait.

1625
01:13:12,285 --> 01:13:14,328


1626
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:16,558
- You'll be coming back?
- Well...

1627
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:17,808


1628
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:20,163
Sure, we'll be coming back. But...

1629
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,448


1630
01:13:21,448 --> 01:13:23,439
Want some more chicken?

1631
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:38,328


1632
01:13:38,328 --> 01:13:42,083
If you want to load that pistol,
we ain't got a lot of time.

1633
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:51,008


1634
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:52,328
I'm done.

1635
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,568


1636
01:13:53,568 --> 01:13:56,082
No, you ain't. You got to load the pistol.

1637
01:13:56,082 --> 01:13:56,168


1638
01:13:56,168 --> 01:13:58,045
No. I mean, I'm finished.

1639
01:13:58,045 --> 01:13:59,288


1640
01:13:59,288 --> 01:14:02,997
- What do you mean, "finished"?
- I mean, I'm done with it all.

1641
01:14:02,997 --> 01:14:03,888


1642
01:14:03,888 --> 01:14:07,119
- I don't need to do this anymore.
- Jack, we had a deal.

1643
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:07,208


1644
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:10,838
- Well, I know we did, but...
- What about my cattle ranch?

1645
01:14:10,838 --> 01:14:12,568


1646
01:14:12,568 --> 01:14:16,038
How much do you think a ranch
would cost in South America?

1647
01:14:16,038 --> 01:14:17,368


1648
01:14:17,368 --> 01:14:21,407
- I don't wanna lose my brother.
- We'll take him with us.

1649
01:14:21,407 --> 01:14:41,768


1650
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:45,363
- Those son of a bitches! Come on!
- Jack, wait! Let's do this smart.

1651
01:14:45,363 --> 01:14:45,448


1652
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:47,485
Come on.

1653
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:57,728


1654
01:14:57,728 --> 01:14:59,002
I'm gonna marry that girl.

1655
01:14:59,002 --> 01:14:59,088


1656
01:14:59,088 --> 01:15:03,525
But she's, hell, around 360 pounds.
She's a big damn woman.

1657
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:03,768


1658
01:15:03,768 --> 01:15:05,566
Here, give me a sip.

1659
01:15:05,566 --> 01:15:17,528


1660
01:15:17,528 --> 01:15:19,166
You better start talking, son...

1661
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:19,248


1662
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:23,207
Or I'll turn the both of them loose on you.
Now, where are they?

1663
01:15:23,207 --> 01:16:03,648


1664
01:16:03,648 --> 01:16:05,241
Cover the window.

1665
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,528


1666
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,919
We ain't got much ammunition.
They'll blow this place apart!

1667
01:16:09,919 --> 01:16:10,008


1668
01:16:10,008 --> 01:16:11,726
I'm all right.

1669
01:16:11,726 --> 01:16:32,208


1670
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,040
They got a guy in the barn.

1671
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:34,128


1672
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:37,644
I'm going to the barn now. Okay?
I'll be right back.

1673
01:16:37,644 --> 01:16:37,728


1674
01:16:37,728 --> 01:16:38,843
All right.

1675
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:40,568


1676
01:16:40,568 --> 01:16:43,128
Jack, let me go.
I can shoot better than you.

1677
01:16:43,128 --> 01:16:43,288


1678
01:16:43,288 --> 01:16:45,598
That's why you're gonna cover me.

1679
01:16:45,598 --> 01:16:45,888


1680
01:16:45,888 --> 01:16:47,162
Bar this door.

1681
01:16:47,162 --> 01:17:29,848


1682
01:17:29,848 --> 01:17:33,887
- Lay still or you'll kill yourself.
- Why give those guys the pleasure?

1683
01:17:33,887 --> 01:17:38,608


1684
01:17:38,608 --> 01:17:40,804
Scattergood won't do shit at this distance.

1685
01:17:40,804 --> 01:17:40,888


1686
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:42,003
Deer slug.

1687
01:17:42,003 --> 01:17:42,848


1688
01:17:42,848 --> 01:17:44,600
That's a different story.

1689
01:17:44,600 --> 01:18:22,568


1690
01:18:22,568 --> 01:18:25,845
Clyde! Red! Get over in the barn!
We'll finish her!

1691
01:18:25,845 --> 01:19:11,488


1692
01:19:11,488 --> 01:19:14,128
Marvin, go and chuck this thing
on the porch.

1693
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:14,208


1694
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:17,007
- We'll burn them out like rats.
- You burn it yourself.

1695
01:19:17,007 --> 01:19:17,088


1696
01:19:17,088 --> 01:19:18,362
I ain't going out there.

1697
01:19:18,362 --> 01:19:18,448


1698
01:19:18,448 --> 01:19:20,758
I sure as hell ain't letting you cover me.
Now do it.

1699
01:19:20,758 --> 01:19:20,848


1700
01:19:20,848 --> 01:19:21,918
I ain't gonna.

1701
01:19:21,918 --> 01:19:22,008


1702
01:19:22,008 --> 01:19:24,079
Then die where you stand, mister.

1703
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,128


1704
01:19:28,128 --> 01:19:29,323
Now.

1705
01:19:29,323 --> 01:20:00,248


1706
01:20:00,248 --> 01:20:01,397
Good God.

1707
01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:23,648


1708
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:24,763
Walter!

1709
01:20:24,763 --> 01:20:26,888


1710
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:28,117
<i>Sarah!</i>

1711
01:20:28,117 --> 01:21:17,008


1712
01:21:17,008 --> 01:21:18,203
Jack.

1713
01:21:18,203 --> 01:21:18,528


1714
01:21:18,528 --> 01:21:20,405
Walter. We got to...

1715
01:21:20,405 --> 01:21:21,968


1716
01:21:21,968 --> 01:21:23,402
It's all right.

1717
01:21:23,402 --> 01:21:28,488


1718
01:21:28,488 --> 01:21:31,241
Jack. God!

1719
01:21:31,241 --> 01:22:07,808


1720
01:22:07,808 --> 01:22:09,287
You go on.

1721
01:22:09,287 --> 01:22:11,168


1722
01:22:11,168 --> 01:22:12,238
Go on.

1723
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:14,408


1724
01:22:14,408 --> 01:22:15,398
Go!

1725
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:45,408


1726
01:22:45,408 --> 01:22:47,877
You want me? Come on!

1727
01:22:47,877 --> 01:23:09,608


1728
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:12,487
I told you she was gonna get you killed.

1729
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,128


1730
01:23:14,128 --> 01:23:16,438
You should've stayed back East, thief.

1731
01:23:16,438 --> 01:23:17,568


1732
01:23:17,568 --> 01:23:20,686
Could be playing cards right now
in a warm bar...

1733
01:23:20,686 --> 01:23:21,208


1734
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:23,563
Instead of dying in this shithole.

1735
01:23:23,563 --> 01:23:27,368


1736
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:28,642
Go to hell.

1737
01:23:28,642 --> 01:23:36,128


1738
01:23:36,128 --> 01:23:38,119
Lay down and die, boy.

1739
01:23:38,119 --> 01:23:42,008


1740
01:23:42,008 --> 01:23:43,362
You earned it.

1741
01:23:43,362 --> 01:23:45,648


1742
01:23:45,648 --> 01:23:47,525
Speakes, leave him be!

1743
01:23:47,525 --> 01:23:54,728


1744
01:23:54,728 --> 01:23:56,480
I'm the one you want.

1745
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:03,768


1746
01:24:03,768 --> 01:24:05,600
Say 900d night, girl.

1747
01:24:05,600 --> 01:29:17,128


1748
01:29:17,128 --> 01:29:20,194
English
