1
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,216
Hilario.

2
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,016
Papa!

3
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,576
Sotero! My good friend.

4
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,895
How are ya?

5
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,130
You have a drink?

6
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,656
I can't tell you what a pleasure
it is to see a village like this.

7
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,290
Santos!

8
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,218
So much restlessness
and change in the outside world.

9
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,332
People no longer content
with their station in life.

10
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,179
Women's fashions? Shameless.

11
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,771
Cigar.

12
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,777
<i>¡Mire!</i> Religion!

13
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,859
You'd weep if you saw how true religion
is now a thing of the past.

14
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,492
Last month we were in San Juan -
a rich town. Sit down.

15
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,408
Rich town, much blessed by God.

16
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,895
Big church.

17
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,810
Not like here - little church,
priest comes twice a year. Big one!

18
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,649
You think we find gold candlesticks,
poor box filled to overflowing?

19
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,611
You know what we found?

20
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,937
Brass candlesticks,
almost nothing in the poor box.

21
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,774
But we took it anyway.

22
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,858
I know we took it anyway.

23
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,859
I'm trying to show him how little religion
some people now have.

24
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,210
That I could see for myself.

25
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,656
Don't see!

26
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,776
What if you had to carry my load, huh?

27
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,893
The need to provide food, like a father,
to fill the mouths of his hungry men.

28
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,976
Guns. Ammunition.

29
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,969
You know how much money
that costs? Huh? Huh?

30
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,613
No.

31
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,856
The days of good hunting are over.

32
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,770
Once there was horses, cattle,
gold, fruit from the trees. No more.

33
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,491
Now I must hunt with a price
on my head, <i>rurales</i> at my heels.

34
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,456
I'll be back.

35
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,616
Enough!

36
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,900
We'll get the rest when we come back.

37
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,815
I love this village.

38
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,939
- I know you have your problems...
- Murderer! Thief!

39
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,776
<i>(gunshots)</i>

40
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,576
Rafael!

41
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,538
Rafael!

42
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,854
Rafael...

43
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,096
<i>(sobs)</i> Rafael!

44
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,376
Stupid!

45
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,816
Stupid!

46
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,572
We have to have
another discussion very soon.

47
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,739
It's always a pleasure to hear
the views of my good friend Sotero.

48
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,534
Maybe when I come back, hm?

49
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,695
¡Adiós!

50
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,776
Let's go!

51
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,336
Help me bring him in.

52
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,010
If he steals our harvest again,...

53
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,576
..we might as well
cut our throats and be done with it!

54
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,134
Leave the valley. That's what we must do.

55
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,209
- Live somewhere else?
- Take our homes with us? Our farms?

56
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,848
We... could hide some food.

57
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,773
From Calvera?
He never steals <i>all</i> our food.

58
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,257
- He leaves us enough to go on with.
- That's something.

59
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,336
We could beg him to leave us more.

60
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,658
No, no. That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.

61
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,453
We <i>must</i> do something!

62
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,174
Like Rafael? Talk sense.

63
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,770
We break our backs in the fields,
and our bellies stay empty.

64
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,529
- We must do something!
- We <i>must</i> do something.

65
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,771
But what?

66
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,856
I don't know.

67
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,255
We'll ask the old man.

68
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,450
He'll know.

69
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,492
Fight.

70
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,134
You must fight. Fight!

71
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,215
With machetes and bare hands
against guns?

72
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,729
- Buy guns.
- Buy?

73
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,614
Go to the border. Guns are plentiful there.

74
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,732
But what are we going to use for money?

75
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,817
Sell that.

76
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,500
And anything else you can collect.

77
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,571
Even if we had the guns,...

78
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,296
..we know how to plant and grow -
we don't know how to kill.

79
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,695
Then learn.

80
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,776
Or die.

81
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,733
Hey! I've been waitin' for you.

82
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, you did a wonderful job.

83
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,737
- I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
- What?

84
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,058
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as
ready as the embalmer can make him,...

85
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,536
- ..but there'll be no funeral.
- Didn't I pay you enough?

86
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,211
It's not a question of money. For $20, I'd
plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.

87
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,139
But the funeral's off.

88
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,216
Well, how d'ya like that?

89
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,618
I want him buried. You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.

90
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,211
- That's as unanimous as you can get.
- You've behaved like a Christian, but...

91
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,808
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.

92
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,210
I'm a travelling salesman - ladies' corsets.

93
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,854
I'm walking down the street
and a man drops dead.

94
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,450
For two hours people stepped over him,
without lifting a finger.

95
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,611
I'm doing what any decent man would.

96
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,413
- Come on, Henry...
- No! This man has to be buried.

97
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,579
- Soon. He's not turning into a nosegay.
- I know. I would if I could, but...

98
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,097
- ..there's an element in town that objects.
- Objects? To what?

99
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,293
- They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
- What? In Boot Hill?

100
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,856
There's nothing there but murderers,
cutthroats and barflies.

101
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,778
And if they ever felt exclusive,
they're past it now.

102
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,460
They happen to be white, friend.

103
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,536
And old Sam...

104
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,049
Well, old Sam was an lndian.

105
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,215
Well, I'll be damned!

106
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,015
I never knew you had to be anything
but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.

107
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,099
- How long's this been going on?
- Since the town got civilised.

108
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,688
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it. No, sir.

109
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,017
I've always treated every man
as another future customer.

110
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,416
- In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
- My driver's quit.

111
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,499
- He's prejudiced too, huh?
- If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.

112
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,135
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody else will drive it! So here.

113
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,333
Oh, hell! If that's all that's
holding things up, I'll drive the rig.

114
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,488
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?

115
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,815
You're more than welcome.

116
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,253
Hey! Wait a minute there. This hearse cost
me $840. It's the only one in the county.

117
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,168
- I'll be darned if I let it be shot at.
- I'll pay for the damages.

118
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,258
- I wanna see this.
- Me, too!

119
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,779
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.

120
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,454
Let her buck.

121
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,570
- New in town?
- Yeah.

122
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,931
- Where are you from?
- Dodge. You?

123
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,573
- Tombstone. See any action up there?
- Uh-uh.

124
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,534
- Tombstone?
- Same. People all settled down, like.

125
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,015
- Same all over.
<i>- (man)</i> Injun lovers!

126
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,700
Easy. Just wind.

127
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,133
- We'll get there.
- It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.

128
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,615
It's stayin' up there that I mind.

129
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,136
Comin' up behind us on the left.

130
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,130
I don't think so.

131
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,730
Second-storey window. Curtain moved.

132
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,057
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

133
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,935
- You elected?
- No.

134
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,415
I got nominated real good.

135
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,252
Boys, why don't you just turn around
now - save yourselves a lot of trouble?

136
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,133
Soon, huh?

137
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,418
The reception committee is forming.

138
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,933
Hold it.

139
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,255
Hold it right there.

140
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,816
Anything wrong?

141
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,491
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

142
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,769
I need six men up here.

143
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,933
Yahoo!

144
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,572
- Boys, the drinks are on me!
<i>- (cheering)</i>

145
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,491
Hey! Hey!

146
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,612
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.

147
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,497
Thanks.

148
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,770
Where are you from?

149
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,135
Oh, yeah. Where are you goin'?

150
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,416
- Thanks for the free show.
- You're more than welcome.

151
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,853
Boy, that was really something.
I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.

152
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,778
- Henry, the stage is leavin'!
- All right, all right!

153
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,212
Wait till Flora hears about this.
Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.

154
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,570
Henry! The stage! Come on!

155
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,650
You keep this.

156
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:44,251
- Where <i>are</i> you headed?
- I'm drifting south, more or less.

157
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,132
You?

158
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,057
Just driftin'.

159
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,533
- Any action here?
- Yeah.

160
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,176
Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those
bars across the street, if that's your taste.

161
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,939
- Ah.
- Yeah.

162
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,016
Well... see ya.

163
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,775
Say, uh... what's your name?

164
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,256
Make it Vin.

165
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,814
- What's yours?
- Chris.

166
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,856
<i>(knock at door)</i>

167
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,855
Yes?

168
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,819
We think you are a man we can trust.

169
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,775
- Thank you very much.
- We wish you to help us.

170
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,097
- There's this man, Calvera.
- A thief. A murderer.

171
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,849
He and his men, they steal our food,
and then they leave us to starve.

172
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,256
- Not only that, but our women...
- Wait, wait. Just a minute.

173
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,259
- If you need protection, go to the <i>rurales.</i>
- We did. Twice.

174
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,255
But they can't station men in a small
village for... who knows how long?

175
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,495
So they left.

176
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,579
And when they left, he came again -
Calvera - and every year since.

177
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,453
He will do so until he is stopped.

178
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,971
Sit down.

179
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,019
- We need help.
- We must buy guns.

180
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,973
We know nothing about them.

181
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,330
Will you buy guns for us?

182
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,418
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.

183
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,980
- Why don't you hire men?
- Men?

184
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,570
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.

185
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,409
- Will you go?
- It will be a blessing if you help us.

186
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,814
- Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
- No, no. We offer more than that.

187
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,773
- We could feed you every day.
- And we have this.

188
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,856
What's that?

189
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,938
We can sell this for gold.

190
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,016
Everything we own.

191
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,256
Everything of value in the village.

192
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,771
I've been offered a lot for my work,
but never everything.

193
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,891
Will it be enough?

194
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,649
You see,
if we could drive the bandits away,...

195
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,374
..life could be very good in our village.

196
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,051
But as it is, we ourselves
could stand it a little longer,...

197
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,411
..but the children,
they cry because they're hungry.

198
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,175
Do you understand what it means
when you start something like this?

199
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,450
We will fight, too. Every one of us.

200
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,458
When Calvera comes,
the church bell will ring the alarm.

201
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,048
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.

202
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,809
If we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

203
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,217
Once you begin,...

204
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,298
..you have to be prepared
for killing and more killing.

205
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,093
And still more killing -
until the reason for it has gone.

206
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,098
- We understand.
- We've considered that.

207
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,939
Does every man in the village
feel the same?

208
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,016
Every man.

209
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,813
- I'll see what I can do for you.
<i>- Gracias.</i> You know...

210
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,090
Now, wait. I didn't say <i>I'll</i> go.

211
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,733
I'll pass the word around
that you're looking for men.

212
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,092
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.

213
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,090
Sure - same as they wear pants.
That's expected.

214
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,451
But good men?
That's something else again.

215
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,935
How can you tell they are good?

216
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,656
There are ways.

217
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,176
<i>(knocking)</i>

218
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,255
Come in.

219
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,490
The word is out you're looking for men.

220
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,214
That's right. Men who are good with that.

221
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,298
- I'm good with it.
- Fast?

222
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,178
- Try me.
- I aim to. Step in closer.

223
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,180
Now, hold your hands like that.

224
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,176
Now, clap.

225
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,858
Faster.

226
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,130
Now, as fast as you can.

227
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,570
Now you try it.

228
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,339
Very young and... and very proud.

229
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,330
The graveyards are full of boys
who were very young and very proud.

230
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,136
<i>(knocking)</i>

231
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,216
Come in.

232
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,338
- No tricks now, Chris.
- Harry! It's good to see you again.

233
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,769
- Chris.
- What are you doing in this dump?

234
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,256
- I heard you've got a contract open.
- Not for a high-stepper like you.

235
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,372
A dollar bill always looks
as big to me as a bedspread.

236
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,979
It's just eating money.

237
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,298
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.

238
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,652
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good,
but you always know what's goin' on.

239
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,736
Oh, Harry.

240
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,010
With your permission.

241
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,649
All right. All that's on top.
What's underneath?

242
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,534
- Only what I told you.
- Gold? Cattle? Payroll?

243
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,448
- Only what I told you.
- Sure, never mind. Tell me when you can.

244
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,538
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!

245
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,128
I said never mind. I'm in.

246
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,216
You dirty dog!

247
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,216
Place your bets.

248
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,656
Five.

249
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,656
Five.

250
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,810
Eight.

251
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,775
Eights again. Ten at the point.

252
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,092
The cowpoke that just walked in
in the stovepipe chaps,...

253
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,371
- ..I'd like to buy him a drink.
- Yes, sir!

254
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,209
<i>Válgame Dios.</i> There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.

255
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,377
The man for us
is the one who gave him that face.

256
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,809
Hey... you learn fast.

257
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,330
Next bet comin' up.

258
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,376
Crap.

259
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,330
Next man.

260
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,778
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.

261
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,290
- Vin.
- Howdy.

262
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,015
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Whisky.

263
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,370
Have you anything lined up?

264
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,129
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job
in a grocery store.

265
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,889
Fella says I'm gonna
make a crackerjack clerk.

266
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,772
Crackerjack.

267
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,050
If that's your taste...

268
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,533
I heard of a job shooin' some flies away
from a village, but I don't know the pay.

269
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,537
$20.

270
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,379
- A week?
- Six weeks: the whole job.

271
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,616
Well, that's ridiculous.

272
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,173
- You heard of anything?
- Yeah.

273
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,497
Shooing some flies away
from a little village.

274
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,936
Their village.

275
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,376
It pays $20?

276
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,689
I'm looking for men right now.

277
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,809
- No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
- Ours is a poor village.

278
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,012
We understand. You could get
much more in a grocery store,...

279
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,096
..and it's good, steady work.

280
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,776
Yep.

281
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,735
How many you got?

282
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,531
Looking for O'Reilly.

283
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,688
Don't know his name, but there's a fella
in back choppin' wood for his breakfast.

284
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,376
Mornin'.

285
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,696
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.

286
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,776
He tells me you're broke.

287
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,336
Nah, I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire(!)

288
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,215
There's a job for six men, watching over
a village, south of the border.

289
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,488
How big's the opposition?

290
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,770
Thirty guns.

291
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,416
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

292
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,816
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County war.

293
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,489
Well, they paid me $600 for that one.

294
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,134
He said you got that Salinas thing
cleared up.

295
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,899
They paid me $800 for that one.

296
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,410
- You cost a lot.
- Yeah...

297
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,974
That's right, I cost a lot.

298
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,088
The offer is $20.

299
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,096
$20?

300
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,968
Right now, that's a lot.

301
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,376
- Where can I reach you?
- Right here.

302
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,660
- I still say he can't.
- And I tell you he can.

303
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,090
- If he claims that, he's a liar.
- Not so loud. He might hear you.

304
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,859
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.

305
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,858
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.

306
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,414
- Well, you ain't bettin' with me.
- Me either.

307
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,531
I told you what he said, and I believe him.

308
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,857
- Well, one of us is a fathead.
- You can get good odds on which.

309
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,369
Ha! Ha! Ha!

310
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,570
Britt. Britt, wake up.

311
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,729
I'm talkin' to ya! Look at me!

312
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,611
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong. What d'you say?

313
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,576
Ha! Ha! Ha!

314
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,779
What's the matter? You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?

315
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,096
Call it.

316
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,570
Well, you see, I won.

317
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,770
Well, how about it?

318
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,256
Well?

319
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,058
- Filene, how about it?
- I don't know. It was mighty close.

320
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,856
Close? What d'you mean, close? You all
got eyes. You saw what happened. I won!

321
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,131
You tell 'em. I won, didn't l?

322
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,216
You lost.

323
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,175
You're a liar.

324
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,770
I said you're a liar!

325
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,495
I said you're a coward and a liar!

326
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,098
Get up. Let's do it for real.

327
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,739
Get up!

328
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,328
Get up, I said!

329
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,169
So help me, I'll let you have it
right where you are.

330
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,856
- Call it!
- I want nothin' to do with this.

331
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,936
- Call it!
- Drop it, Wallace. Forget it.

332
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,699
Get away from me.

333
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,256
Call it.

334
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,091
- Britt.
- Chris.

335
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,934
Can I have a word with you?

336
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,090
Did you have any luck?

337
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,257
Found a man
who would have been perfect.

338
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,851
Gun or knife, you couldn't
want any better. Wasn't interested.

339
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,096
The money? It wasn't enough?

340
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,650
He doesn't care a hoot about money.

341
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,056
A man in this line of work
who doesn't care about money?

342
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,856
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.

343
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,256
Others, for reasons of their own,
enjoy only the danger.

344
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,177
And the competition.

345
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,896
If he's the best with a knife and a gun,
with whom does he compete?

346
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,578
Himself.

347
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,850
<i>(doors swing open)</i>

348
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,776
You.

349
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,370
- I've been looking for you!
- Uh-oh! What have we got here?

350
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,218
Never mind.

351
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,296
He knows.

352
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,092
Clap hands, he says.

353
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,735
Clap your hands,
and let's see how fast you are.

354
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,536
Clap hands!

355
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,338
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him,...

356
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,018
..cos he'd be proud to work with him.

357
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,173
He makes me look like two cents
with some damned kids' game!

358
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,373
- Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
- You stay away from me, will ya?

359
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,490
Come on, now,...

360
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,009
..and let's see how fast you are.

361
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,019
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!

362
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,657
Just draw.

363
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,214
Come on. Come on, draw!

364
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,616
<i>- Campesino.</i> Come on!
- You say <i>campesino</i> to me?

365
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,532
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!

366
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,300
You don't think I mean it, huh?

367
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,335
You... think I'm just talking, huh?

368
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,330
Hey... get up.

369
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,335
Do you hear me?

370
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,975
Get up and face me!

371
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,136
Do you hear?

372
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,856
Hey,...

373
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,935
..give him my gun, huh?

374
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,974
Sorry this happened, friend.

375
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,409
Let him sleep it off.

376
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,249
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

377
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,053
And give him a drink.

378
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,338
I changed my mind.

379
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,017
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.

380
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,570
Remember me?

381
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,536
Yep.

382
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,730
You need men to do a job in Mexico.

383
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,851
- That's right.
- How long?

384
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,572
Four, six weeks.

385
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,249
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?

386
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,130
I thought you were looking
for the Johnson brothers.

387
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,490
I found them.

388
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,329
- How much does the job pay?
- 20. We leave tomorrow.

389
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,853
I'll have the money before I leave.

390
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,892
lt'll just take care of
my last two days' rent.

391
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,490
$20? You must be livin' in style.

392
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,053
Yes.

393
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,810
I have the most stylish corner
of the filthy storeroom out back.

394
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,056
That, and one plate of beans:

395
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,492
$10 a day.

396
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,937
Yeah, things do get high when
they find out you're on the run.

397
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,620
There's a dry wash south of town.

398
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,490
Pick me up there.

399
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,648
He's a good gun.

400
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,054
And we aren't heading for a church social.

401
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,336
Chris.

402
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,133
Yeah. He picked us up at dawn.

403
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,376
- Any idea who it is?
- Yeah. That kid from the saloon.

404
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,698
- Won't take no for an answer.
- Doesn't show much sense, does he?

405
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,852
I'm getting a stiff neck
keepin' track of him.

406
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,972
If you can't forget him,
why don't you ride side-saddle?

407
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,819
Ah, well... he won't last much longer.

408
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,090
That so?

409
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,854
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat -
what a chucklehead!

410
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,175
Yeah. Not smart like us(!)

411
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,976
Yep.

412
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,498
Suppose our friend over there
has got anything to eat?

413
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,135
- How about I bring him some?
- Ah, it isn't food he's hungry for.

414
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,378
Then let me tie a can to his tail.
Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.

415
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,572
Ah, leave him alone. It's a free country.

416
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,656
And it's his.

417
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,334
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.

418
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,255
Where is everybody?

419
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,299
- Where are they, Tomas?
- Luis! Asunción! Demetrio!

420
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,730
Emilio! Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?

421
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,536
<i>(Hilario)</i> Come out! Come out and make
them welcome, before we die of shame.

422
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,969
Hilario, stop your shouting.

423
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,211
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?

424
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,615
Come in. You must be thirsty.

425
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,212
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.

426
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,695
They are afraid of everyone
and everything.

427
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,334
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...

428
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,288
The summer may be too hot,
the winter - too cold.

429
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,890
The sow has no pigs,
the farmer is afraid he may starve.

430
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,978
She has too many,
he's afraid <i>she</i> may starve.

431
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,337
There's no need to apologise.
We didn't expect flowers and speeches.

432
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,169
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the founding of the village.

433
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,259
They will be celebrating -
then, you will see them in a better light.

434
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,336
<i>( bell ringing)</i>

435
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,528
Who sounded the alarm?

436
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,174
Who sounded the alarm?

437
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,889
I did.

438
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,816
Thank you, amigos,
for coming out to greet us.

439
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,534
Thank you for letting us see
your beautiful faces(!)

440
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,493
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!

441
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,740
You come running out like chickens!

442
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,654
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.

443
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,572
And you?

444
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,816
You hide from us!

445
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,772
Hide... from us!

446
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,529
Ah... but it's a different story
when you're in danger, huh?

447
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,248
You might lose your precious crops.

448
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,814
Then you flock to us. Huh?

449
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,730
Well... we're here, my compadres and l.

450
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,299
And here we stay.

451
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,931
And you?

452
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,258
You prove to us
that you're worth fighting for.

453
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,089
Now get back to your houses,
back to work. Go on! Go back.

454
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,691
We'll let you know when to fight and how
to fight. Go back! All of you, go back!

455
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,651
Go back!

456
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,616
Now we're seven.

457
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,256
<i>(drum beats)</i>

458
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,973
You know, I've been in some towns
where the girls aren't very pretty.

459
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,093
As a matter of fact, I've been in some
towns where they were downright ugly.

460
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,610
But this is the first time I've been
in a town where there's no girls at all.

461
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,731
Except little ones.

462
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,409
If we're not careful,
we can have quite a social life here(!)

463
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,897
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast
crowd that hangs out near the fountain.

464
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:38,172
We got to predictin' the weather for today
and didn't break up till twilight.

465
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:49,570
Stop the music! Bring out the other bull!

466
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,656
<i>(cheering)</i>

467
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,096
<i>(firecrackers  bang)</i>

468
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,696
<i>(high-pitched note)</i>

469
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,775
Hilario!

470
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,856
<i>(whispering)</i>

471
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,216
Britt.

472
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,531
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.

473
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,696
<i>(Britt)</i> Lee.

474
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,778
- Get one alive.
- Yes.

475
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,136
I'll show you where.

476
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,898
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.

477
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,056
<i>(festivities continue)</i>

478
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,256
<i>(whispers)</i>

479
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,253
- I'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
- Shut up!

480
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,331
Oh... That... that was
the greatest shot I've ever seen.

481
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,371
The worst.

482
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,775
I was aiming at the horse.

483
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,732
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.

484
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,533
It's almost certain they saw us.

485
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,249
Whatever they learned
will be buried with them.

486
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,496
<i>¡Válgame Dios!</i> If he comes now...

487
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,291
He'd never send men ahead
if he was near enough to see for himself.

488
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:31,050
So we have time to get ready.
And we have something else - surprise.

489
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,216
If he rides in with no idea of
the reception we can prepare for him,...

490
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,935
..I promise you, we'll all teach him
something about the price of corn.

491
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,651
Aim,...

492
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,930
..squeeze,...

493
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,858
..cock.

494
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,698
Aim,...

495
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,776
..squeeze,...

496
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,734
..cock.

497
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,774
Settle down. Now, you miss the first
chance, you may not get a second.

498
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,293
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.

499
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,856
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.

500
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:14,213
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.

501
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,975
Fire.

502
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,897
That rock?

503
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,215
No, that man you're gonna kill.

504
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,697
Good!

505
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,288
If only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

506
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,980
- You'll get more guns.
- How?

507
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,137
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.

508
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,649
The ones who spied on us brought them.

509
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,055
Like three kings bearing gifts.

510
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,615
If Calvera does not come now,
after all of this,...

511
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,810
..what a waste!

512
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,215
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?

513
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,218
Señor, not a fox. A coyote!

514
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,252
How did he ever find out
about the gold mine?

515
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,336
Gold mine?

516
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,570
- What gold mine, señor?
- You know, the one in the mountains.

517
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,932
- In our mountains?
- We never had a gold mine around here.

518
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,575
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

519
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,409
- Whatever happened to it?
- We have no silver mine either.

520
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:35,328
- I mean in the old days.
- Not at any time.

521
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,850
Where did you hear
of this gold and silver, hm?

522
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,610
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?

523
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,296
<i>Toro.</i>

524
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,812
<i>Toro.</i>

525
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,010
<i>¡ Toro!</i>

526
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,695
Come on, little bull!

527
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,896
<i>Toro.</i>

528
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,456
<i>Toro.</i>

529
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,056
<i>(twig snaps)</i>

530
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,416
You do anything to me
and I'll kill you while you are doing it.

531
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,056
- You almost took my eye out!
- Let me go. Let me go!

532
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,899
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!

533
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,970
I got a good mind
to throw you in the water.

534
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,614
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!

535
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,890
Shut up. Shut up!

536
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,619
- Where are the others? Huh?
- I'll never tell you.

537
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,215
Look what I found.

538
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,371
- Who is she?
- From our village.

539
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,252
So that's where they were. You hid them.

540
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,940
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.

541
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,370
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.

542
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,095
Farmers! Their families
told them we'd rape them.

543
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,215
Well, we might.

544
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,572
In my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

545
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,134
But... just as you please.

546
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,735
As long as you were out there,
why didn't you bring 'em all in?

547
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,328
What for? Leave them out there.

548
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,928
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.

549
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,175
Bring them in.

550
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,256
Show him the way.

551
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,336
Ma'am.

552
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,693
Come on, little angel(!)

553
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,336
Gently, boy.

554
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,136
Gently.

555
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:53,173
I can't tell you how wonderful it was
for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.

556
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,852
- How's the food?
- Great.

557
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:11,450
Chicken enchiladas, <i>carne asada</i>
and Spanish rice. Looks good.

558
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,811
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.

559
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,330
Do you know what the villagers
have been eating since we got here?

560
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,179
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.

561
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,809
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

562
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,574
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

563
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,737
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

564
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,851
Do you have an older,
grateful sister at home?

565
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,495
- No, sir. Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

566
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,973
Many thanks.

567
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,939
One, two, three, four.

568
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,053
One, two, three, four.

569
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:48,019
One, two, three, four.

570
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,138
One, two, three, four.

571
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:54,338
One, two, three, four.

572
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,779
One, two,...

573
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,174
..three, four.

574
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,053
One, two, three, four.

575
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,416
Squeeze.

576
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,371
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze? Hm?

577
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,855
Just like when
you're milking a goat, Miguel.

578
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,256
- It's that I get excited.
- Well, don't get excited!

579
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:16,728
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.

580
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,055
All right... squeeze.

581
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,692
Squeeze!

582
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:28,335
I'll tell you what. Don't shoot the gun.

583
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:32,089
You take the gun like this
and you use it like a club. All right?

584
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,175
Right.

585
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,256
Flaco!

586
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,936
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

587
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,659
Good afternoon.

588
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,008
Howdy.

589
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,734
We've come to move you into the village.

590
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:14,694
- Move into the village? Me?
- Everybody who lives outside.

591
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,652
Oh, no.

592
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,736
We can't protect you out here.

593
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,454
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.

594
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,493
Rojas? His conversation
would bore me to death!

595
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,016
Yeah, well, uh...

596
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,973
- ..maybe somebody else, huh?
- They are all farmers.

597
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,809
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertiliser and women.

598
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,694
I've never shared
their enthusiasm for fertiliser.

599
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:45,530
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.

600
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:48,530
I am staying here.

601
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,891
Yeah, well, uh... what are you
gonna do when Calvera comes?

602
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,853
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.

603
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,890
Don't worry. Why would he kill me?

604
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,019
Bullets cost money.

605
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,132
All right. Have it your way.

606
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,816
You worry about yourself.

607
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,010
Are you ready for him?

608
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,256
What if he comes now, eh?

609
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:17,099
It's like that fella
who fell off a ten-storey building.

610
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,972
What about him?

611
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:23,093
As he was falling, people on each floor
heard him say "So far, so good."

612
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,370
So far, so good!

613
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,379
First of all, they'll see that ditch.

614
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,650
More water for the corn.

615
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:04,172
- Awful lot of new walls.
- Civic improvements.

616
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,496
Hey, Chris,...

617
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,895
..what about that net, eh?

618
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,580
Well, if he's not looking for it...

619
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,895
If he rides in unsuspecting.

620
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,696
If, brother!

621
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,776
If!

622
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,177
Yeah.

623
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,256
Yeah!

624
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:58,050
I should have guessed. When my men
didn't come back, I should have guessed.

625
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:02,171
- How many of you did they hire?
- Enough.

626
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,857
New wall!

627
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:12,289
There are lots of new walls. All around.

628
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,256
They won't keep me out.

629
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,974
They were built to keep you in.

630
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,220
Did you hear that? We're trapped!

631
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:37,251
All forty of us! By these three.

632
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,816
Or is it four? They couldn't afford
to hire more than that.

633
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,454
We come cheaper by the bunch.

634
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,218
Five!

635
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,934
Even five won't give us too much trouble.

636
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,213
There won't be any trouble -
if you ride on.

637
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,739
Ride on?

638
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:58,012
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?

639
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,256
Buy it or grow it.

640
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,655
Or maybe even work for it!

641
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,611
Seven!

642
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,897
Somehow, I don't think
you've solved my problem.

643
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,614
Solving your problems isn't our line.

644
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,970
We deal in lead, friend.

645
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,058
So do l. We're in the same business, huh?

646
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,654
- Only as competitors.
- Why not as partners?

647
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,736
Suppose I offer you equal shares?

648
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,216
- In what?
- Everything. To the last grain.

649
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,173
And the people in the village?
What about them?

650
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,056
I leave it to you.

651
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,570
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

652
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,419
May even be sacrilegious.

653
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:47,695
If God didn't want them sheared,
he would not have made them sheep.

654
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,732
- What do you say?
- Ride on.

655
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,495
You hear that, Sotero?

656
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,815
You hear what he said?

657
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:02,771
Ride on.

658
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,856
To me!

659
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,655
You tell him to ride on
before I become angry.

660
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,816
Him, and the others!

661
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:17,616
Because, if I leave with empty hands,...

662
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:22,211
..everybody in this village
will answer to me - when I come back!

663
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:25,491
- You won't come back.
- Why not?

664
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,856
You won't have any guns.

665
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,378
Take them off right now and drop them.

666
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:38,418
Generosity. That was my first mistake!

667
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:44,460
I leave these people a little bit extra
and they hire these men to make trouble.

668
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:49,290
It shows you... sooner or later,
you must answer for every good deed.

669
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,252
You were safe.

670
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:23,817
I was face to face with them as they
rode toward me. Ten of them, screaming.

671
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:27,535
- The last time you told it, it was five!
- They multiply like rabbits!

672
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,651
Ten. Ten!

673
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,898
Yeh-hey!

674
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,336
- They got a good kick in the behind.
- If they try it again, they'll get another!

675
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:43,817
- We'll tear them to pieces.
- We'll bury them all. Calvera too, huh?

676
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,297
Any sign of 'em?

677
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,730
- No.
- That is bad luck.

678
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:55,136
Can you imagine? I knew him
when he was a mouse!

679
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,298
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.

680
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:05,413
- I would never have guessed it.
- Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.

681
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,337
- You think so?
- Of course.

682
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:10,258
He'll go away. There are other villages -

683
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,940
other villages that don't sting
the way we do.

684
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:14,129
Señor!

685
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:25,057
Neighbours... I drink to our friends.

686
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:31,134
They armed us, fought at our sides,
and will forever live in our hearts.

687
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,455
<i>(gunshots)</i>

688
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,255
They haven't gone, then.

689
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:49,696
<i>(gunshots)</i>

690
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,698
- See the gun flashin'?
- No.

691
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:02,775
<i>(gunshot)</i>

692
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,858
- I make it two of them.
- Three.

693
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,376
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.

694
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,977
Chico! Stay put.

695
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,728
- Three?
- Three.

696
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:41,289
O'Reilly? Do you see them?

697
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:45,254
No... They're too far back in the trees.

698
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:47,378
- Chris.
- Yeah?

699
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,937
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.

700
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:58,695
<i>(Chris)</i> Chico... cover the back door.

701
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,856
Get back!

702
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:32,290
Get back! Go on!

703
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,809
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?

704
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:37,249
Get down. Now stay down!

705
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,451
Crazy kids! You might have been hurt.

706
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,777
- So might you.
- It's not the same thing.

707
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:50,131
- This is my work.
- It's our work, too.

708
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:53,696
Everyone tells us
"Hide! Get back! Stay out of sight!"

709
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:57,290
- But we're not afraid.
- He's very brave. It's the truth.

710
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,254
So is he. We all are -
every boy in the village.

711
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,890
We had a meeting
and we drew straws and we got you.

712
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,299
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?

713
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,775
If you get killed, we avenge you.

714
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:20,132
And we see to it that there's always
fresh flowers on your grave.

715
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,853
That's a mighty big comfort(!)

716
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:28,813
I told you he would appreciate that.

717
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:32,250
Don't you kids be too disappointed
if your plans don't work out.

718
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,258
We won't. If you stay alive,
we'll be just as happy.

719
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,450
Maybe even happier.

720
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,971
Maybe.

721
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,415
Can you see them?

722
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,496
No.

723
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,969
Do your, uh,...

724
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,660
..hands sweat before a fight?

725
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:21,575
- Every time.
- Mine are sweatin' now.

726
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,496
Funny...

727
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,934
Hands sweat,...

728
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,528
..mouth is dry.

729
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,811
You'd think it would be
the other way around.

730
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,856
Does my... talking annoy you?

731
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,694
Mm-mm.

732
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,416
It's because I'm...

733
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,810
..I'm frightened, you know?

734
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,774
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish
you'd given your crops to Calvera, huh?

735
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,856
Yes...

736
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,096
..and no.

737
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:03,130
Both at the same time.

738
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:06,731
Yes, when I think of,...

739
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,816
..of what he might do.

740
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:15,376
No, when I remember the feeling
in my chest this morning...

741
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,536
..as I saw him run away.

742
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,376
From us.

743
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,336
Man,...

744
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,934
..that's a feeling worth dying for!

745
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,537
Have you ever... felt something like that?

746
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,010
Not for a long, long time.

747
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,456
I, uh,...

748
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:40,016
..envy you.

749
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:53,093
- What are you doing here?
- You shouldn't do things like you did.

750
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,973
- Go back.
- You mustn't take foolish chances.

751
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,409
All right, I won't. But go back.

752
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:04,299
- Does it hurt?
- What?

753
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,932
No.

754
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,413
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...

755
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,890
- You know what I thought.
- Yes, yes. I know.

756
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:29,452
I wasn't afraid of you. It's my father.

757
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,855
He says "Stay away from those men."

758
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,209
"They are brutes. They are cruel."

759
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:39,173
He's right. Do you know that? He's right.

760
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,770
Well... go back home now.

761
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,418
He is wrong.

762
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,296
Well... go home anyway,...

763
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,615
..before he finds out you're here.

764
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,130
He already knows.

765
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:59,536
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

766
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:02,536
But I don't care.

767
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,013
They got them. They got them all!

768
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,495
- Result.
- Do you think they'll try that again?

769
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:24,136
I doubt it. For all they know,
we're still out there ready to jump them.

770
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,455
He didn't go. Calvera didn't go?

771
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,014
Did you think it would be that easy?

772
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,377
- What do we do now?
- Well, what do you say?

773
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,537
- Me?
- We work for you, you know.

774
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,740
What else is there to do but... wait?

775
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,655
- It's Calvera's move.
- Right.

776
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,692
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.

777
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,538
- If you were Calvera,...
- Yes?

778
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:52,529
..you'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.

779
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,855
- Yes, I would, only...
- Only what?

780
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,011
Only I'm not Calvera.

781
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,133
Take the rifles and the <i>bandoleras</i>
and pass 'em out.

782
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,569
Now, let's get out there on duty.

783
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:17,057
Food, woman.

784
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:19,136
They'll be hungry.

785
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,528
That was... that was the greatest...

786
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,049
New hat for you, sonny.

787
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,896
Hey!

788
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,611
- How do I look? Huh?
- Big improvement.

789
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,775
You know what? They'll make up a song
about you and this hat.

790
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:09,974
Villages like this make up a song about
every big thing. They sing them for years.

791
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,012
- Do you think it's worth it?
- Don't you?

792
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:18,089
It's only a matter of knowing how
to shoot a gun. Nothing big about that.

793
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:25,248
Hey... how can you talk like this?

794
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:30,372
Your gun has got you
everything you have. lsn't that true?

795
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:32,650
Mm?

796
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,090
- Well, isn't that true?
- Yeah, sure. Everything.

797
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:40,736
After a while you can call bartenders
by their first name. Maybe 200 of 'em.

798
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:44,933
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.

799
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,574
Home: none. Wife: none. Kids:

800
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:51,056
none.

801
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,216
Prospects: zero.

802
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,374
- Suppose I left anything out?
- Yeah.

803
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,014
Places you are tied down to: none.

804
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:04,095
People with a hold on you: none.

805
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,780
Men you step aside for: none.

806
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,050
Insults swallowed:

807
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,932
none.

808
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,210
Enemies: none.

809
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:19,020
No enemies?

810
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,054
Alive.

811
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:25,650
Well! This is the kind of arithmetic I like!

812
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:27,896
Yeah, so did I at your age.

813
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,614
Give these to someone
who knows how to use them.

814
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,935
Yeah.

815
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,972
Why don't you ask Calvera
what he has in mind for tonight?

816
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:39,297
Yes, do that. And I'll
write a song for you myself.

817
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,449
Andrés,
Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.

818
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,536
That's three.

819
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:54,773
- Armando in the plaza.
- That's four.

820
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,893
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where
they were caught by that cursed net.

821
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,169
Damn them!

822
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,655
Five and six.

823
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,738
Emilio going over the wall.

824
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,293
Seven.

825
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:10,695
José near the fountain.

826
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,098
Eight.

827
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,688
Gregorio near the fountain.

828
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,416
That's nine.

829
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,618
Nine.

830
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,810
Fortuno by the water ditch.

831
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:36,615
Rico in the fields,
where they slashed him to pieces!

832
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:39,937
That's... 10 and 11.

833
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:43,608
Go on.

834
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,458
Talk.

835
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,536
Talk! Talk!

836
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:53,291
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.

837
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,090
There's still plenty of us here...
to make them pay.

838
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,890
Our friends down below.

839
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,656
<i>(moaning)</i>

840
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,736
Please, no!

841
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,375
It's all right. You're all right.

842
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,333
You had a dream. Just a bad dream.

843
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:39,610
Have no fear.

844
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,056
"Have no fear"?

845
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,496
My very words.

846
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,496
10,000 times a day.

847
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,774
Señor, don't punish yourself.

848
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:59,212
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.

849
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:10,295
Until the day you lose your nerve.

850
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,856
You feel it.

851
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:17,136
And then you wait,...

852
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:21,411
..for the bullet in the gun
that is faster than yours.

853
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:25,328
- Señor, don't.
- And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.

854
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,529
No enemies:

855
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,616
alive.

856
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:36,698
I have lost count of my enemies.

857
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:41,010
- But you're with friends now.
- Yes.

858
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:43,779
The final, supreme idiocy:

859
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,250
comin' here to hide.

860
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:53,655
The deserter... hidin' out
in the middle of a battlefield.

861
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:12,416
One.

862
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:17,291
There was a time
when I woulda caught all three.

863
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:32,248
We know what fear is.

864
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:34,814
We live with it all our lives.

865
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,210
Only the dead are without fear.

866
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,656
Rico!

867
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,335
Rico!

868
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,690
One minute, Mother!

869
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,974
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep,
and then we'll be back on duty.

870
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:06,490
- All right, Bernardo?
- Yes, but not you, Juan.

871
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:08,770
You're too young. Come on.

872
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,656
Bernardo O'Reilly!

873
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,570
You've been adopted.

874
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,138
Yeah, it's my real name.

875
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:24,458
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other,
and me in the middle.

876
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:30,090
Now, watch carefully. Here we go.

877
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:34,619
See? All three, right side up.

878
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:37,971
- Think you can do it?
- Of course. That's very easy.

879
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,649
Would you, uh... care to make
a friendly wager? A little bet?

880
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:44,738
- You know we have no money.
- It doesn't have to be money.

881
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:48,978
Whatever you have hidden away,
buried out where Calvera can't find it.

882
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,499
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?

883
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:55,011
Yeah. They tell me a lotta precious stones
have been dug out of the mountains.

884
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,779
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.

885
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:01,370
- Oh, yes. Yes, that's very true.
- There's no denyin' it.

886
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,219
<i>(Harry)</i> Well, then!

887
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:09,652
No! When you're finished,
they should all be right side up.

888
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,930
Let me try it again, eh?

889
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,417
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?

890
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,100
<i>(Flaco)</i> As you say, señor,
in the mountains.

891
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:25,337
- Where in the mountains?
- That I couldn't tell you.

892
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:27,178
There! I got it!

893
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:30,258
Never mind that. Why can't you tell me?

894
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:32,940
Because I never have found
any precious stones.

895
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:38,777
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in
the hills, from when the Spaniards came?

896
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:42,051
That's exactly what I mean.
Aztec treasure. Have you found some?

897
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,253
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.

898
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,053
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.

899
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:52,570
Then tell me this - how come Calvera
keeps hangin' around here?

900
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:56,579
Calvera... We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.

901
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,770
No, he will not.

902
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:03,538
- He won't go anywhere.
- Why do you say that?

903
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,969
Calvera isn't worried
about food for winter.

904
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:10,730
He's worried about the food his men
haven't eaten for the last three days.

905
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:14,174
The price of corn is going up.

906
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:17,497
- They're starving.
- How do you know?

907
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:21,454
- Starving and broke.
- How do you know?

908
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,256
Oh...

909
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,216
I've been up there.

910
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:31,574
Well, we'd better be ready for them.

911
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:36,137
- Because they gotta die or win.
<i>- Válgame Dios</i> if they do win.

912
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:39,491
- They won't win.
- Are you God, that you can say for sure?

913
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,498
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered. What are we to do?

914
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,929
Keep on fighting.

915
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,210
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

916
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:49,808
That is not what you were hired for.

917
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,650
- Once you start, there's no stopping.
- You understood that, and I told him!

918
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:55,338
I don't care.

919
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:58,691
Go away. All of you.
Get on your horses and go.

920
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:01,288
- Let Calvera have the food.
- Give him what he wants.

921
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,617
- At least we'll be alive.
- Quiet! And listen to me!

922
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:07,095
No! It is easy for them to say fight.

923
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:10,530
They have no sons,
no daughters, no wives.

924
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:12,935
Go. Now, before it's too late.

925
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,650
Is that what you want?

926
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:23,653
Answer me!

927
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:28,690
Who's for going on and who's for
giving up? I want to know now.

928
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,015
Don't be fools! You'll turn our village
into a graveyard.

929
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:41,291
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.

930
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:43,530
I'll tell you what I can do.

931
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:47,414
I can kill the first man who so much
as whispers a word about giving up.

932
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:51,294
The very first man,
so help me, I'll blow his head off!

933
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:19,572
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!

934
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,736
With or without you.

935
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,016
I'm not sayin' we bit off
more than we can chew,...

936
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:41,132
..but we oughta talk about
what we're gonna do.

937
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,694
We start acting like
we had some good sense.

938
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:47,529
We figured to raise the ante just enough
to make Calvera play someplace else.

939
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:50,891
- We figured wrong.
- We're the only game in town.

940
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,375
- A man can't call 'em all.
- I didn't say he could.

941
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:57,652
All I'm saying is that sometimes
you bend with the breeze... or you break.

942
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,978
D'you wanna go?

943
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:07,333
There comes a time to get out. The village
will be no worse off than before we came.

944
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,736
You forget one thing. We took a contract.

945
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:14,648
- It's not the kind courts enforce.
- That's just the kind you've gotta keep.

946
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:18,056
A noble thought,
but the way things are right now,...

947
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:23,290
- ..l don't know.
- The odds are too high.

948
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:25,297
- Much too high.
- Then we go?

949
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:27,376
No.

950
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,130
We lower the odds.

951
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,535
Right up into the hills,...

952
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:35,616
..past the men on guard,...

953
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:37,776
..right into their camp.

954
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:44,537
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette
with them, we discussed a few things.

955
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,656
We... you know...

956
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:52,692
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

957
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:58,095
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news,...

958
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:02,657
..you should have seen the look I got
from Britt - and from Chris.

959
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:06,568
They have seen a thing or two
in their time, and done them too.

960
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:10,409
They're not men
you can impress easily. Oh, no.

961
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:14,658
But when they looked at me,
I knew I was one of them at last.

962
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,617
Well,...

963
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:24,334
..you'd better take a look at me, too.

964
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:28,373
Am I the kind of man
who'd live in a place like this? Hm?

965
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,734
Digging my life away out in the fields?

966
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,010
Me, a farmer - a peasant?

967
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,814
You know what I'm saying, huh?

968
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:42,535
Wherever they go -
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -

969
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,855
I go with them.

970
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:52,533
And if you think you, or anything you do,
could make me change my mind, forget it.

971
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:57,050
I want you to understand that.

972
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:01,380
I... want you to understand that...

973
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,456
..this...

974
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,568
..will get you nothing but this.

975
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:22,138
We're going to hit Calvera,...

976
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:25,218
..maybe drive off some of his horses.

977
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,808
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.

978
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,170
I'll go with you. I know every rock.

979
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,655
No, you stay. You're in charge here.

980
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,975
You can count on me.

981
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,736
I know I can.

982
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:36,099
- They've left to hit the village.
- No.

983
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:38,495
We'd have heard shots.

984
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:42,857
They've gone.

985
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,810
Good evening.

986
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:40,330
You'll be dead. All of you!

987
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,539
Like that!

988
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,969
If that's what you want.

989
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:47,330
Do we have a choice?

990
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:52,210
Of course.

991
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:54,171
Sit down.

992
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,256
Let's talk.

993
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:01,698
Things are turned around now, uh?

994
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:04,539
You're wondering how.

995
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:07,777
Your friends, they don't like you
very much any more.

996
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:10,414
You force them
to make too many decisions.

997
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,929
With me... only one decision.

998
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:15,051
Do what I say.

999
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:17,330
You should not be surprised.

1000
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:21,738
My good friend Sotero,
he arranged to let me come in.

1001
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,456
Understand?

1002
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,775
Well, anyway,...

1003
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,334
..to business!

1004
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,099
I could kill you all. You agree?

1005
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:48,375
Well... you don't disagree.

1006
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:54,256
- Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
- Why so generous?

1007
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:58,298
Practical. They hear about it up north.

1008
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:01,412
Maybe some friends of yours
make more trouble for me.

1009
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:04,293
A man who never wants no trouble.

1010
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,889
We have a saying here.

1011
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:12,138
A thief who steals from a thief
is pardoned for 100 years.

1012
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:16,139
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.

1013
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:20,657
- Ride on.
- Just like that?

1014
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,850
Mm, just like...

1015
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:27,053
I'll make it easy for you. You want food?

1016
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,772
Give them food.

1017
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,255
Water? All right. Water.

1018
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:34,213
Horses? Saddled and waiting.

1019
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:36,296
Guns?

1020
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:41,535
The guns... the gun belts,
you take off and put here now.

1021
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:50,220
What about these people?

1022
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:55,209
What happens to these people will
happen whether I kill you first or not.

1023
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,816
Just a little gesture, huh?

1024
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:09,415
To show these people
who the real boss is.

1025
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,498
You go, then I give you the guns back.

1026
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,173
I know you won't
use those guns against me.

1027
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:19,531
Only a crazy man
makes the same mistake twice.

1028
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:51,618
I don't understand why a man like you
took the job in the first place. Hm? Why?

1029
01:42:51,740 --> 01:42:56,052
- I wonder myself.
- No, come on. Come on, tell me why.

1030
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:59,775
A fella I knew in El Paso took all
his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.

1031
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:01,970
I asked him the same question: why?

1032
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,093
And?

1033
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:07,974
He said "It seemed to be
a good idea at the time."

1034
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,856
Good!

1035
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,338
Right.

1036
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:53,499
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.

1037
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:56,134
Your friends in there
owe you at least that much.

1038
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:59,775
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.

1039
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:17,337
You know, the first time
I took a job as a hired gun,...

1040
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:21,135
..a fella told me
"Vin, you can't afford to care."

1041
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:23,492
There's your problem.

1042
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:26,418
One thing I don't need
is somebody telling me my problem.

1043
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:28,895
Like I said before, that's your problem.

1044
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:32,774
You got involved in this village
and the people in it.

1045
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:37,450
Do you ever get tired
of hearing yourself talk?

1046
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:41,493
The reason I understand
your problem so well...

1047
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:44,612
..is that I walked into
the same trap myself.

1048
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,053
Yeah.

1049
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:50,411
The first day we got here,
I started thinking...

1050
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:54,453
..maybe I could put my gun away
and settle down and get a little land,...

1051
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,172
..raise some cattle.

1052
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:00,771
The things that these people know
about me wouldn't work against me.

1053
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:05,690
l, uh... just didn't want you to think
you were the only sucker in town.

1054
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:25,734
- Can we go with you, Bernardo?
- No.

1055
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:28,579
- You like us, don't you?
- I guess so.

1056
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:32,215
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm one of us all right.

1057
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:34,729
- Take us with you! Please?
- No!

1058
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:38,978
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.

1059
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:45,771
Don't ever say that again
about your fathers.

1060
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,652
They are not cowards!

1061
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:52,728
You think I am brave
because I carry a gun.

1062
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:56,489
Your fathers are much braver
because they carry responsibility.

1063
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:59,293
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

1064
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:02,890
This responsibility
is like a big rock that weighs a ton.

1065
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:07,093
It bends and it twists them until finally
it buries them under the ground.

1066
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:11,338
Nobody says they have to do it. They do it
because they love you and they want to.

1067
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:16,490
I have <i>never</i> had this kind of courage.

1068
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,451
Running a farm,...

1069
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:24,813
..working like a mule, with no guarantee
what will become of it - this is bravery.

1070
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:29,853
That's why I never
even started anything like that.

1071
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:31,936
That's why I never will.

1072
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:49,337
You'll do much better
on the other side of the border.

1073
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:52,497
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.

1074
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:56,408
All you have to face is a sheriff,
a marshal.

1075
01:46:56,540 --> 01:46:58,735
Once I rob a bank in Texas.

1076
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:02,250
Your government got after me
with a whole army. A whole army!

1077
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:05,776
One little bank. It's clear, the meaning?

1078
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:09,137
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!

1079
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:18,779
¡Adiós!

1080
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:04,611
¡Adiós!

1081
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:16,218
I could have told you they'd sell us out.

1082
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,896
Farmers...

1083
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,654
Farmers!

1084
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:37,453
No honour, no loyalty - nothin'.

1085
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:43,849
All they care about is their precious crops
and the miserable dirt they dig in.

1086
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:48,370
I hate 'em.

1087
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:52,692
- I hate 'em all.
- Sure you hate them.

1088
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:58,096
Because you come
from a village just like that one.

1089
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:00,415
You yourself are a farmer.

1090
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:04,816
Yes.

1091
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:07,370
Yes, I'm one of them.

1092
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:11,294
But who made us the way we are? Hm?

1093
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:14,170
Men with guns.

1094
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:17,813
Men like Calvera and...

1095
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:20,410
..men like you.

1096
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:23,849
And now me.

1097
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,449
So what d'you expect us to be?

1098
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:39,257
Nobody throws me my own guns
and says run. Nobody.

1099
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:44,538
It took me a long, long time
to learn my elbow from a hot rock.

1100
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:50,011
Right now, I belong back in that
border town, sleepin' on white sheets.

1101
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:56,057
I think I'll ride back to that village.

1102
01:49:56,780 --> 01:50:01,729
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift
a finger to help. Think of the odds.

1103
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:05,978
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.

1104
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:09,818
Ride on, Harry. It's all right.

1105
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:12,500
Bet your sweet life, I will!

1106
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:21,253
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed? Let 'em.

1107
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:25,259
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.

1108
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:28,930
Except to myself.

1109
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:43,775
You're crazy! All of ya!

1110
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:46,130
Come on. Ya!

1111
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:58,936
<i>(gunshots)</i>

1112
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:19,216
<i>(gunshots)</i>

1113
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:38,296
<i>(gunshots)</i>

1114
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:22,856
Hold on, Chris, I'll get ya outta there!

1115
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:03,654
- Chris...
- Yes, Harry?

1116
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,736
I'd hate to die a sucker.

1117
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:09,569
We didn't come here just to keep an eye
on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.

1118
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:12,498
There was something else
all the time, wasn't there?

1119
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:16,215
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.

1120
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:17,978
I knew it.

1121
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:20,091
What was it?

1122
01:54:20,220 --> 01:54:22,051
Gold.

1123
01:54:22,180 --> 01:54:26,332
- Sacks of it.
- Oh... sounds beautiful!

1124
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:30,570
- How much?
- At least a half a million.

1125
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:34,409
- My cut woulda been what?
- About 70,000.

1126
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:39,334
- I'll be damned!
<i>- (kicking at door)</i>

1127
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:49,097
- Maybe you won't be.
<i>- (window smashes)</i>

1128
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:04,016

1129
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:58,936

1130
01:56:44,660 --> 01:56:46,616
<i>(gunshot)</i>

1131
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,655
You came back.

1132
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:20,135
For a place like this.

1133
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:22,736
Why?

1134
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:24,811
A man like you?

1135
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:28,056
Why?

1136
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:04,779
- Bernardo! Bernardo!
- No. No, get back. Go on! Get back.

1137
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:09,936
<i>(gunshot)</i>

1138
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:18,049
We didn't... We didn't mean to do it.

1139
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:20,410
We didn't mean to do it.

1140
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:27,130
You see?

1141
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:30,377
I told you. You see your fathers?

1142
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,256
<i>(gasps in pain)</i>

1143
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:41,216
What's my name?

1144
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:44,298
- Bernardo.
- Bernardo!

1145
01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:48,169
You're damn right.

1146
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:37,970
You could stay, you know.

1147
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:40,978
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.

1148
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:46,614
- They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
- Yes. The fighting is over.

1149
01:59:46,740 --> 01:59:48,696
Your work is done.

1150
01:59:48,820 --> 01:59:51,539
For them, each season has its tasks.

1151
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:56,973
If there were a season for gratitude,
they'd show it more.

1152
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:01,735
We didn't get any more
than we expected, old man.

1153
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:05,010
Only the farmers have won.

1154
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:08,369
They remain for ever.

1155
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:11,094
They are like the land itself.

1156
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:14,768
You helped to rid them of Calvera,...

1157
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:18,735
..the way a strong wind
helps rid them of locusts.

1158
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,616
You are like the wind,...

1159
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:26,336
..blowing over the land and passing on.

1160
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:32,655
God be with you.

1161
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:37,248
Adiós.

1162
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:19,856
Adiós.

1163
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:26,848
Adiós.

1164
02:01:57,820 --> 02:02:00,209
The old man was right.

1165
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:02,376
Only the farmers won.

1166
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,456
We lost.

1167
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:07,335
We always lose.
