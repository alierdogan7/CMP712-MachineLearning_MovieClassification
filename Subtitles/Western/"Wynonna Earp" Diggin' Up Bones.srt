00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,559
<i>- Previously on Wynonna Earp...
- Willa!</i>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,813
Who have you hurt the most?

3
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:05,379
- [gunshot]
- [screaming]

4
00:00:05,404 --> 00:00:06,789
I forgive her!

5
00:00:06,818 --> 00:00:08,692
- Just one crazy girl.
- You're saying

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,903
Bobo's hiding
Revenants in the trailer park?

7
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:13,189
You wanna win this war, we do it my way.

8
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:15,032
Are you gonna tell me you're kicking

9
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,775
it with the ghost of Doc Holliday?

10
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:20,496
Demons walk among us, and
they mean to end my line.

11
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:22,364
You don't wanna do this!

12
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,283
You have no idea what I want.

13
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,919
- Revenge.
- Seems like you're just my type.

14
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:29,255
What makes you think that you are mine?

15
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,675
Willa!?

16
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:39,798
Willa!

17
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,690
Willa!

18
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,623
[screaming]

19
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:22,508
- Willa?
- It's Wynonna.

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,561
Your sister, the bag of
chaos you live with?

21
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:31,901
[gasping]

22
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:33,736
But this is...

23
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:36,689
but Willa's gone. Dead.

24
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:39,825
I'm alive. Right?

25
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:55,090
Get them.

26
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:57,793
Dude, I did! I have! Look!

27
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:02,431
I killed them so hard.

28
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,718
Sent their creepy
asses back where they belong.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,387
Not all of them. [echoing]

30
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,681
Willa?!

31
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:16,807
Willa, you can't be here...

32
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:19,865
Daddy couldn't save us.

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,201
How the hell will
you? They'll eat you alive.

34
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:24,236
[screaming]

35
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,082
Oh! Here.

36
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:39,918
OK. OK.

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,671
Nan always said the
Prairie winds bring in bad dreams.

38
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:45,257
- Those're some brutal winds.
- Here,

39
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:47,977
- drink some water.
- Is it beer o'clock?

40
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:51,146
Mix it with tomato
juice and it's breakfast.

41
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,515
Only if you throw a raw egg

42
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,851
and some
horseradish in there too, Daddy.

43
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:58,103
[gun falling to ground]

44
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,989
Whoops-a-daisy.

45
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,778
You can't keep doing this.

46
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,314
Killing people and
pretending like it doesn't affect you.

47
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:12,951
I'm more than halfway through The Seven.

48
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:15,587
Yeah, but there are, like,
seventy-seven in the curse, OK?

49
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:18,290
You're barely five
percent of the way in.

50
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,793
You and your math both suck.

51
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:29,018
You called out Willa's name.

52
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:33,188
I miss her.

53
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,309
I can't quite remember...

54
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,361
Did she have pierced ears?

55
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:45,034
Yeah.

56
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:51,824
One piece at a time.

57
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:54,326
That's how people slip away.

58
00:03:56,747 --> 00:03:58,714
Daddy said revenge

59
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,632
was a balm for the soul.

60
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:03,052
If I kill the evil that
took him and our sister,

61
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:06,004
then we can dream, and
remember, and it won't have to be sad.

62
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:12,010
Try to get some sleep, OK?

63
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:14,813
Tracking down
Revenants can wait 'til morning.

64
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,317

Good.

I thought I was suffering some

What's on the agenda today?

81
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:32,307
The City Manager's
requested a meeting, so I need you

82
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:34,309
to put on your grown-up face.

83
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,311
I have one of those?

84
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:38,680
This is the chief
executive officer of Purgatory.

85
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:42,100
- And a judge.
- It's not like he's the law.

86
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:44,102
He decides who is the law.

87
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:46,155
And...

88
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,023
he could shut us down,

89
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,609
so we need to be on his good side.

90
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,111
So get yourself chest already.

91
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:55,280
Dressed. Already.

92
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:57,282
Don't wanna keep
Judgey Manager Dude waiting.

93
00:05:57,284 --> 00:06:00,752
Cryderman. Let's not
keep Judge Cryderman waiting.

94
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,623
Record scratch.

95
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,208
Judge who?

96
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,377
I've been meaning

97
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:10,379
to call you in,

98
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,965
but we've had some unfortunate issues

99
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,967
with the Town Planner.

100
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:17,553
Is that the man that lost his
arm in the biking accident?

101
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:20,272
Some things just work out.

102
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:22,975
Of course. Judge, you
have a terrific town here

103
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:25,143
and my partner and I
want to help make sure

104
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,301
- it stays that way.
- Exactly.

105
00:06:27,302 --> 00:06:29,982
That's why I wanna know what
the hell you're doing here, Dolls?

106
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:32,901
- As you know, the U.S. Marshals...
- Joint Task Force,

107
00:06:32,953 --> 00:06:35,571
Special Assignment, etcetera.
I know this.

108
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:38,207
The Crydermans have been in Purgatory

109
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:40,659
for over 140 years. And
we like to keep tabs.

110
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,995
It's a small town thing.

111
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:44,201
Are criminals, drug dealers and

112
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:45,701
gangbangers a small town thing too?

113
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:49,084
As a Judge,

114
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:51,637
you always wonder where
the bad seeds end up.

115
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:55,368
Turns out, right back here in my office.

116
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:56,782
Where d'ya think Bobo Del Rey

117
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,977
will end up? Or do you
not keep tabs on him?

118
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:02,264
Mr. Del Rey may not be an Ivy Leaguer,

119
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:04,266
but he's no moron.

120
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:06,018
To be honest, Judge, I'm less concerned

121
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,520
about Bobo's IQ, and more concerned

122
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:09,187
about his potential criminal activity.

123
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,773
What criminal activity?

124
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:16,695
This crate was delivered to
his trailer. I took the photo

125
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,997
- this morning.
- Could be anything.

126
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:21,439
Then why are his
colleagues guarding it with guns?

127
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:23,085
He has connections. Do
you know what that means?

128
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,550
It means trouble. But only if my

129
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:26,204
partner and I overstep our bounds.

130
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,290
I don't like extra work

131
00:07:28,342 --> 00:07:30,592
cluttering things up. Especially
during duck season.

132
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:32,254
You know what I've heard? There's a

133
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,880
bumper crop of mallards this year.

134
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:35,681
You a duck-huntin' man?

135
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,966
Maybe I'll give you a
call on migration day.

136
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:39,768
You give us a chance to prove

137
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:41,872
that Bobo's heading
up a criminal conspiracy?

138
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:42,771
[snapping fingers]

139
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:45,607
And I'll have a thermos
of bourbon at the ready.

140
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:47,609
[laughing]

141
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,444
Can we get back to business here?

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,563
I'll have a warrant sent
over within the hour.

143
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:53,649
Thank you very much, Judge.

144
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,034
It's a shame, what went south

145
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,036
with this girl.

146
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:00,038
Born bad, I think.

147
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,040
Her daddy was a real legend.

148
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:05,327
I'm just glad the dead rest easy.

149
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:10,553
Gum?

150
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:12,551
Might take the taste of
judge anus out of your mouth.

151
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:14,553
Look, I know you got a
history with the judge,

152
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:17,889
but we hit jackpot. A search warrant.

153
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:19,891
I'm a 27-year-old
woman cursed with shooting

154
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:22,047
demon-adjacent revenants who
bleed frothing brown goo,

155
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,904
and now I have to
worry about search warrants?!

156
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:28,255
This is all the warrant I
need. And Bobo's an easy target.

157
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,736
You know what happens if
you shoot Bobo in a trailer park

158
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,938
filled with humans,
women and children, right?

159
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,702
One more checkmark on my to-do list?

160
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,741
Someone records him

161
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:38,443
being sucked into the
ground. Puts it online.

162
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:41,413
It goes viral. The government bombs

163
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:43,915
the Ghost River Triangle,
conspiracy theorists go mad

164
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:46,251
and you spend the remainder
of your days in a psych ward.

165
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,787
Oh, if you're not dead already.

166
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,758
- So we do it by the stupid book.
- You, me,

167
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,676
and a collection of local finest.

168
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,878
We get to use legit cops?

169
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,797
Dolls, you coulda led with that.

170
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:03,935
Waverly will stake the
place out during the raid

171
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:06,138
and photograph anyone she
sees. Doc will come down,

172
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,106
see if he recognizes anyone

173
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:10,330
- from the old days.
- Cryderman know about this?

174
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:11,775
Shh.

175
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:15,564
- Nope.
- Aw, there's a little rebel in there.

176
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:17,949
Not that little.

177
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:30,078
What is there? A sale on lawn chairs?

178
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,998
Park's looking mighty empty.

179
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:43,141
Hey, you find any clippers in
there? I got this hangnail

180
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,760
that's just driving me nuts.

181
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:00,859
While you're down there, Deputy
Whatever-The-Hell Earp,

182
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:02,861
my knobs need some polishing.

183
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,671
Actually, there's a lot around here

184
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:07,165
that could use a woman's touch.

185
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,451
Officer, could you take
him outside, please?

186
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:11,503
Now.

187
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:12,921
All right.

188
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:20,929
He's clearly a criminal, so where's
the stuff to prove it?!

189
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:22,631
Time to regroup.

190
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:26,184
Something's wrong, Dolls. I feel it.

191
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,854
[grunting]

192
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,889
Back...

193
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:34,893
Doc...

194
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:39,030
die!

195
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:41,566
Wooden crate.

196
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,985
Five feet by two by one.

197
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,789
Not ringin' any bells.

198
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:50,408
I saw you receive it.

199
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,711
Where's it at? What's in it?

200
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:55,464
Oh, yeah. Um...

201
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,716
- No, still not ringing.
- I think it's time

202
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,718
that I talk to some of your 'friends'.

203
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,504
- Where can I find them?
- Big sale on yoga mats

204
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,589
down at Lululemon.

205
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:07,142
He's just gonna keep
jerking us around. This won't work.

206
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:09,811
You in the mood to take a trip downtown,

207
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:12,013
Bobo?

208
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:14,983
Easy, boys.

209
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:17,102
I'm think I'm comfy right here.

210
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:20,188
But maybe Deputy Earp over there

211
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,357
might want to give
me a little underdoggy,

212
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,860
get the breeze going?

213
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:34,870
Uh-oh...

214
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:36,621
All I want

215
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,874
are the scumbags who came for Ward Earp.

216
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:41,042
Two of them are still alive.

217
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,512
Tell me who they are,
and we leave you alone.

218
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,104
- Get down.
- Wynonna's

219
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,932
going all Wynonna again.

220
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:49,267
Two choices. You can help me...

221
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:52,771
- Deputy Earp!
- Or you can not help me, and die.

222
00:11:57,861 --> 00:11:59,110
Really?

223
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:00,862
You can't arrest me, Mr. Dolls.

224
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:11,072
Once it's done, it's done.

225
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:13,658
There will be no mercy for you.

226
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,911
Thanks for the tip.

227
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,556
[gasping]

228
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,591
Oh shit.

229
00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:41,353
Find, Distance to Puerto Vallarta.

230
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:44,823
<i>Total distance - 2,696 miles</i>

231
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:46,825
<i>or one day and 19 hours.</i>

232
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,827
<i>Begin guidance?</i>

233
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,613
This shit would just follow
me to the beach anyway.

234
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:57,412
Hey, look.

235
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:59,996
Evidence Bobo can't
get his porn off the 'net.

236
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:02,248
Resisting arrest. Resisting arrest.

237
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,384
Possession for half an ounce.

238
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,336
Pot brownie. And don't think

239
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:08,053
I wasn't tempted to
eat it on the way back.

240
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,342
You know none of these charges are gonna

241
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,473
stick, right? This is what happens

242
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:12,725
when you go cowboy. We got nothing.

243
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:15,979
We blew it. And now I
gotta cover for you.

244
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:18,731
- You don't have to do anything.
- I have to do my job.

245
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,784
When are you gonna get it, Wynonna?

246
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,209
I'm not a cop, Dolls.

247
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,310
OK? So let me just do things my way.

248
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,822
Your way isn't working.

249
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,577
You think I don't get worked up over

250
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:29,158
these bastards, the same as you?

251
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:32,528
- Who knows what you feel, Dolls.
- I have to deal with Cryderman.

252
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,947
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No.

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,418
You've done enough damage for one day.

254
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:44,374
Waverly said the
trailer park was so empty

255
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:46,843
it looked like
Sharknado had ripped through it.

256
00:13:46,878 --> 00:13:49,345
Sounds like Bobo was tipped off.

257
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,687
[door opening]

258
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:59,889
It's about time.

259
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,891
I'm starved. Just leave it on the table.

260
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:03,810
I'm not your lunch.

261
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:09,032
- Least I hope not.
- Well, come in, come in.

262
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:12,368
- To what do I owe...
- Who told you

263
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,537
I was watching you?

264
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,658
Huh? Nobody else knew where I was.

265
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,576
Nobody.

266
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:24,213
You're shorter than I remember.

267
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:29,469
And you're taller than I remember.

268
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,006
Sit.

269
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,267
Why,

270
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,852
when I was little,

271
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:47,854
did you choose me

272
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,489
to manipulate? Huh?

273
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:51,491
Because I was gullible?

274
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:55,111
- Weak?
- Weak...

275
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:58,081
is something you've never been.

276
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:02,785
I...

277
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:04,787
chose you...

278
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,925
because you were angry.

279
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I wasn't angry.

280
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,345
You sure?

281
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,465
- I'm not, OK?
- You've got depths

282
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:17,467
that neither of us

283
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,353
know the bottom of yet. Trust me.

284
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:22,772
You don't know anything about me.

285
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,140
Oh?

286
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,726
Except maybe what happened to Willa.

287
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:29,312
Nothing good.

288
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:33,900
Get out.

289
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:36,569
Goodbye.

290
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,622
Well now there then,

291
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:41,958
isn't my dance card full.

292
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:55,254
Privacy,

293
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:57,473
finally.

294
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,085
But something tells me you're not

295
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,917
here to give me a lap dance, are you?

296
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:03,868
It's a shame to waste

297
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:07,016
those beautiful tits of yours.

298
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:09,402
Thank you, Bobo,

299
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,904
for making this so damn easy.

300
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
And what would that be, sweetheart?

301
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:18,945
Blowing a giant hole in your head.

302
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:21,914
OK, Wynonna, you don't wanna do this.

303
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,200
And I don't want to die.

304
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,203
I can't die.

305
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:29,422
At least, I'd rather not.

306
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,758
You're a hot mess in tight jeans.

307
00:16:32,794 --> 00:16:35,845
You want to pump bullets into my head?

308
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,381
I got some bullets I'd
like to pump into you too.

309
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:39,979
- Yeah, eat shit.
- Or maybe your

310
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,434
pretty little sister of yours.

311
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:43,102
Watch your mouth.

312
00:16:45,056 --> 00:16:46,772
You watch your mouth.

313
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:49,108
You think those shoulders are heavy now?

314
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,227
You wait

315
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,230
until everyone you love is in agony.

316
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:56,899
[outside door buzzing]

317
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,989
[heels clicking]

318
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,962
Don't say another word, Robert.

319
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,714
Ms. Stone.

320
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:16,335
Hey!

321
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,838
You're releasing
him? On whose authority?

322
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,347
You have a lawyer?

323
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,409
Don't you start.

324
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,612
Bad time to ask you for a lift?

325
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:46,249
I guess so.

326
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,038
Dick.

327
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,791
No sudden moves.

328
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,044
You're gonna give me your cell phone.

329
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:00,296
- [grunting]
- OK.

330
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:03,132
Here.

331
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:05,134
I saw how you handled Bobo's guys.

332
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:07,270
Now we're gonna pay him another visit.

333
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:08,995
I was just thinking
I need another man to

334
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,830
tell me what to do today,
and here you are!

335
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:12,224
Awesome!

336
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:14,026
Not to be rude, but
can we cut the chitchat?

337
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:16,112
I get car sick real bad.

338
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,730
Absolutely. Anything else?

339
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:20,032
Drive-thru fro-yo? Slurpee run?

340
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,734
Just drive.

341
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:28,574
[tires screeching]

342
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:33,663
That girl could use a cigarillo.

343
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,759
Del Rey and his
lawyers are considering suing

344
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:48,761
for unreasonable search and seizure.

345
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:50,964
- Know what that means?
- Insufficient cause for action.

346
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:51,705
And my name

347
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,317
gets dragged through the
mud by some overpaid battle-axe.

348
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:57,236
- What can I do, sir?
- I'll get the lawyer back

349
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:59,188
before five. You draft an apology,

350
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,024
and personally deliver
it. Bring your protégée.

351
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,493
Protégée?

352
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:07,697
You hire somebody for
their ass, you're responsible

353
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,950
- for covering it.
- That's out of line, sir.

354
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:10,724
I disagree.

355
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:12,668
And don't ask me for another warrant

356
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:14,503
unless there's something
there worth finding.

357
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,372
Something was there.

358
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:19,375
And for some reason, Bobo
was a step ahead of us.

359
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:24,296
If I need to move up
the chain of command...

360
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:27,133
Please. Your
superiors have been calling me,

361
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:30,052
Deputy Marshal. Asking if,
given your lack of results,

362
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,304
I think you should continue
in your position.

363
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,523
Really?

364
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,609
Who you been talking to?

365
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:47,820
What should I tell them?

366
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:02,134
Put your hands on your
stupid little head.

367
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,004
I think I'm gonna be sick. Nope.

368
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,972
It passed. Don't shoot.

369
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:10,259
- I know who attacked your family.
- Oh! Did you see us?

370
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:12,678
That was awesome! Hey, we
saw you leaving the cop shop

371
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,564
driving like a maniac so... Oh shit.

372
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,517
- Names. Now.
- OK, thing is,

373
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:21,437
I don't exactly have their names.

374
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:23,105
But I have a picture of all seven.

375
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:25,908
Standing by your dad's dead body.

376
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:27,743
If you wanna know

377
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,495
who's been killing the heirs,

378
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,782
- who'll eventually come for you...
- Fish?!

379
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,284
That is you!

380
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,787
[laughing]

381
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,090
- You old sonofagun.
- Well, dang my melt.

382
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,092
It's Doc Holliday!

383
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,377
[laughing]

384
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,179
Dang, boy!

385
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,133
You do not call me

386
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:53,769
to deal with your petty affairs.

387
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:57,940
Next time,

388
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:59,775
I expect it to be

389
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:02,144
for my reasons.

390
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,993
I hear them.

391
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,296
They call and they call,

392
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:22,298
they cry and they cry.

393
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,550
They won't stop.

394
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,635
Why won't they stop?

395
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:28,754
My head...

396
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:31,173
We're getting close, Constance.

397
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:35,311
Or should I call you

398
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:38,514
by your alias, Miz Stone?

399
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,151
[gasping]

400
00:21:44,155 --> 00:21:47,823
It's Mrs. Clootie.

401
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:52,278
[cracking]

402
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:55,716
Now.

403
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,752
Tell me, what is it with you

404
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:02,755
and those damn Earp girls?

405
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,996
- You're ridiculous.
- [screaming]

406
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:09,128
Always chasing one of
them with your tongue out.

407
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,680
Suck it up, revenant.

408
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:13,265
All of it.

409
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:17,186
You wanna know power?

410
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:20,022
Suck.

411
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:22,441
It. Up.

412
00:22:25,638 --> 00:22:27,675
OK, boy.

413
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:28,701
You look good.

414
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:31,286
What happened? Yatt
were thick as thieves.

415
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,988
- How come he turned you revenant?
- He didn't.

416
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,333
I'm still me. Except not.

417
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:39,827
Not to mention a sight for sore eyes!

418
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,997
Trout, Pickerel, whatever
your name is. Can we focus?

419
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,551
Doc, don't you feel a tad thirsty?

420
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:49,220
Well, if you're
buyin, I am always thirsty.

421
00:22:53,143 --> 00:22:54,926
So, about this picture.

422
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:56,978
I saw you at the trailer park,

423
00:22:57,013 --> 00:22:58,980
standing up to Bobo?

424
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:00,982
And I knew you could help me.

425
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:04,068
- With?
- Got caught up in a scheme.

426
00:23:04,104 --> 00:23:07,105
Somebody I love. I was weak.

427
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:09,157
Some chick turn you to a life of crime?

428
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:11,109
Haven't heard that song before.

429
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:13,161
It wasn't a chick.

430
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,915
Oh! OK. Yep.

431
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,367
Life could be pretty
lonely for a fella like me.

432
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,120
Back in those days. You can imagine.

433
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:24,289
And then, the most beautiful man

434
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,507
I'd ever seen.

435
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:28,876
A photographer. Daguerreotypes,

436
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,095
- you know what those are?
- Old-timey pictures, right?

437
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:32,797
Mm-hmm.

438
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,099
He walked right up to me on the street.

439
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:37,435
He was so bold that way.

440
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,354
Sold me on getting my photo done.

441
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:41,723
You had to sit completely still.

442
00:23:41,775 --> 00:23:44,859
My stomach was
fluttering something awful.

443
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:46,861
We just stared at each other.

444
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:48,980
And stared.

445
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,982
By the time the photo was finished...

446
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:53,451
How blarfably romantic.

447
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:55,453
We promised

448
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:58,156
that if we were ever struck
down by Peacemaker,

449
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,042
next time we regenerated,
we'd meet at the same day,

450
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:02,961
time and place.

451
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:04,662
So, what? He didn't show?

452
00:24:04,714 --> 00:24:07,165
I went to the trailer
park. All folk knew

453
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,001
was that he'd struck some deal
with Bobo. A deal that went bad.

454
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:12,754
Which finally brings us
around to you in my truck

455
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:15,423
- and a knife at my throat.
- I need to know if he's OK.

456
00:24:15,475 --> 00:24:17,759
Or not.

457
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,978
And if we could find out?

458
00:24:20,013 --> 00:24:22,146
I'd die a happy man.

459
00:24:22,182 --> 00:24:24,932
Shoot me ten times if you want.

460
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,486
You really have a photo of the Seven?

461
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:31,489
My fella took all their hunting photos.

462
00:24:31,524 --> 00:24:34,942
Them with their "trophies". The heirs.

463
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:37,161
So I help you...

464
00:24:37,197 --> 00:24:40,615
I help you back.

465
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,872
You're gonna want to talk to Vinnie.

466
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:50,708
He's alone at a crab shack.

467
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:58,216
Whoa.

468
00:24:58,218 --> 00:25:00,218
So?

469
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,270
I'm paying a visit to
a guy named Vinnie.

470
00:25:02,305 --> 00:25:04,272
Vinnie the Vulture?

471
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:07,725
Wynonna, he don't give
up information so easy.

472
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:09,727
I'll get it out of
him any way I need to.

473
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:12,196
Have you ever tortured anybody before?

474
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:14,148
Does six-year-old Waverly
count? 'Cause...

475
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,034
Hurtin' and killin', Wynonna, they are

476
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:19,620
two very different things.

477
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:22,573
Yeah. I got this.

478
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,209
- Alone?
- [sighing]

479
00:25:25,245 --> 00:25:27,912
Look, you stay here,

480
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:29,797
keep an eye on your little friend.

481
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:33,418
If this is a trap and I die, gut him.

482
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:46,397
So you weren't expecting guests?

483
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:47,899
Why you wanna find

484
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,234
some brokeback Nancy's boyfriend anyway?

485
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,738
- Why is he your problem?
- I made a promise.

486
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:55,440
A deal.

487
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:58,109
I'm trying to become the
type of woman who keeps her word.

488
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:01,195
Oh, you have a 'code'? That's cute.

489
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:04,031
Don't make me hurt you.

490
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,033
Where's the photographer?

491
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,536
Earps.

492
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,422
Always trying to cut filthy little deals

493
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:14,759
whenever it suits them. [smacking lips]

494
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:22,133
This is the good part.

495
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:28,723
- Dad?
- You enjoy yourself, baby girl.

496
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:31,726
Vengeance is fun.

497
00:26:31,778 --> 00:26:34,896
It's what we live for.

498
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:37,448
Nice party trick,

499
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:40,151
but Ward didn't sound like that.

500
00:26:41,204 --> 00:26:43,371
I just need information.

501
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:45,990
Mm-hmm. You keep telling yourself that.

502
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,242
As long as you're having fun...

503
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:50,545
No!

504
00:26:52,882 --> 00:26:55,082
- Where is the photographer?
- Come on now,

505
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:58,636
don't wuss out, honey! Why
don't you go for the wrist

506
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:01,923
- or the neck?
- I'm not trying to kill him.

507
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:04,475
It'll make you feel better. For a while.

508
00:27:04,511 --> 00:27:06,093
Then you'll have to kill another,

509
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:08,763
but that's OK. It kept
me busy. I loved it.

510
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:10,148
You're not my dad!

511
00:27:10,183 --> 00:27:13,484
Now tell me what I need to know!

512
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,940
Tell me.

513
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:21,192
- Tell me!
- Hell's Gate!

514
00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:24,612
Bobo had Doc take Levi over Hell's Gate.

515
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:27,865
Across the line, so he'd fry.

516
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:30,368
To torture him, teach him a lesson.

517
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,703
Doc Holliday?

518
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,705
Levi begged and begged him to stop.

519
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:36,707
You would have loved it.

520
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,010
Go on, don't stop now.

521
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:41,596
'Cause we won't. Not
until you're in pieces,

522
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:43,631
like your big sister, Willa.

523
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:49,136
OK.

524
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:57,061
- [gunshot]
- You OK?

525
00:27:58,565 --> 00:27:59,697
I know where he is.

526
00:27:59,732 --> 00:28:03,067
Vinnie told me where Bobo put him.

527
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,236
I can take you there,

528
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:07,376
but I get my photo of the Seven first.

529
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:08,096
Sure.

530
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:10,074
Thing is, we might need to commit

531
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:12,493
a little tiny break-and-enter

532
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,791
- to get our hands on it.
- Where, Fish?

533
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:15,713
The basement

534
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:18,466
- of the civic building.
- That's the police station.

535
00:28:18,501 --> 00:28:20,885
You want me to break
into the place I work?

536
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:24,505
Yeah, OK. I'm
surprised it took me this long.

537
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:26,075
Now, if we can get our hands on some

538
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,699
dynamite, and scale the North wall...

539
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:30,394
- I got something better.
- What is better than dynamite?

540
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,430
Boobs.

541
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:41,916
Ugh! How do you boys work in this heat?

542
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,955
Ladies. Even better!

543
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,258
I wonder if you might
be able to help me out?

544
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,627
No? Nothing?

545
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,379
OK. Yeah.

546
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:57,181
Pardon me, ladies,

547
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,267
but I seem to have gotten myself

548
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:01,469
the tiniest bit lost.

549
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:05,940
In short, ma'am, my
partner and I sincerely apologize

550
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,942
for the embarrassment on Mr. Del Rey

551
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:09,817
for our unnecessary and
unprofessional conduct.

552
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,483
Where is his partner? Surely you know

553
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:18,069
I cannot consider this a full

554
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:21,372
- and plenary quittance.
- Now now, Cece.

555
00:29:21,407 --> 00:29:23,374
Surely you know

556
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,660
our whole municipal
system can't be held accountable

557
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:27,712
for every halfwit who
goes off half-cocked.

558
00:29:27,747 --> 00:29:29,213
Dolls?

559
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:32,416
We do our best to
maintain discipline in the ranks.

560
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:34,335
Ma'am.

561
00:29:34,387 --> 00:29:36,387
Miss Earp is a lowlife,

562
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:38,139
but we can't be responsible.

563
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:40,550
Deputy Marshal Dolls
knows he's made a mistake.

564
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:41,366
Wynonna

565
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:44,061
is an unconventional vital
asset to my team.

566
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:46,814
She is a survivor that never gives up.

567
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,900
And we could do with fewer child abusers

568
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:50,768
behind the bench.

569
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,765
<i>Warning. The building is now under</i>

570
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,488
<i>a carbon monoxide evacuation.</i>

571
00:29:54,524 --> 00:29:57,525
<i>Please exit in a
calm and orderly manner.</i>

572
00:29:57,577 --> 00:30:00,444
<i>If you are dizzy or
weak, inform a co-worker now.</i>

573
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,997
I've got some phone calls to make.

574
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:05,032
To your bosses.

575
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:07,251
Do whatever you like.

576
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:10,755
And your bourbon's for shit.

577
00:30:14,794 --> 00:30:16,961
Uh, alarm! You need to evacuate.

578
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:19,539
Uh, this just doesn't make sense to me.

579
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:20,405
'Sense'?

580
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:22,550
Carbon monoxide!

581
00:30:22,602 --> 00:30:24,936
- Colourless, odourless, lethal?
- Not to be hurtful,

582
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:27,021
but I know better than to take anything

583
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:29,056
at face value when
there's an Earp in the vicinity.

584
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:32,777
Especially if they're
claiming to look out for you.

585
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:39,734
- Nice. Good instincts, Dickenson.
- We better shake a leg.

586
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:44,906
Hello?

587
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:52,496
So this is the Black Badge Division.

588
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:57,802
My, my.

589
00:30:57,837 --> 00:31:00,254
Dolls has been busy.

590
00:31:01,507 --> 00:31:04,842
- You looking for something?
- Goddamn. It's you.

591
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:14,018
How was it down there?

592
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,237
Chilly, I bet.

593
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:19,190
One burnin' thought kept me warm.

594
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,944
Încá tu sunt piatrâ,

595
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:26,247
John Henry

596
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:28,449
Holliday.

597
00:31:28,501 --> 00:31:30,668
Înca tu sunt piatrâ,

598
00:31:30,703 --> 00:31:32,670
mort fârâ

599
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:34,705
emu

600
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:37,258
mângâia,

601
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:40,795
tu somn somn somn...

602
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:59,981
Yo, Fish.

603
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:02,900
The problem with this
whole criminal thing

604
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:05,453
is that it's kinda fun.

605
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:08,906
That is one of the
problems, Fish. But there are other...

606
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,213
Bigger problems.

607
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:21,552
Run. Thank you!

608
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:40,738
- You get your precious photos?
- It's just a box of negatives.

609
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:42,248
We have to find someplace to develop...

610
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:44,775
No. No, you take me to him now.

611
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:47,995
- Gear down, bro. We have a deal.
- I can't live like this,

612
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:49,780
not anymore,

613
00:32:49,782 --> 00:32:51,916
not knowing...

614
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:53,918
Please, God, Wynonna!

615
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,348
You had your way with the Vulture!

616
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,728
Are you going to torture me too?

617
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:59,623
The dates on the negatives match up.

618
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:05,596
Yeah, fine, OK. We'll take you to Levi.

619
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:08,045
Well, to where Vinnie
said he was, at least.

620
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,850
Levi?

621
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:11,469
Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you.

622
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,306
So Vinnie wasn't lying.

623
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:17,358
And don't try to tell me

624
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:18,976
you just know Levi
from the good old days.

625
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:19,860
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

626
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:21,979
But the name should ring
a bell with you too,

627
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:23,981
'cause the last time you saw him,

628
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:26,617
he'd gotten himself mixed
up with a Shadow Assassin.

629
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:31,405
That guy?

630
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:41,632
He's here? You're sure?

631
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,017
Don't get your hopes up. We don't

632
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,192
know what we're gonna find.

633
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,220
Fish, you cross that line,

634
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:48,472
and you will live a
thousand lifetimes of agony.

635
00:33:48,508 --> 00:33:51,392
But you can cross, though. Right?

636
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:55,396
Whatever we happen upon,

637
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:58,015
I think we should tell
Fish we didn't find anything.

638
00:33:58,017 --> 00:34:00,351
I don't give a rat's ass
if he's a pile of carrion.

639
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:01,909
- We made a deal.
- Have you

640
00:34:01,934 --> 00:34:03,821
seen what happens to revenants

641
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:06,240
that cross the Ghost River boundary?

642
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:08,742
Not up close.

643
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:10,778
But you have.

644
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:14,115
Well, it ain't gonna be pretty.

645
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,670
[flies buzzing]

646
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:20,997
Clearly.

647
00:34:21,156 --> 00:34:24,402
I should've gone for Puerto Vallarta
when I had the chance.

648
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:34,094
The revenat steps over the line for a
second and it's pure torture for them.

649
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:35,240
So what the hell happens if you

650
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:36,963
leave 'em staked out here for days?

651
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,325
It wasn't my idea to do this.

652
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:42,361
Oh, well, the fact that you were duped

653
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,363
into doing Bobo's dirty
work makes it all better.

654
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,198
Bobo wanted to make an example

655
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,868
of Levi so people
wouldn't cross him. I don't have

656
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,087
a Black Badge Division backing
me up, so I was not

657
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:54,506
in a position to be refusin'.

658
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:57,626
He chewed off his foot like an animal.

659
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,014
Where's the rest of him?

660
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:05,601
Well, looks like he
crawled back to safety.

661
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,554
Hey, you guys? What's happening?

662
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,121
This is the only way to sanctuary.

663
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,331
[man sobbing]

664
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,335
Fish?

665
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,814
[sobbing]

666
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,070
[sobbing]

667
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,940
Just thought you'd want to say goodbye.

668
00:36:05,446 --> 00:36:07,579
Levi?

669
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,784
It's me. Ambrose.

670
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:15,671
Your Ambrose.

671
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,123
What'd you do to Bobo?

672
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,511
What'd you do this time, bad boy?

673
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:25,047
You just could never help yourself.

674
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:28,216
No matter what I said,
you were gonna do wrong.

675
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,802
Are you gonna tell him, Doc?

676
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:32,888
Well, I reckon he knows.

677
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:37,859
- Fish...
- Vengeance is hollow, Doc.

678
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,946
Isn't worth a thing.

679
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,200
I think it's time. You
sure you're OK with this?

680
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:47,736
It was always gonna end this way.

681
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,205
I don't want to live, waiting

682
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,241
for either of us to be
shot down by the heir.

683
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,578
That's no life.

684
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,997
So you've made your peace?

685
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:02,167
You're gonna be the one to
break this curse, Wynonna.

686
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,586
For all of us.

687
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:06,588
And I thank you.

688
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:14,646
I'm gonna count to three. OK?

689
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:21,069
One.

690
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:34,166
♪ Don't you cry ♪

691
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:37,336
♪ Go to sleepy ♪

692
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:40,005
♪ Little babies ♪

693
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,624
It's almost time, lovies.

694
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:46,094
Uncle Bobo is finding you. All of you.

695
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,430
And then it will be
just like we planned.

696
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:50,349
All right, that's enough, Constance.

697
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:52,300
Let's not get hysterical.

698
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,470
Let me take them. They'll
be happier with me.

699
00:37:55,522 --> 00:37:58,774
Won't you let me?

700
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,696
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

701
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:06,815
What I would like,

702
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,034
Connie...

703
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:14,039
is for the lead to get
out of this goddamned prison.

704
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:17,376
My lead that you've
been promising me for years.

705
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:23,415
Tit for tat.

706
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,134
Like we've always said.

707
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:32,507
I put your boys back together,

708
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,226
you give me that lead.

709
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,096
By the by.

710
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:40,816
When were you gonna tell me Doc Holliday

711
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,185
was back amongst the living?

712
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,354
When were you gonna tell me

713
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,907
he scares the living shit out of you?

714
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,661
You had no right!

715
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:54,663
I did what was right!

716
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:55,949
Right woulda been shooting that

717
00:38:55,974 --> 00:38:57,224
thing and us running for it!

718
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,749
He wasn't always a thing, Doc.

719
00:38:58,774 --> 00:39:00,142
And if I'm gonna keep killing them

720
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,645
and not go crazy, then
I need more than revenge!

721
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,337
Goddamnit, Wynonna!

722
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:04,120
- They're bad people!
- So I just

723
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:05,427
ignore they're people at all?

724
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:07,959
I spent over a hundred
years in the dark, at the bottom

725
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:10,011
of a dried up old well.

726
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,881
Do you know what thought I turned over

727
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:13,739
and over in my head? What I lived on?

728
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:16,051
The sheer knowledge

729
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,186
that I would pay back the bitch

730
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,639
that made me what I am.

731
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,641
This monster.

732
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,228
- You're not a monster.
- But a lesser man than Fish.

733
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,480
I saw her today.

734
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,866
At least I think I did.

735
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,034
And she...

736
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,371
Her power... I couldn't.

737
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:39,207
That's why you stayed. Not to help us.

738
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,710
I staked that man out there.

739
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:44,629
I knew what would happen to
him and I staked him still.

740
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:47,582
Even worse, I would stake every
Revenant in this world,

741
00:39:47,634 --> 00:39:49,301
and most of the humans too,

742
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:52,337
if that's what it takes to
destroy Constance Clootie.

743
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,674
I need rules, Doc. A code.

744
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:57,843
Otherwise I'll end up just like you.

745
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,638
Oh, stop kidding yourself, Wynonna.

746
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,920
You are exactly like me.

747
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:11,239
We can't.

748
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,658
Shh. Say that after.

757

Please hurry. If Fish screwed me, I'm...

758
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:54,757
Going to realize you shouldn't
have trusted him? Stop hovering.

759
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,675
Or do you want to do this yourself?

760
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:59,144
'Cause this isn't my
vendetta. It's my job.

761
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,146
And I appreciate it.

762
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:03,148
Are we good?

763
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:05,768
Look, I killed three in a day.

764
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,771
Including the one who
helped us get these pictures,

765
00:41:08,823 --> 00:41:11,690
and you know what? He wasn't terrible.

766
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,493
He looked into my eyes,

767
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:17,446
and I offered him a
chance to make peace.

768
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:20,082
And I felt... better.

769
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:22,334
Great plan.

770
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,337
Only thing is, Revenants
don't understand what 'peace' means.

771
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:27,673
Well, maybe only a few take
a shot at coming clean,

772
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:30,960
but I gotta offer it. I
can't fill up on revenge.

773
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:34,179
I need some peace. For me,

774
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:36,715
for my sister.

775
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:39,635
You do it your way, I'll do it mine.

776
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:41,647
As long as we are
pulling in the same direction.

777
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:43,606
Roughly.

778
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:46,692
Take a look.

779
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:04,376
- Can I take this?
- Mm-hmm.

780
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:06,629
As soon as you find a
picture of The Seven...

781
00:42:06,664 --> 00:42:08,797
Yeah, I'll call. Go.

782
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:21,510
I feel like I've seen this before.

783
