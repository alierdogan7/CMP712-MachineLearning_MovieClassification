1
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,513
You, Al, are an object lesson
in the healing powers of obstinacy...

2
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,510
and a hostile disposition.

3
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:42,019
My leg and arm are waxy.

4
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:45,023
How they feel to you
is not the relevant measure.

5
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:48,520
I judge objectively
the way they respond to stimuli...

6
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:51,863
and they are much fucking improved.

7
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:56,162
In the overall, sir, I call you a miracle.

8
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,957
Ready to meet the world.

9
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,263
How much longer you suppose
I'll be buying claims, Mr Wolcott?

10
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:18,556
We're close to the end.

11
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,609
Otherwise, I'll need to start
dancing out here in long johns...

12
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,484
or baying at the moon.

13
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:27,649
Give people some idea of why
I'm going against logic.

14
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,649
This phase is nearly over...

15
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:32,321
even as another begins.

16
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,452
I propose formation of a bank...

17
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:44,083
Mr Star, with yourself as chief officer...

18
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:47,343
my holdings in the camp
standing surety...

19
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:50,213
and Mr Ellsworth as overseer
of my interests.

20
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:51,552
I see.

21
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:54,469
Not quite a rousing endorsement.

22
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:59,433
It's just what's needed, Mrs Garret.
I don't know that I should be part of it.

23
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:04,320
- Why, Mr Star?
- Other obligations.

24
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:06,072
Oughtn't you...

25
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:10,239
or anyone urging such connections
as disqualifying you...

26
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,322
think of the good of the camp?

27
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,039
We all have...

28
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:18,540
complicating obligations.

29
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:52,161
Might those be my new employees?

30
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:58,171
There's a combat in prospect
between those two.

31
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:01,088
As equal as the Sioux with the Whites.

32
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:34,912
All right?

33
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,042
Well, you left upright,
about half a cunt hair.

34
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:40,804
Well, bring me fucking straight then.

35
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,264
I got him, Dan.

36
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,389
Whoa.

37
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:48,471
Right, there you go. Straight as a string.

38
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,939
Stand back then, Johnny.

39
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:52,895
Any drool, first fucking fleck,
you give me this.

40
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,227
You never showed no fucking spittle, Al.

41
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,404
Do as I fucking say.

42
00:04:57,657 --> 00:04:58,986
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,735
I'm going in.

44
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:05,364
Then why am I in first chair?

45
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:09,375
Anyone else suck his prick?

46
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:27,978
You washed your hands of me,
Mr Tolliver...

47
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,308
when I was beset amid that rabble...

48
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:33,736
no less contemptibly
than Pontius Pilate.

49
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:38,735
Sometimes the shadow's cast
by the sheltering hand.

50
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:44,031
Meaning the rabble
was under your control?

51
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:46,249
No, sir. Wouldn't have them.

52
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:50,251
I am attuned, though, to the workings
of what passes for their minds.

53
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,464
This morning we see the result:

54
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:56,420
More claims offered for sale
and prices pressed downward.

55
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:01,429
You suppose the owners fear
you might visit your ire on their titles?

56
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,849
- I want to get out of here.
- I understand.

57
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,279
Will you have a quick wind
of your timepiece before you go?

58
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,360
No. No, sir, I will not.

59
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,611
I feel the earth washing away
from beneath me.

60
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,247
I want to go away.

61
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,498
We'll fucking miss you.

62
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,338
And you, Mr Wolcott, I find you
the most severe disappointment of all.

63
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:32,462
Often to myself as well.

64
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:40,389
What impressions do we expect
he'll take to Yankton?

65
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:43,682
That your money spends...

66
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:46,523
and I'm a dangerous man
with whom to disagree.

67
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:50,613
You put us together, don't that make us
the very image of Mr Hearst...

68
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,405
as he'd want Yankton to think of him?

69
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,664
How's the Jew-fucking going?

70
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,748
It's all right.

71
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,205
What does it add to my understanding?

72
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,872
He's meeting with the widow
this morning.

73
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,259
Spoke to the other of forming a bank,
and of her in that connection.

74
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,101
- Who's the fucking "other"?
- Fucking Bullock.

75
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,938
My sensibilities
do not need coddling, either.

76
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:20,313
It's no concern for you.

77
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,315
I don't like naming the cocksucker.

78
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:27,820
Anyways, that may be its purpose...

79
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,450
his sitting down with the widow.

80
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:33,580
The Jew?

81
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:38,040
I hope you're getting paid for the pussy.

82
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:41,332
Don't put a price to it,
you'll lose their respect.

83
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,341
He's teaching me accounts.

84
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,134
That's all right then.

85
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:47,877
Learning is like currency to them.

86
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:53,977
He stares in my eyes
when he fucks me, longing-like.

87
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:55,897
Jesus Christ.

88
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:01,770
You don't look so bad.

89
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,646
Yeah, next thing to up and about.

90
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,378
Ma'am, may I?

91
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:20,626
A.W. Merrick, ma'am,
of the Black Hills Pioneer...

92
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,876
making bold to introduce himself.

93
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:25,674
I am Mary Stokes, Mr Merrick.

94
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:30,392
I thought so! I hoped so. I'm delighted
to make your acquaintance, ma'am.

95
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,014
And for the camp's children,
whom you will edify.

96
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,360
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

97
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:40,114
And your bags, your bags.
Let's see, are they up here?

98
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:49,827
Liar.

99
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:12,106
- Miss Trixie.
- What is this now?

100
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,683
Nothing nefarious. I was looking for you.

101
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:16,647
My nerves have had a shock.

102
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:20,150
- How so?
- Mrs Garret took poorly.

103
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,319
At the meeting with Mr Star?

104
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:26,995
Come here.

105
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,920
I'll add that...

106
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,801
she hasn't looked well
the last few weeks...

107
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:44,098
especially in the morning. Pale.

108
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:46,346
What are you fucking hinting at?

109
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:47,814
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

110
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:51,979
She ain't looked well mornings
opposed to the rest of the day? Pale?

111
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:58,905
How does sharing observations
make me liable to rebuke?

112
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,911
You got her knocked up, in other words.

113
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:04,491
Me? I ain't got her
in any way at all, Trixie.

114
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,451
In your opinion, I'm saying,
she's in the way.

115
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,579
I work for the woman
in her fucking employ.

116
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,170
I understand that.

117
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,510
And that is the sole
fucking full extent of it.

118
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,639
Would you do the right thing?

119
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:23,894
I was not involved.

120
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,314
We're fucking past that.
I know you weren't fucking involved.

121
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,435
Who was involved, too...

122
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,819
far as that fucking goes?

123
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:34,569
Would you?

124
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,034
Would I fucking what?

125
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:40,953
Do the right fucking thing
in that fucking situation?

126
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,080
What's the situation? Explain it.

127
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,668
If she wanted the child...

128
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:50,754
how a woman wants one that ain't
certain she's made to bear many...

129
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:53,419
willing even to bear it out of wedlock...

130
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:57,262
but for the hurt she'd do another
and the humiliation she'd do...

131
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:02,141
and to that other woman's little boy.
Would you do it then?

132
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:05,765
Do?

133
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:08,779
The right fucking thing.
Don't get fucking coy with me.

134
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:12,322
Marry her, you're saying?

135
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:16,323
And the child in the eyes of others...

136
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:18,955
the issue of my loins.

137
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,784
As much as they care to see.

138
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:24,955
This is only a passing glance.

139
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:30,667
So the cum's true author
ain't thrown in their fucking face.

140
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:37,098
Or the true author's wife's face,
or the face of that little fucking boy.

141
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,351
Well?

142
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,147
Would she fucking have me?

143
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,530
I'd work on that next.

144
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,986
- Books.
- Ah, wonderful.

145
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:55,537
I parted with several boxes in Bismarck.

146
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:58,828
I'm sure to Bismarck's betterment.

147
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,163
Mostly for the sake of the children.

148
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:04,043
The other few, might I suspect...

149
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:07,052
for the sake of certain
childhood memories of your own?

150
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:10,056
You may, and be in the right.

151
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:13,600
When you're situated, Miss Stokes...

152
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:18,013
may I take you on a tour of the camp?

153
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,233
I would be grateful.

154
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:23,612
No more than I, Miss Stokes,
I assure you.

155
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:26,357
Oh, a man's come to camp. Wolcott.

156
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:29,276
Agent for the Hearst's interest.

157
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:34,580
I believe he's made calls
with Tolliver and Yankton.

158
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:37,159
That's why Yankton's
suddenly got balls.

159
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,295
I made him think
I was trying to gull him...

160
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:41,955
and that he had
turned the tables on me.

161
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,466
How much did he buy you for?

162
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,556
I kept Dan apprised
while you convalesced...

163
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,010
in abbreviated fashion.

164
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:52,766
How much?

165
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,558
Oh, $10,000.

166
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,651
Enlisting me, so he thought, to spread
rumours about rescission of the claims.

167
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,025
Tolliver's the front?

168
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,371
Buying from the panicked sellers,
engaged by this Wolcott.

169
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,748
This agent for George Hearst?

170
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,664
That's it in a nutshell.

171
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:26,721
I meant you no disloyalty, Al.

172
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:31,977
You look out for yourself
against the chance I'd die.

173
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,849
I never wished for that outcome.

174
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:38,144
But I am a born follower.

175
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:41,324
In any case, here we are...

176
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:46,494
if tactically disadvantaged,
exactly as before in strength.

177
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,553
Oh, sure. Thank you, sir.

178
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,722
- Morning.
- Morning, Sol.

179
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:14,940
Thanks for opening.

180
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,611
You were out.

181
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,450
Yes. Yes, I paid a call
and then I've been walking.

182
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,461
The call was on Mrs Garret.

183
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:32,038
We agreed that wasn't gonna happen.

184
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:36,084
Our agreement was to not solicit
her investment in a bank.

185
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,348
The call I paid was at her invitation.

186
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:45,470
I don't give a fuck who invited who, Sol.

187
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:46,679
That's your position.

188
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:49,977
Was the bank the subject
of the meeting? Get out!

189
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:53,270
Excuse us a little while, please.

190
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,859
She invited me, Seth.

191
00:14:56,952 --> 00:15:00,487
To talk of forming a bank,
came here and invited you?

192
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,289
Sent Ellsworth that works for her.

193
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,332
You told me none of it.

194
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:07,124
Suspecting maybe
you mightn't act rational.

195
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,123
But I bet you told the whore.

196
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,667
We're done talking about this for now.

197
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,134
- No!
- Yes, Seth.

198
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:16,847
We're done talking about this.

199
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:18,557
If you keep it up, we're going to fight...

200
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:21,051
and you'll have to work by yourself
while I convalesce.

201
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:31,440
Until late, Mr Swearengen,
I was employed by Alma Garret...

202
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,359
as tutor to her orphan ward.

203
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:36,655
- Sacked two days ago.
- Let her tell it.

204
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:38,778
In the course of my employment...

205
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:41,994
I frequently saw Mrs Garret
under the influence of opiates.

206
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:43,580
In this state, she admitted to me...

207
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:45,829
having commissioned
the murder of her husband.

208
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,418
What a world.

209
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,419
She named you as her instrument.

210
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:51,674
Said I killed him?

211
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:54,385
She never specified
you'd actually killed him.

212
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:56,598
- Left it vague-like.
- Exactly.

213
00:15:56,685 --> 00:15:59,722
- That I was her instrument?
- Yes.

214
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:03,859
So we could pin it on someone else,
or I could take the fall, confess...

215
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:06,316
- supporting your version?
- Yes.

216
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,441
In writing
and then subsequently escape.

217
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,742
Such has been known to occur.

218
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:14,746
Leaving the widow lonely
at the bar of justice.

219
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,823
Better one than none at all.

220
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:22,545
- Who do you work for?
- People of means.

221
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,800
People you work for were hired
by people of means.

222
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,336
Don't get cagey, Miss Isringhausen.

223
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:33,054
Let me suggest, Mr Swearengen...

224
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:35,681
you do not get distracted
from your opportunity.

225
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,891
Not who I work for should concern you,
but the amount you'll be paid...

226
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:40,643
and the surety of its delivery.

227
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:41,849
Too fucking true.

228
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:45,777
Why, I pray fervently it ain't
the Pinkertons whose pay you're in...

229
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:49,443
and that her dead husband's people
hired to steal her gold.

230
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:52,865
I got unrelated reasons
to hate those cocksuckers.

231
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:54,487
$50,000.

232
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,075
I'm hard-pressed to think
who the fuck else it would be.

233
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:59,577
$50,000, Mr Swearengen.

234
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,248
Separate from pay to your subordinates.

235
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:04,631
- Your pockets, not mine?
- Yes.

236
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,889
Would it go against his for the pussy?

237
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:10,010
No charge for the pussy.

238
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,641
- Mind if I take the day?
- Not at all.

239
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,351
I've got a lot on my plate just now...

240
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:22,695
and I'm feeling less
than my full fucking self.

241
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:26,066
You seem quite formidable to me.

242
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,237
In any case, I'll wait to hear from Silas.

243
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,077
Do.

244
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,746
That'd be grand.

245
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:48,261
I guess if I called you a cunt,
I needn't expect you to faint?

246
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:50,594
- No.
- Getting struck be a first?

247
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:52,479
How have I injured your interests?

248
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,317
Think he's upstairs considering me
for promotion?

249
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,941
Anyway, clear out of my room.

250
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:01,612
Come up and fuck me, why don't you?

251
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,285
Simple as that? I'd fear a snakebite.

252
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:13,002
Come up and fuck me, and I'll answer
every one you want to ask.

253
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:35,142
Morning, Sheriff.

254
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,412
You sober enough to listen?

255
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,830
Did you just intend to insult me?

256
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,844
- Excuse me, Sheriff.
- I know.

257
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,051
You face business reverses.

258
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,465
Like losing my fucking claim.

259
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,517
People angry at their difficulties
often act like fucking idiots...

260
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:10,390
but there'll be no murdering people
in this camp of any colour...

261
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:12,893
or assaults on officials of any stripe.

262
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:16,689
Even Yankton thieves who are in league
with God knows fucking who?

263
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:20,616
Officials from Yankton or otherwise,
or thieves or not.

264
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:27,743
If you can't live with that,
get out of this fucking camp.

265
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:31,623
I can live with it. You have to keep
rubbing my fucking nose in it?

266
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:38,557
Do not misconduct yourself again
in this camp.

267
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:46,222
Must he take what the Sheriff
just fucking give him?

268
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:48,060
Apparently so.

269
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:52,104
He needn't.
Not by custom, not by fucking law.

270
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:54,443
Name my remedy then.

271
00:19:55,202 --> 00:20:00,244
Outside every county courthouse
in the land is the lady blindfolded.

272
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,910
True, far as it goes.

273
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:08,084
To ignore how them scales she carries
sometimes gets balanced out.

274
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:10,043
There, I take no position.

275
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:12,294
I could take a leather punch...

276
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:15,804
and stab the bastard's horse
in the fucking ass.

277
00:20:15,891 --> 00:20:18,597
You could, and you'd be in the right.

278
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:23,230
Carve on its coat:
"Bullock, I fucked your horse..."

279
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,975
and square the fucking scales.

280
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:29,196
And if the blindfold was down,
see the lady a-winking...

281
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:32,283
while she told you,
you done it like a man.

282
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:35,329
And if I carve "fuck," I will...

283
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:38,363
have fucked the horse beforehand.

284
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:40,620
Preaching to the choir.

285
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,370
- Thanks.
- Sure.

286
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,717
Mingle the shit somewhat.

287
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,509
You ought to take up whittling.

288
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,118
Ready to receive currency, Captain,
in exchange for titles.

289
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,402
Yes.

290
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:16,958
And as I've learned to sustain discourse
while counting...

291
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,212
I'm gonna ask you
to take counsel with me.

292
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,708
In what regard?

293
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:25,298
Well, first, let's agree them
Chink whores make a poor appearance.

294
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:26,501
Yes.

295
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:31,258
And as far as locales for fucking,
them cribs they're in lack allure.

296
00:21:32,143 --> 00:21:34,350
They might attract
the intended clientele.

297
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:37,850
Now, that's an attitude right there
I want us to counsel on.

298
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,434
Smart-alecky sort of attitude...

299
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:45,523
and almost with
a quality of fucking anger to it.

300
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:48,701
I don't find exact fucking words for it...

301
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:51,492
but it fucking disturbs and concerns me.

302
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,871
By my lights, I feel I manage well.

303
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:57,377
Well, you can say that, Mr Wolcott...

304
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,920
yet I hear accounts...

305
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:03,468
that you're a dangerous lay...

306
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:06,848
and that adds to my feeling disturbed.

307
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,804
Are you inclined, sir, every so often...

308
00:22:10,186 --> 00:22:12,095
to ride one off the cliff?

309
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:14,267
Girls, I mean?

310
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,361
I am disturbed at my private conduct
being spoken of.

311
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:20,604
Well, I should think
you fucking would be.

312
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,239
And to think of Mr Hearst's disturbance
if he was to fucking know.

313
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:26,650
Because...

314
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:31,240
that's a dangerous habit to indulge
when you're not among friends.

315
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:33,834
Are you my friend, Mr Tolliver?

316
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:41,084
And someone past surprise at habits
or inclination, or turns of events...

317
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:45,509
and who don't confuse himself
far as sitting in judgement...

318
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,558
with our Lord in fucking Heaven.

319
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:49,228
- I see.
- And...

320
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:53,228
who would never tattle
to your employer...

321
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:57,693
or jeopardise what's got to be
a handsome fucking income.

322
00:22:58,114 --> 00:23:00,950
Goddamn right, I am your friend,
Mr Wolcott.

323
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:04,036
All I can't provide for the party
is the cliff.

324
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:09,459
Believing yourself past surprise does
not commend you to me as a friend.

325
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:13,959
A man inadequately sophisticated...

326
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,466
or merely ignorant, or simply stupid...

327
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:21,047
may believe himself past surprise...

328
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,928
then be surprised to discover,
for example...

329
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:28,637
that Mr Hearst already knows of my
inclinations and finds them immaterial.

330
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:33,357
Suggesting, as a corollary, that your
skills for blackmail and manipulation...

331
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,403
no longer are assets to you...

332
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:40,284
and for your fatuous belief
in their efficacy...

333
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:43,114
in fact, have become liabilities.

334
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:45,705
In short, you've overplayed your hand.

335
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:48,495
Now, I should think in consequence...

336
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,963
now recognising yourself
as a man past his time...

337
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:55,215
that during this last transitional period...

338
00:23:56,555 --> 00:24:00,138
you would devote yourself
with grateful and quiet diligence...

339
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:03,770
to such uses as others
may still find you suitable.

340
00:24:03,855 --> 00:24:07,022
Oh, you bet I'm grateful.
A man like yourself...

341
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:10,481
warmed at Mr Hearst's bosom...

342
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,488
secure in his confidence and trust...

343
00:24:13,574 --> 00:24:17,572
taking the time and spending the energy
to persuade a relic like me.

344
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:31,083
She'd placed adverts for a tutor
in Chicago, Boston and New York.

345
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:33,462
The interests that employ me saw.

346
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,179
- What was you doing at the time?
- Piloting a steamboat.

347
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,175
Was Al right who hired you people
to fuck her up?

348
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,015
That's not something I'm told.

349
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,731
Must be the dead husband's parents...

350
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,024
if they want
to hang that murder off her neck.

351
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,689
That would make sense.

352
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,948
Why does Swearengen hate
the Pinkertons?

353
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,323
Beats me,
a stalwart organisation like that.

354
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:04,001
Did you help send them miners
up the fucking scaffold in Pennsylvania?

355
00:25:04,214 --> 00:25:06,206
I was busy on the Mississip'.

356
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:15,964
Past hope.

357
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,144
Past kindness or consideration.

358
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:23,520
Past justice.

359
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:25,902
Past satisfaction.

360
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,734
Past warmth or cold or comfort.

361
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:36,165
Past love.

362
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:39,711
But past surprise?

363
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:44,251
What an endlessly unfolding tedium
life would then become.

364
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:47,421
No, Doris...

365
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:54,560
we must not let you be past surprise.

366
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:05,611
Carrie's napping. I'll awaken her.

367
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,985
You needn't.
I'd like to see this young lady just now.

368
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:13,450
All right. Doris?

369
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,678
Ah, teachers one remembers.

370
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:33,896
The thrilling kindness
of the extra moment taken...

371
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:36,306
the extra word
of encouragement offered.

372
00:26:36,692 --> 00:26:40,357
"You, young man," or "woman"
as the case might have been...

373
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:43,573
"have an interesting turn of mind."

374
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:48,278
Yes.
And to take that extra moment in turn.

375
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:52,834
Oh, Miss Stokes,
to alter a life's course with a word...

376
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,044
how I revere you...

377
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,422
your profession.

378
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:01,761
- Well, thank you, Mr Merrick.
- No, thank you, Miss Stokes.

379
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:04,087
And all teachers in you.

380
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:10,092
There before you is the Bullock house.

381
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:13,014
It was recently constructed
by Mr Bullock.

382
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,893
These streets.

383
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,361
I got to meet him, Wu.

384
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:20,524
Cocksucker!

385
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,907
San Francisco cocksucker.

386
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:25,408
I have got to meet him.

387
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:28,374
Swearengen,
San Francisco cocksucker meet!

388
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:31,910
San Francisco cocksucker
and Swearengen got to meet.

389
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:36,417
I've got to meet him, Wu.
I've got to see how much juice he's got.

390
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:39,339
Jews?

391
00:27:39,637 --> 00:27:44,051
Yeah, I've got to see how much juice
San Francisco cocksucker's got.

392
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:52,934
Jew? Jew?

393
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:56,646
- No. No, Wu. No Jews.
- Jew?

394
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,234
No Jew. Forget juice.

395
00:27:58,325 --> 00:27:59,653
- Forget juice.
- No Jew?

396
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:00,774
Forget juice.

397
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,906
No, Swearengen.
No San Francisco cocksucker. No Jew.

398
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:06,166
Swearengen, Wu.

399
00:28:07,835 --> 00:28:09,164
Wu and Swearengen.

400
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:20,132
Where are the other girls?

401
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,433
Mooning over a dress at that store.
What is it?

402
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:28,308
He's in a room with Doris.

403
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,105
Wolcott.

404
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,144
- Why is he with Doris?
- I don't know.

405
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:37,028
- Well, why ain't he with Carrie?
- Carrie's napping.

406
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:41,366
I can't imagine...

407
00:28:42,374 --> 00:28:44,450
what Carrie might have told
Wolcott about Doris...

408
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:46,702
to make him want to fuck her.

409
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:50,210
Maybe that she reports to Cy Tolliver?

410
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:53,379
To keep Wolcott from bouncing Doris
off more walls?

411
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,928
Look up from your fucking magazine,
Maddie.

412
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:03,771
I would like to see Carrie now.

413
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,370
Assist me in a flight of fancy,
gentlemen.

414
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:23,409
Well, don't make me
think of Leon in a dress, Mr T.

415
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,084
Or me of him anything but fully clothed.

416
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,051
Mr Merrick appears before you.

417
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:35,304
"Somebody's fucked with
my newspaper office," he says.

418
00:29:35,934 --> 00:29:37,594
"My presses are a mess.

419
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:40,770
"My vowel trays are overturned,"
or the like.

420
00:29:41,065 --> 00:29:43,354
- How do you respond?
- Go fuck yourself.

421
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:44,687
We don't know anything about it.

422
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:47,731
If you ain't here to fuck or be fleeced,
get on your merry way.

423
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:50,064
Good. Now, how about:

424
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:53,824
"Referee's the only neutral
in a prize fight, Merrick...

425
00:29:53,996 --> 00:29:55,656
"and you ain't one of those."

426
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,495
We could say that.

427
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:02,748
What would we mean?

428
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:10,006
I don't know, fellas.
I do not fucking know.

429
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,548
Well, if you don't,
we don't have to, either.

430
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:16,227
I am saying, far as I'm concerned...

431
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:19,349
your initiative and leadership abilities...

432
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:22,857
and stick-fucking-to-it-iveness
are all in fucking question.

433
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:26,483
And was I either or both of you...

434
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,775
I'd consider this a fucking test.

435
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,245
When do you suppose he'll show up?

436
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,244
Once we've paid a visit
to his place, Leon.

437
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,701
Oh.

438
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:45,051
And aftermath,
when Merrick's path crosses ours...

439
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:49,130
he'll hear of the "neutral"
and the "prize fight."

440
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,466
In no uncertain terms.

441
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:54,479
And know the import
of that fucking parable.

442
00:30:56,983 --> 00:30:58,394
All right then.

443
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:00,354
Got any sledgehammers?

444
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:02,686
Always.

445
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:07,067
- I'm going in there.
- No, you aren't.

446
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:12,203
- He ain't the type to be with two women.
- I never took his full history.

447
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,703
I'm saying he ain't.

448
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,706
What are we to do here, Carrie?

449
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:25,847
Get rid of her.

450
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:28,892
They'll let you.

451
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:33,481
I suppose they will,
but that won't dispose of the problem.

452
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:35,775
What's the problem?

453
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:39,070
I don't know.

454
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:41,318
I can't say.

455
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,783
I don't want you to have seen me.

456
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,579
I don't care you killed her.
She must have done something to you.

457
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:54,580
I mean something different.

458
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,459
I don't want to have been seen.

459
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,353
Then you're fucking crazy.

460
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:18,407
And you're going to kill me
in this fucking shithole.

461
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:34,040
Do you know how to make it not hurt?

462
00:32:58,285 --> 00:33:01,286
Now, I could cut off my arm.

463
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:31,852
I'm going in.

464
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:40,163
Your gun isn't there.

465
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,578
I've got it.

466
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,180
Go on, get out!

467
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,449
Miss Stubbs.

468
00:34:20,794 --> 00:34:22,074
Mr Utter.

469
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:34,925
What did you do, Mr W?

470
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:39,186
Something very expensive.

471
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,976
$100,000.

472
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:45,684
For now.

473
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:50,949
And more when I want it
for as many years as I live.

474
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:53,825
For all the years of my life.

475
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:56,248
Do you understand?

476
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:28,024
There's trouble at my place, Cy.

477
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:31,570
Where is Sheriff Bullock
when he's needed?

478
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:36,033
Her last report to you,
did Doris speak of getting beat on?

479
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:40,590
- That's the man making the trouble.
- Don't you fucking follow me.

480
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:47,255
How much money you got, Jack?

481
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:49,385
Don't put me
in the fucking middle, Joanie.

482
00:35:49,476 --> 00:35:51,054
No, I wouldn't.

483
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:53,979
$1,400.

484
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:57,143
Can you run to Mr Utter, Lila,
tell him to ready a wagon.

485
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:58,729
Sure, Joanie.

486
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,149
Go get your fucking money, Jack.

487
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:14,910
Again.

488
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,800
Open the fucking bag for him,
verify it's fucking gold.

489
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,601
I know. I don't want it.

490
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,273
Anyways, good meeting you.

491
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,534
Come on out, Wu.

492
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:55,001
Juice?

493
00:36:56,343 --> 00:37:00,127
If $20,000 don't tempt him to converse,
you're fucking-a-right.

494
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,594
Maybe you and me
should be working for him.

495
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:04,386
Wu, Swearengen.

496
00:37:05,061 --> 00:37:08,097
All right, Wu,
it's been a long fucking day.

497
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:12,224
- No San Francisco cocksucker.
- Come on, Wu, Al's tired.

498
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,531
- Hearst.
- What about him?

499
00:37:28,503 --> 00:37:30,046
San Francisco.

500
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:33,672
You think Hearst
and the Chink's connected?

501
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,219
You think he was born
looking down his nose at $20,000?

502
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:55,949
Chief fact is, no witnesses are extant.

503
00:37:57,035 --> 00:38:01,614
The other madam was here
once when I came out, Joanie Stubbs.

504
00:38:03,376 --> 00:38:06,460
- Before you did this?
- Yes.

505
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:09,328
When I came back out, she was gone.

506
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,541
- Was she ever in the bedroom?
- No.

507
00:38:16,557 --> 00:38:19,345
Don't worry about the other madam.

508
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,354
Go to the hotel.
Eat, if you can stand the food.

509
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:33,858
This will all be took care of.

510
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:39,198
I told you, Mr Wolcott,
all's I can't provide is the cliff.

511
00:38:41,251 --> 00:38:43,410
Go on now, get out of here.

512
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:55,968
I apologise for bringing Trixie into it,
and calling her what I did.

513
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:58,765
That wasn't new information to me.

514
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:07,315
After you and me talked,
I searched that idiot Steve out...

515
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:11,107
to rebuke him and smack him
in the face for being who he was.

516
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:14,276
Sheriff.

517
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,200
Tell me about your meeting
with Mrs Garret.

518
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:22,913
She never once mentioned your name.

519
00:39:23,674 --> 00:39:26,794
She wants to form the bank
to better the camp.

520
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:30,629
- And asked you to be involved?
- To serve as chief officer.

521
00:39:30,723 --> 00:39:32,052
You'd be a good one.

522
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,894
I got the impression
that she might be with child.

523
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:43,644
Lot, before God,
could make no case for that food.

524
00:39:43,905 --> 00:39:45,814
Lot's wife may have been in that food.

525
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:47,816
Over salted as it was.

526
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:51,783
I took that to be your meaning.

527
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:21,571
Shit.

528
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:31,871
Stay still, God damn it.

529
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:37,250
While I come on your fucking leg.

530
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,665
You're lucky I'm not fucking you.

531
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:55,400
You tell the Sheriff
how that fucking felt...

532
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:57,810
me coming on your fucking leg.

533
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:02,855
Or that I saved you from an ass fucking.

534
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:08,612
What else did you learn at that school
that teached you that?

535
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:13,244
Mr Tolliver,
my office has been torn apart.

536
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:16,627
- Hard luck.
- My press has been damaged...

537
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:20,133
my vowel tray beyond repair.
And the newly-arrived schoolteacher...

538
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:23,804
Miss Stokes, has been badly frightened
and has retreated to her hotel.

539
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:25,845
Do we blame unsavoury elements?

540
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:29,636
I regard this incident as postscript...

541
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,938
to the visit
by County Commissioner Jarry.

542
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:33,224
Interesting.

543
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:36,937
Retribution for my refusal to associate
my newspaper...

544
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:40,732
with Yankton's notice
on title to the claims.

545
00:41:40,952 --> 00:41:43,657
For pinning the notice, you mean,
on a wall...

546
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:46,119
instead of printing it
under your masthead?

547
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,367
That is my meaning exactly.

548
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:52,703
Disassociating the Deadwood Pioneer
from what I took to be...

549
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:54,875
the opposite of an effort to inform.

550
00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:58,836
Maybe if you had done your part,
calmed the fucking waters a little...

551
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:00,758
instead of treeing
the county commissioner...

552
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,601
the hooples would have gone
and got their loads on...

553
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,394
and been waiting for your next edition.

554
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,774
No, we differ, Mr Tolliver,
on the function of the press.

555
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:12,944
Ain't the lesson for you in this, Merrick...

556
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:16,814
that with fucked up machinery,
the press cannot function at all?

557
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,827
And is that
the vandalism's purpose, sir?

558
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:24,994
And of the dog defecating in my office...

559
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:30,128
with ruffians dispatched by you
as the lesson's author?

560
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,541
I doubt they had a dog with them.

561
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:39,012
Hostetler, what the hell are you doing?

562
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:45,810
- He was in here fucking a horse.
- I did not fuck that horse.

563
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:51,571
I'm asking you what you're doing.

564
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:55,279
I'm gonna go get a shoeing tool...

565
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:58,121
and I'm gonna hit this bastard
right here...

566
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,785
and I'm gonna drop him
like a piece of beef.

567
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,081
I never fucking harmed you.

568
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:05,454
Guess he ain't talking to me.

569
00:43:05,547 --> 00:43:08,714
I didn't kill you like he's fixing to kill me.

570
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:11,673
You need to die, Steve.

571
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:17,258
Hard as you worked,
as much shit as you had to eat...

572
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:20,011
only way it makes any sense
to kill him...

573
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,803
is if you sign everything you got
across to me first.

574
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,524
'Cause then I could see the logic.

575
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,979
I'm gonna kill him, then I'm fucking
gonna come back and kill you.

576
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,065
And this isn't my will.

577
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,860
Do you believe that God can act
through a nigger?

578
00:43:33,953 --> 00:43:36,279
God does not want you to kill.

579
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,076
Do you believe that God
would let me feel mercy toward you...

580
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:43,455
that tarred me and fucked his horse?

581
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:45,955
I do. But I did not fuck the horse.

582
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,794
Would you go hence in gratitude...

583
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:51,635
if you received mercy in this stable?

584
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:53,135
I would.

585
00:43:54,393 --> 00:43:55,887
Write out...

586
00:43:56,187 --> 00:43:59,473
"I fucked the Sheriff's horse."
Then we gonna have him sign it.

587
00:43:59,565 --> 00:44:02,982
- I didn't fuck the horse.
- "I fucked..."

588
00:44:03,278 --> 00:44:05,187
I jerked off. I came on his leg.

589
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,771
Would you sign off
on that slight exaggeration...

590
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:10,073
to keep from getting your fucking head
smashed in?

591
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:11,323
Yes.

592
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:15,873
Would you bless coloured folk
and God that's father to us all?

593
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:20,660
I would and go hence in gratitude.

594
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:52,166
- Go hence now, Steve, go on.
- Now go.

595
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,414
And if your gratitude ebbs, remember,
we got your signature.

596
00:44:56,546 --> 00:44:58,704
I'll go, and I'll remember.

597
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:10,382
I took a drink of liquor
and it put me to sleep.

598
00:45:10,478 --> 00:45:13,313
How he got in,
how I got beside myself...

599
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:15,522
I ain't took a drink...

600
00:45:16,985 --> 00:45:18,361
in 17 years.

601
00:45:18,987 --> 00:45:22,108
- Yeah, well, you're over that now.
- I don't want any.

602
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:27,074
That tomboy get you that message?

603
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:32,500
I owe you. When they come for you
like they did before...

604
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:36,170
- you would have did like I did.
- Only quicker.

605
00:45:36,716 --> 00:45:40,583
- I appreciated the message.
- So be it henceforth.

606
00:45:45,434 --> 00:45:47,473
Was it a difficult day?

607
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:49,802
No.

608
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:54,349
Mamma met the new schoolteacher
and very much liked her.

609
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:57,317
Mr Merrick brought her to call.

610
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:58,983
Good.

611
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:06,536
I liked her very much.
I'm delighted she's finally arrived.

612
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:08,083
Good.

613
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:21,343
I lack my accustomed stamina.

614
00:46:21,933 --> 00:46:24,424
Bullshit, Doc.
They've been coming at Al in waves...

615
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:25,930
and he stood them all the fuck off.

616
00:46:26,021 --> 00:46:28,060
He'd have stopped Sherman
shy of the sea.

617
00:46:28,148 --> 00:46:31,185
Without the use of a leg, would they
have fired me from a fucking cannon?

618
00:46:31,277 --> 00:46:34,029
Well, I find you in excellent fettle.

619
00:46:34,488 --> 00:46:36,777
Relative to my former wreckage?

620
00:46:36,866 --> 00:46:41,529
Relatively speaking, yes.
All conditions are fucking relative.

621
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:43,330
So how is this?

622
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:48,336
- Relatively speaking?
- Better than this morning.

623
00:46:50,256 --> 00:46:52,582
All right, thanks.

624
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:55,459
Poke a girl before you go, Doc?

625
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:58,303
Well, change off rummaging their twats.

626
00:46:58,557 --> 00:47:02,341
I hope you ain't connected
with them new Chinese prostitutes.

627
00:47:02,478 --> 00:47:06,144
I ain't. But I did try to make friends
with their pimp.

628
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:08,061
Yeah.

629
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,646
- We need to muscle up.
- Local?

630
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:17,239
- Don't know who's been bought.
- Well, send me to Cheyenne.

631
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:20,745
You go. I want you close.

632
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:24,830
I think I'll take a look outside.

633
00:47:26,588 --> 00:47:28,380
What about that forest fucking type...

634
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:30,375
you used to maraud with
before you met me?

635
00:47:30,468 --> 00:47:31,547
Crop Ear?

636
00:47:31,636 --> 00:47:33,296
Yeah, he lacked the use of
a fucking horn.

637
00:47:33,388 --> 00:47:34,847
He ain't available.

638
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,764
Yeah, didn't I hear lately, Dan...

639
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,510
Crop Ear's been
marauding elsewheres?

640
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:39,882
Yep.

641
00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:42,933
Let's not appear
as fucking triplets, huh?

642
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:57,156
Go back down, both of you.

643
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:19,803
Took some fucking portion
of the relative fucking weight.

644
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:27,982
Come on, come on.

645
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:50,803
Someone put a hand out.

646
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:55,846
- Who got it?
- Enid.

647
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:58,975
- Split it three ways, Enid.
- Thanks, Joanie.

648
00:49:06,116 --> 00:49:09,034
- Thank you very much.
- Certainly.

649
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,330
It's $1,400. Split it three ways.
Never come back!
