You'll never catch him.

199
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:58,397
Have you ever wondered why he
doesn't cover up his tracks,

200
00:34:58,398 --> 00:35:05,137
while I'm getting further and
further away from the town,

201
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:09,875

He drew us in.

He was a tall man,
wasn't he?

00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:27,059
I'm gonna have to check
the thickness of his neck.

To make an adequate noose, I have to
take everything into consideration

It will take awhile before you
will take off all the rest.

And my breasts...

will be firm,

278
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:34,173
and my legs, strong.

279
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:39,545
You will kiss my nipples.

280
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:45,284
And my stomach will be hard.

281
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,419
And after...

282
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,790
After, we'll lay down
side by side,

283
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:58,030
and we'll be smoking
our cigarettes.

284

290
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:26,091
And you will feel the taste
of my hair in your mouth.

291
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,763
There will be...

292
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:35,100
plenty of little pale scars
on my stomach.

293
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:39,571
You'll feel them
with your fingers.

294
00:50:39,572 --> 00:50:45,744
I know... you'd like them
to be there.

295
00:50:45,745 --> 00:50:49,982
You will kiss
each one of them...

296
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,718
once.

297
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:59,425

And later...

299
00:51:06,132 --> 00:51:08,801
Later you will
stop being shy,

300
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:11,470
and I will be
kissing you.

00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:17,276

will smell of you.

I could hit you
in the nose.

The bone goes
right into the brain,

313
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:20,439

I dreamed that
I was a bad sheriff,

and that I was drunk.

346
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,692
That every one of my memories
starts with a drink...

347
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:57,062

351
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:24,790

to have a child with a drunk...

that everyone has left me,

01:01:09,102 --> 01:01:14,773

01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:22,534
It said you got
decorated and promoted.

378
01:03:26,706 --> 01:03:29,608
Then I wrote no more letters.

379
01:03:29,609 --> 01:03:32,845
I didn't want the baby anymore.

380
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:43,322
I went down to the stable...

381
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:45,357
with a stick.

382
01:03:47,994 --> 01:03:50,462
I did it by myself.

383
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:56,835
It was laying down there.

384
01:03:56,836 --> 01:04:00,973
There was this
little white dog

385
01:04:00,974 --> 01:04:03,042
which came to me...

386
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:06,512
and started to whimper out loud.

387
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:09,281
It whimpered louder and louder
and wouldn't leave,

388
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:11,884
attracted by the smell of blood.

389
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:17,356
I heard someone coming,
so I grabbed the dog.

390
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:22,461
There will be no life
for me here

391
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:25,664
if they knew that
I've killed the baby.

392
01:04:36,743 --> 01:04:40,746
When I left the stable
that evening...

393
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:47,519
I left two dead bodies behind.

394
01:04:55,962 --> 01:04:59,965
I knew I would be not able
to have children ever again.

395
01:05:16,316 --> 01:05:18,083

Not a profession.

556
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:04,997
A position.

557
01:26:58,051 --> 01:26:59,151
[coughing]

558
01:26:59,152 --> 01:27:00,552
Major.

559
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:04,923
[coughs]

560
01:27:04,924 --> 01:27:06,925
Hard day?

561
01:27:09,162 --> 01:27:10,863
Hard life.

562
01:27:10,864 --> 01:27:12,898
[coughing]

563
01:27:18,738 --> 01:27:20,472
[coughs]

564
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:34,586
[coughing]

565
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:10,356
[wheezing]

566
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:51,430
[grunts]

567
01:28:59,839 --> 01:29:01,740
Could I fix you once more?

568
01:29:03,009 --> 01:29:05,344
No, thanks.

569
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,812
I just had one.

570
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:17,256
Is there any
special way?

571
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:18,691
Oh, no.

572
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:21,894
Whatever you say.

573
01:29:34,674 --> 01:29:36,342
And then?

574
01:29:50,623 --> 01:29:52,257
And then...

575
01:29:52,258 --> 01:29:54,626
we'll live in the...

576
01:29:54,627 --> 01:29:56,195
big city.

577
01:30:13,313 --> 01:30:15,347
Together forever.

578
