The first Colt repeating pistols
  in this territory, sheriff.   

3
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,690
     Finest guns ever made.     

4
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:19,194
Here's law and order            
in six-finger doses, yes, sir.  

5
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,947

as your mother-in-law.

   I'll see that you're on it.

10
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,071

                 about these new

00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,073

               Mr. Farrell.     

12

  You'll hear more.             
  Nothing like 'em.             

13
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,911
              How much more     
        does a man have to hear?

14
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,546

             in this advertising

32
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,169
  Mr. Colt presented me         
     with this pair             

33
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,337

the government in his revolver.

When my outfit was wiped out    
in that ambush,                 

36
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,979
    it was these guns           
   that saved my life.          

37
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,482
Wish I could deliver them       
instead of just take orders,    

38

   but factory's nearly         
      a year behind.            

39
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,936
       No chance of, uh, getting
       a pair soon, Mr. Farrell?

40
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,821
No, not this far west yet.      

41
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,991
Government orders               
have to come first.

as you pour from the flask.

              SHERIFF:          
     Six shots instead of one.  
   Man, that makes a difference.

44
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:47,632
In your business it does.       

45
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,300
And I'm not covering            
the general trade               

46
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,469

in my territory gets            

47
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,237
his order in first.

Just crimp in the bullets,      

49
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,159
no wadding is necessary,        

50
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,994
and the rammer tempts them home.

51
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,964
   Six shots instead of one.    

52
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,467
            Farrell,            
   you really got somethin'.    

53

      of them revolvers,

       keep 'em on ice overnight

59
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,184
               and then ship 'em
                  out of town.  

60
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:24,953
        Keeps the streets clean.

Every man to his business,

        yellow as a whining pup.

without a gun in his fist.

                    Oh, no.

Come on, spit it out.           

248
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,041

that you or your wife           

249

out on me.

              along with you    

252

    of mine over for a hangout,

   risks that you don't need to.

Like me before I figured it out.

259
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,866
   Because there's a mining boom
              going on

261
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,005
I figure there should have been 
about $10,000 in gold           

262
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,606

              more equipment.   

266

        the saloons, the banks.

              to the bank?
