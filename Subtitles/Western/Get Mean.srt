(snorting )

3
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,893
(faint heartbeat thumps)

00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,117
Ti

00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,297
(screaming )

00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,016
(scream echoing)

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,978

00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,247
(whinnying continues)

11
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,954
(bell ringing)

12
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,267
( coughing )

13
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,922
(wood creaking)

14
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,512
Woman:
We have been expecting you.

15
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,574
Please, sit down.

16
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,594
Man:
Eat.

17
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,143
Man:
That's $10,000.

18
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,442
- Whose is it?
- For you.

19
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,076
Me?

20
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,038
(Wry chuckle)

21
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,798
Our land has been conquered
by a barbaric race.

22
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,084
We would like you to escort
the present heirto the throne

23
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,379
back to our people in Spain
so she can help to lead the army

24
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,422
and overthrow the barbarians.

25
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,140
For many years, a great number
of poor people has sacrificed

26
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,932
to collect this money.

27
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,771
- For what?
- Woman: For me.

28
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,279
I have the great honor to present
Princess Elizabeth Maria de Borgos...

29
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,494
direct descendant
of one of our most noble families.

30
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:27,753
And we're willing to pay any amount
for her safe conduct to Spain.

31
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,710
Well, I don't know who you are,

32
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,301
and I don't know nothin'
about no barbarians.

33
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,219
Hell, I don't even know where
this place Spain is you're talkin' about.

34
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,763
But I'll tell you one thing <i>--</i>

35
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,977
- You raise this pot here...
- ( coins rattling)

36
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,986
to $50,000 gold,

37
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,990
lady, I'll take you any goddamn place
you want to go.

38
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,197
Is that the kind of respect
you show for royalty?

39
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,334
Look...

40
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,837
business is business,

41
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,717
and I happen to be
a businessman.

42
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,468
And besides,

43
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,721
if I really thought
you were a princess,

44
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,224
well, I'd ask for $100,000.

45
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,929
(clattering)

46
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,850
(woman screaming)

47
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,023
(screaming )
Let me go!

48
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,987
(screaming continues)

49
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,652
Where is the girl?

50
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,617
Leave him alone!
He knows nothing!

51
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,781
Where is she?

52
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,950
( Old woman struggling,
screaming )

53
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,119
Let me go!

54
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,163
(screaming )

55
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,380
What the hell is that
supposed to be? Mm!

56
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,179
Excuse me, pal.

57
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,185
This belongs to me.

58
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,774
( Chuckles)

59
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,482

(train whistle blares)

62
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,893
- What's that?
- It was built by the Moors

63
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,895
when they came here
years ago

64
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,933
to help my people
conquer the barbarians.

65
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,978
In this place, they once kept
the treasure of Rodrigo.

66
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,523
- The what?
- The treasure of Rodrigo.

67
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,844
(thundering hoof beats)

68
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,700
(exhales sharply)

69
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,465
Who's that?

70
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,725
Our enemies, the barbarians.

71
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,227
What about them?

72
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,764
- The Moors.
- The what?

73
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,979
- The Moors.
- Now, lady,

74
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:46,568
them people are fixin' to "fonch"
upon one another.

75
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,482
Best we get the hell
out of here.

76
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,276
Get your stuff.

77
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,905
Them's the barbarians, right?

78
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,625
And them's the Moors, right?

79
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,039
Yes.

80
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,050
(exhales sharply)

81
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,466
Now, this is a dangerous country.

82
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,181
They're fightin' everywhere.
Let's go. Come on.

83
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,095
Come on!

84
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,809
Wait!

85
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:48,398
That's the Moorish army.
They've come to help my people.

86
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,154
- You must do something!
- What do you want me to do?

87
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,566
I command you to help my army!

88
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,905
And I command you
to shut up, lady,

89
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,537
because you're gettin'
on my nerves.

90
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,850

108
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,973
Let's go!

109
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,496
You butchers!
You pigs!

110
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,003
You stupid woman!

111
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,415
You don't understand
who you're speaking to!

112
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,256
No, you are the one
who doesn't understand.

113
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,513
I am a princess,
Elizabeth Maria de Borgos.

114
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,014
( Groans)

115
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,016
Let me welcome you to Spain

116
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,982
and offer you the hospitality
of my humble house.

117
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,273
I accept nothing
that is already mine.

118
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,533
I am the rightful ruler
of this land.

119
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,286
You own nothing
but the army of that man!

120
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,742
Look.

121
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,380
This little woman here
fell off her horse

122
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,712
a few days back
and hurt her head.

123
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,344
Now she's crazy.

124
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,893
Ah, come on, you guys.

125
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,180
If you really think
she's a princess,

126
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,440
you're all crazy.

127
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,478
She's not a princess,
she's an ill-bred bitch!

128
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,941
Just hold on there.

129
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,948
I'm supposed to get $50,000

130
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,737
for delivering her,
whatever she is.

131
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,745
How much is that?

132
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:01,159
It would buy you 2,000 horses.

133
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,669
Stupid foreigners.

134
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,798
You <i>come</i> to my country,
and you insult me.

135
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,709
- I kill you both!
- Diego!

(sword scrapes)

137
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,548
If I've told you once,

138
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,514
I've told you a hundred times <i>--</i>

139
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:24,228
You must never lose control
in front of the men.

140
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,020
Diego, hang him.

141
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,945
By his feet.

(laughing continues)

148
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,901
Now, let's talk this thing over.

149
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,937
We can make a deal.

150
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,607
Hell, <i>I'll</i> take $25,000.

151
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:15,946
Hang him!

153
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,784
Hey, come back here!
Where are you going?

154
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,297
Where are you going,
you bunch of foreigners?

155
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,755
You can't treat a man like this!

156
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,636
Hey! Cut me down!

157
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,299

I'm gonna get you!

160
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,682
I'll kill you!

(faint shouting)

162
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,896
'Cause I ain't leaving this country

Listen, ask him
about my money, will ya?

186
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,142
There's no way to pay you

187
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,148
until Rodrigo's treasure
has been found.

188
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,561
Look, lady, a deal's a deal.

189
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,025
I was supposed to bring her to you,
and I did,

190
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,566
and now I want my $50,000.

Please, tell us
the secret of the treasure.

194
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,797
The princess...

195
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,587
is the only one
who can claim the treasure.

196
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,178

Please, Emir, we have to know.

197
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,685
You are dying.

The what?

207
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,550
It's a temple in the mountains.

208
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,427
Oh, dear God,

This is the Ancient Fortress

I pay $50,000 for the princess!

279
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,250

we had a little talk.

Have you ever read Shakespeare?

- Who?

No, I don't suppose
you would know him.

292

( Chuckles )
Shakespeare.

293
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,566
He wrote a great many plays--

294
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,353
Hamlet, Othello, Richard III.

295
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,238
( Chuckles )
Dear Richard.

296
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,401
Richard was
a very interesting man.

297
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,740
He was a hunchback.

298
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,825
You might say...

299
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,706

300
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,369
he is my idol.

301
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,162
All right, Richard.

00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,922
(women giggling, exclaiming)

303
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,905
Well, thank you.

304
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,755
Oh, you son of a gun!

305
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,214
But how do you pick one of them?

306
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,048
Oh, they're not for me.

307
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:21,638
( Chuckles )
They're for them.

308
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,518
Mm-hmm!

309
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:33,107
But don't they get nervous
with those guys watching up there?

310
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:37,240
No, no. Those guys are blind.

311
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,526

This guy's a cripple.

312
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,490
A hunchback.

313
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,954
And he's crazy.
Completely crazy.

314
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,914
But he must be doing
something right.

315
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,249
Damn.

316
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,049
I've been trying to make a deal
with the wrong guy.

317
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:59,759
Tell me, do you like
what you have seen?

318
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,969
Are you kiddin', Richard?

319
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,135
I've been waitin' all my life
for somethin' like that.

320
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,555
Well, perhaps I can arrange
for you to have it.

00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,893

Now perhaps we can reach some...

325
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,084
agreement between us.

326
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,003

327
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,171
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

328
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:48,266
What about Diego?
Where does he fit into this thing?

329
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,977
Never mind about Diego.

00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,484
This is between you and I.

I'm sorry. This is one
of our most sacred traditions.

367
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,849
The princess will not be able
to claim the treasure

368
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,985
unless she makes the long journey
through the trials of death.

369
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,738
- The what?
- Man: The trials of death,

370
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:13,447
a venture full of magic
and the unknown.

371
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:18,160
They are the only way
to claim Rodrigo's treasure.

372
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,825
After many men had died
in the attempt,

373
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,165
a time came when
no one else would try.

374
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,501
So the tradition and the secret
of the treasure

375
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,042
were lost and forgotten.

376
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,676
Man:
Now, mister, you're crazy.

377
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,805
We got a little woman here.

378
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:37,888
Now, if all them guys got killed tryin',
how do you expect her to do it?

379
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,768
She doesn't have to.

380
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,272
If the heir apparent
is a woman or a child,

381
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,184
a loyal subject
who must carry no weapon

382
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,977
may be appointed instead.

383
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,614
But she insists on going.

384
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:58,743
I'm going,
and nobody can stop me.

385
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,077
<i>Lady...</i>

386
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,121
I'll not only stop you,

387
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:11,964
but I'll break
your goddamn legs for you.

388
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,380
Now, we got a problem here.

389
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:20,347
We got a serious problem here.

390
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,888
All right, what are we gonna do
about this thing?

391
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:28,526
Well, I could certainly do
this kind of thing better than you.

392
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,482
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

393
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:34,195
However, there is
one small problem.

394
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,859
What's that?

395
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:38,995
Well, you know how it is
when one's crippled.

396
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:45,035
You'll have some good days...
and some bad.

397
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,296
And today is just one of those
bad days, right?

398
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,922
Ah.

399
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,136
You know, I'm really happy
you came along, partner.

400
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,720
That's very nice
of you to say.

401
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,805
All right, what do I have to do?

402
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,269
(bell tolling)

403
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,072
(tolling stops)

404
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,695
(explosion )

405
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,697
(steam hissing )

406
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,359
( gasping )

407
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,707
(coughing, choking)

408
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,085
(voice howling)

409
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,790

( howling )

413
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,097
(exclamations, grunts echoing)

414
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,319
(mournful howling)

415
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,202
(voice laughing)

416
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,741
- ( voices laughing )
- ( whipping )

417
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,875

(whipping )

420
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,803
( howling )

421
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,768
(howling fades)

422
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,353
(coughing, sobbing)

423
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,026
( howling )

424
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,988
(female voice laughing)

425
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:34,207
(voices laughing)

426
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,340
Now, all you people
in them coffins,

427
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,844
I don't believe
in this kind of stuff.

428
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,846
You hear me?

429
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,851
So don't be trying to turn me
into no damn wolf.

430
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,977
( Howling )

431
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,435
-( howl echoing)
- ( voices laughing)

432
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,165
(screaming )

433
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,328
(scream continues)

434
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,167
(scream echoing)

435
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,362
Hey!
( echoing )

436
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,325
Anybody home?
( echoing )

437
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,869
(explosion )

438
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,831
( coughing )

439
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,086
Oh!

440
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,753
Oh, my God, I'm black!
I'm dyin'!

441
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,981
( Roaring )

442
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,238
( mooing )

443
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,702
(low growling)

444
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,177
(snorting )

(shout echoing)

448
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:17,954
Now, what the hell
kind of treasure is that?

449
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:21,662
Maybe it's old or something.

450
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:23,451
(screaming )

451
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,914
(screaming echoing)

452
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,639
( man groans)

453
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,569
(shuddering)

454
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,416
- What happened?
- ( groaning )

455
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,634
Tell me what happened in here.

456
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,466
They...
(groans)

457
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,845
(doors opening)

458
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,999
There. You see?

459
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,836
I told you.
They plotted together.

460
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,592
Where is my treasure?

461
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,549
( Chuckles)

462
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:02,182
But, mister,

463
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,265
now you've got to
get me a doctor,

464
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,897
because I've turned black all over,
and I think I'm gonna die.

465
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,308
Search him!

466
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,459
- ( Man gasps )
- ( people shrieking )

467
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:32,371
Oh, my God!
Zepeda's necklace!

468
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,041
- The Scorpion's Sting.
- Man: The what?

469
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,084
It's called the Scorpion's Sting.

470
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:41,097
Death comes to whoever claims it.
They say El Cid had it at Valencia.

471
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,553
Three days later...

472
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,217
he was dead!

473
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:49,059
Shut up!
Give it to him!

474
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,019
( Gasping )

475
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,403
T-Take it.

476
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,405
Take it.

477
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:02,068
You take it, or I'll drive this dagger
through your black throat.

478
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,987
All right.

479
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,951
<i>I'll take it.</i>

480
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,458
Hell, that's a nice necklace.

481
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,502
(exclaims)

482
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:20,674
- ( Sombra laughing )
- What?

483
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,088
Nothing.
( chuckles )

484
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:25,303
- It was nothing.
- Why do you laugh?

485
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,184
Please, Diego.

486
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,437
In another moment,
you'll lose your temper and he'll be dead,

487
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,439
and then you'll never
find your treasure.

488
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,943
Don't listen! Don't listen.
He tried to betray you.

489
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,853
That's right, Diego.
Listen to

490
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,819
<i>H </i>

491
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,779
Our little butterfly,

492
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,366
who'd sell his mother for the price
of a new hat with feathers!

493
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,030
Now, come.

494
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:51,621
Come, sweet counselor.
Tell us.

495
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,287
If I did betray Diego for the treasure,
where is it?!

496
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:57,377
I...

497
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:03,299
I d-- I don't know.

498
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:07,057
That's right.
You don't know, do you?

499
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,309
(Sombra cackles)

500
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,891
You think that
Diego is a fool,

501
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,148
that you can whisper anything
that you like into his ears

502
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:19,187
and he will believe you <i>--</i>
well, you're wrong!

503
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,323
Diego knows better than that.

504
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:26,076
He knows that if I had this treasure
in my hands, I would bring it to him!

505
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,283
- Bullshit.
- ( exclaims )

506
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,245
(bells jangling)

507
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,800
We will dedicate

508
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,178
this human sacrifice

509
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,179
in memory of Rodrigo!

510

(men chuckling)

514
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:53,391
There's no real reason for you
to share the same fate as your friend.

515
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:57,098
- Just tell me where the treasure is.
- ( spits )

516
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,104
Bring me swords!

517
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:13,619
If you won't tell me, then take
your secret to the grave with you.

518
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,168
Take up the sword

519
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,671
or take up me.

520
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,711
(grunting)

Well, come on!

523
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,777
I'm begging to be killed!

( Groans)

525
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,110
Well, it looks like
I drew first blood.

526
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,449
(shouting )

527
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,747
- Why, hello.
- ( yells )

528
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:09,541
(laughing, grunting)

529
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:15,090
It's a shame to waste
a beautiful woman like you.

530
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,723
( laughing )

01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,018
- ( exclaims )

532
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:38,112
All right.
Everybody go out.

533

Everybody go out!

(man groaning)

538
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:35,340
Oh, I'm glad I didn't shoot
you two bastards.

539
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:39,006
- It would've been too quick.
- ( wry chuckle)

540
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,641
Hold your head up high!

541
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,973
You're the guest of honor

542
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,263
at our feast tonight!

( Chuckles)

544
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,315
You see, partner,

545
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,900
the flames are very low,

01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:38,913
Oh, my God!

730
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:41,173
It's Rodrigo's treasure!

731
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:42,674
Sombra:
Shh!

732
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:45,006
It's been right here
under our noses all the time.

733
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:46,842
Of course. Of course!

734
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,598
Here, in Rodrigo's ancient fortress.

735
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:53,260
Wait! Listen to me!

736
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:56,681
This is madness,
trying to kill each other.

737
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,270
There's a fortune here!

738
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:03,028
Let's come to some agreement.
Let's-— let's make a deal!

739
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:05,531
Man:
All right.

740
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,193
But first, let the princess go.
(voice echoing )

741
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,862
He must be here.
Go get him. Kill him!

742
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:13,531
L": _, ljfl Iii ;:- : :".__z;_:-_;;:# j']_'

743
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:17,292
You want to share in this treasure,
you'll do as I say. Now, go on!

744
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,713
( Chuckles)

745
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,168
(door creaking)

746
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:37,058
Ha!
( cackling )

747
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:40,065
When the butterfly goes
too nearthe flames...

748
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:42,647
Alfonso: Sombra, he's not in here.
Why did you lock the door?

749
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:46,063
( Cackling )
...he gets burned!

750
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,484
- Alfonso: No, Sombra. Sombra!
-( knocking on door)

751
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,403
Sombra, let me out.
Let me out!

752
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:55,368
Oh! Oh, <i>my</i> God!

753
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,913
No!
( screaming )

754
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,751
Let me out! Let me out!

755
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,507
If“ I?

756
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,009
No! No!

757
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,589
Som bra!
( screaming )

758
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,177
No!

759
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:16,893
(explosion )

760
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:20,521
(gasps)

761
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,947
No!

762
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:38,787
(screaming )

763
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:50,294
( groans)

764
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,450
( groans)

765
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:26,547
Now, that's one hell of a way
to treat a princess, ain't it'?

766
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:31,964
You okay?

767
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,758
Wait for me inside, all right?

768
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:45,728
( Groaning )

769
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,451
My leg.

770
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:57,953
My leg!

771
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:03,416
Oh, please, let me go.

772
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:07,375
I couldn't sleep nights
if I let you go.

773
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,462
Only... give me a chance.

774
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:15,220
Just... give me a chance.

775
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,303
I'll give you a chance.

776
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,269
Just like you gave
that little gypsy girl.

777
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,600
(whimpering gasps)

778
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:26,982
Get up. Get up!

779
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,440
How dare you talk
to me like that?

780
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,064
You think I'm just another
pitiful hunchback

781
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,108
limping my way through life!

782
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:40,404
No, no. Don't be fooled
by my appearance.

783
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,823
I am Richard!

784
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:45,833
Richard, king of all of England!

785
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:49,997
- Okay, Richard!
- ( groaning )

786
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,257
If you're a king,

787
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,420
you'll understand this real good.

788
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:58,589
I challenge you to a duel.

789
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:02,430
You got your cannon,

790
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:04,310
I got mine.

791
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:06,517
- Huh?
- Now, you go for it.

792
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,149
I said, go for it!

793
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,161
Now is the winter of our discontent,

794
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:29,123
made glorious summer
by this son of York.

795
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:31,380
And all the clouds
that lowered upon this house

796
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:35,133
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried!
(cackles)

797
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,717
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths,

798
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:42,053
our bruised arms
hung up for monuments,

799
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:44,809
our stern alarums
changed to merry meetings,

800
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,812
our dreadful marches
to delightful measures.

801
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:49,814
- I.'f:Lj« Hi IT 'i /1 ? --'=;..:7 I: :352::~.~::1 :;:':,ll::jl 'i;"f§ I <i>_</i> I;-1

802
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:53,147

803
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,108
(exclaims)

804
01:27:57,314 --> 01:28:00,488
( cackling )
Deformed,

805
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:05,156
unfinished...
(exclaims)

806
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:09,247
...sent before my time
into this breathing world,

807
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:12,834
scarce half made up,
and that so lamely and unfashionable

808
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:16,546
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them!

809
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:19,006
(shouts)

810
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:22,264
A horse! A horse!

811
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,594
My-H

812
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,010
- ( shouting )
- ( gunfire continues)

813
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,519
( groaning )

814
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:35,519
A horse...

815
01:28:35,685 --> 01:28:36,732
( groans)

816
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:43,406
( spurs jangling )

817
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:49,704
The king is dead.

818
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:54,625
Long live the king.

819
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,716
Or whatever they say.

820
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:03,054
(explosion )

821
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:01,397
(train whistle blowing)
