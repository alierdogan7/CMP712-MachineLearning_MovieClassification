00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,540
SHANSSEY: Hello, Ed.
- Where's Doc Holliday?

2
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,125
SHANSSEY: Over at the hotel.
He's been expecting you...

3
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,336
Get word over there
I'm waiting for him.

4
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,470
No need to do that, Ed. The whole town
knows you're waiting for him by now.

5
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,856
Before there's
another killing...

6
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:59,794
Just go on serving your
watered-down liquor.

7
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,425
And keep out of my
business, Shanssey.

8
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,435
SHANSSEY: Your brother came in here
stinking drunk, spoiling for a fight.

9
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,643
- Whiskey. Over there.
SHANSSEY: He drew a gun on Holliday.

10
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,815
Have it your way, Ed.

11
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,151
Check your guns if
you wanna stay here.

12
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,042
Leave the bottle.

13
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,093
You don't stand a chance, Doc.

14
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,925
Bailey brought two men with him.

15
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,637
Oh, come on, honey. Let's cut out
of here while there's still time.

16
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,895
The whole town, including that
no-good marshal, is laying for you.

17
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,569
Right or wrong, they're gonna hang you
for another killing. You know it.

18
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,816
Doc.

19
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,241
Oh, you ain't even listening to me.

20
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,779
Now, Kate, Mr. Bailey came all
the way from Fort Worth...

21
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,743
...to see me on a
gentleman's matter.

22
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,953
A gentleman. Hmph.

23
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,743
It wouldn't be hospitable for me
to leave town, now, would it?

24
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,083
Don't start that gentleman
business with me again.

25
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,339
It was a pure case
of ethics, but...

(CHUCKLES)

27
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,424
Well, that's something a person
like you wouldn't understand.

28
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,594
Why do you always have to
treat me like I'm dirt?

29
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,509
You ain't no better than me.

30
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,645
- That's debatable.
- Oh, is it?

31
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,398
You and that magnolia dripping.

32
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,354
Let me tell you something,
Doc Holliday.

33
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,237
All them fancy clothes and that smart
talk don't make you no gentleman.

34
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,444
You are dirt, just like me...

35
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,032
...and I'm tired of hearing about
that Georgia plantation...

36
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,196
...and all them lily-white
friends of yours.

37
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,708
They're all gone now.
They're all gone!

38
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,459
Yes, they are.

39
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,624
Here I am with you.

40
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,923
Your family scraped the barrel
after the war wiped them out...

41
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,804
...just to send you through
dental school. Heh.

42
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,840
You sure turned out fine.

43
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,600

Maybe we could even go to
Laredo like you said...

53
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,506
...and do something about
that cough of yours.

54
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,920
It's getting worse all the time.

55
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,090
Your concern over my
health touches me deeply.

56
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,929
You know how I feel about you.

57
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,968
I know exactly how you feel.

58

anything happened to you.

You'd lose your meal ticket,
wouldn't you?

61
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,483
That ain't nice to say to me, Doc.

62
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,868
I been good to you, ain't I?

63
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,114
Why don't you think about
me once in a while?

64
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,667
All right, get over to Shanssey's
and tell them I'll be there later.

65

Why didn't you hold him?

78
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,403
I have no quarrel with Ike Clanton.
Nothing to hold him for.

79
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,691
Nothing to hold him for?

80
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,281
Why, man, he's got a dozen
charges against him.

81
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,117
I played this whole thing so
he'd be forced into Griffin.

82
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,284
I figured if there was one man in Texas
who could stop him, you'd be the man.

...and knock out three of the
fastest guns in the territory.

Wilson had gone yellow...

...I'd call him a liar.

in a place like this?

Can't do that, Wyatt. There's
no law against women gambling.

for $10,000 anywhere in the West.

- You're talking to a lady.

It appears the marshal
hasn't met a lady before.

You're in a saloon
playing a man's game.

01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,103
I'll work beside you in the fields.

839
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:06,312
But you've got to meet me halfway.

840
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,828
I must go to Tombstone.

841
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:31,667
All right, go. Clean up Tombstone.

842
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,881

Tombstones on the frontier...

843

all waiting for the
great Wyatt Earp.

844
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,095
Go on. Clean them all up.

845
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,143
Go on!

846
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,729

I love you, Wyatt.

848
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,770
Good afternoon, marshal.
Out for a little ride?

849
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,904
About 700 miles' worth. Tombstone.

850
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,111
Tombstone, huh?
I'm heading that way myself.

851
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:22,072
I understand the climate down
there may be better for my cough.

852
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,488
Since when have you gotten
interested in your health?

853
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,373
Well, it's really a matter of finances.
The deck's gone cold here.

854
01:10:27,432 --> 01:10:29,910
Nobody will give me any play.

855
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,994
Mind if I ride along?

856
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,297
It's a free country. Hop on.

857
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,541
Where's your gear?

858
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:52,041
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

859
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:59,874
Well, thanks for the ride.

you away from Virgil.

867

be the only single one left.

868
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,369
I got a family going in Deadwood.

869
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,407
Even little Jimmy here's tying the
knot when he gets back to California.

870

It's your bedtime now.

Aw, Mom, do I have to?

878
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,983
Yes, you do. Your uncles
will all be here tomorrow.

879
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,564
TOMMY: Good night, Uncle Wyatt.
- Good night, Tommy.

880
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,900
TOMMY: Good night, Uncle Morgan.
- Good night, son.

- Good night, Uncle James.
JIMMY: Good night, Tommy.

882
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,405
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, son.

883
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,865
It's nice to have you here.

884
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,790
I only wish it were under
happier circumstances.

885

She seems pretty upset.

886
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:32,183
Well, she's been after me for
a year to quit marshaling.

887
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,389
You know how women are.

888
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,435
All right. Now, let's get
down to business.

889
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,146
Now, Morgan and Jimmy
know the setup here.

890
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,482
Now, Wyatt, you know Ike Clanton
has a ranch outside city limits.

891
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:45,737
Yes, I know.

892
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,821
He's organized the toughest bunch
of gunslingers you ever laid eyes on.

893
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,201
He owns the county sheriff.

894
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,704
- Who is he?
- Cotton Wilson.

895
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,366
Cotton Wilson.
So Ike paid off on his deal.

896
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,786
Clanton's been rustling Mexican
cattle by the thousands.

897
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,579
And he has to move them.

898
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,760
He can only ship them
out of Tombstone,

899
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:06,322
and he can't do that while
we control the city.

900
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,585
That's about it.

901
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,754
He's organized, and he's mean.

902
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,797
We can't keep him out
of Tombstone forever.

903
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:13,620
What about the
people of Tombstone?

904
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,510
John Clum, editor of the <i>Epitaph...</i>

905
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:19,977
and some of the leading citizens will back
us if they know you're calling the shots.

906
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,609
We're all agreed, Wyatt.
You should run the show.

907
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,905
There's only one thing
that bothers me...

908
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,537
...and I wanna speak my piece now.

909
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:39,534
There's gonna be a lot of bad talk
about you riding with Doc Holliday.

910
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,789
What about Holliday?

911
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:45,252
MORGAN: He's the worst killer on the
frontier, that's what about him.

912
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,509
It just don't look good,
you coming here with him.

913
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:52,968
Holliday saved my life in Dodge City.
I don't forget that.

914
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,303
What's more,
he's a man of his word.

915
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,094
As long as he plays his cards
straight and keeps out of killings...

916
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,513
...we got no right to
run him out of town.

917
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,382
I didn't know you
two were a team.

918
01:15:02,408 --> 01:15:04,880
We're not. It's just
a case of square deal.

919
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,815
Holliday stays.

920
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,823
All right, Wyatt.
He's your responsibility.

921
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,234
That suits me fine. Do we
have a map of the county?

922
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,479
The first thing we
gotta do is let the

923
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:18,978
Clantons know that the
city is closed to them.

924
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,369
Then we gotta control the county.
Now, that's important.

925
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,192
I'm gonna get a letter
off to a man tonight

926
01:15:24,218 --> 01:15:25,814
who'll take care of
that matter for us.

927
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,878
- Now show me where the Clanton ranch is.
- Here.

928
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,257
Where does he keep his men?

929

Hello, Cotton.
I've been expecting you.

01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:44,606
You're looking fine,
real prosperous.

931
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,564
- Oh, I ain't complaining.
- What's on your mind?

932
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:51,776
Wyatt, Ike wants to make you a deal.
He promises no trouble...

933
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:53,941
...if you let him ship his
cattle out of Tombstone.

934
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:57,032
- Well, that's mighty nice of Ike.
- Ike's a nice fella.

935
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,698
He's got a fortune tied up in
cattle out there at the ranch...

936
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:03,789
...and he's gonna move them.
- Oh, he is, huh?

937
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,879
There's $20,000 in
it for you, cash.

938
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,723
Twenty thousand dollars?

939

The wages of sin are rising.

940
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,728
Twenty thousand against
a 6-foot hole in Boot Hill...

941
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:26,562
...or a $20-a-month pension if you
live long enough to collect it.

942
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,607
I've thought about those things.

944
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:47,044
...this is a nice little town,
a good place to set a while.

945
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,789
I might even run for county
sheriff in a couple of months.

946

That don't scare me at all.
I got mine.

947

the bank, and you know something?

not one bit.

01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,604
I said I'd see you dead.

1007
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:19,016
(CROWD MURMURING)

1008
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:40,079
What kind of a sucker play is this?
It's all Clanton needs to start a war.

1009
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:44,250
I've had it up to here. You wanna
play patty-cake with them, go ahead.

1010
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,841
Give me your gun, Doc.
You've got no right packing it.

1011
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:55,140
Now, you can...

1012
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:59,231
You can thank God you're
Wyatt Earp's brother.

1013
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:04,316
Holliday, if you think anything about
Wyatt, you'll get out of here.

1014
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:08,111
Having a killer like you around is the
worst thing that can happen to him.

1015
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,348
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1016
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:01,414
- I hear you're leaving Tombstone.
- You hear good.

1017
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,830
I'm taking the stage tomorrow.

1018
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,586
I thought this climate
was good for your cough.

1019
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,220
Listen, preacher...

1020
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:15,303
...being here's caused me
a lot of embarrassment.

1021
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:18,594
Some people are even
taking me as a lawman.

1022
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,356
You're not leaving on my account?

1023
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,646
Your account?

1024
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:28,108
You got nothing to
do with my leaving.

1025
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,867
WYATT: Good luck, Doc.

1026
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,219
Too bad we won't be in
on the finish together.

1027
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,051
JOHN: Hi, Wyatt.

1028
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:09,799
Here's that letter
you've been waiting for.

1029
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,418
What have we got here?

1030
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,955
Young Clanton passed out
drunk at the Alhambra.

1031
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,795
Throw him in the tank.
Let him sleep it off.

1032
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,504
WYATT: Hold it a minute.

1033
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:36,884
John, how long is it gonna take
to get those men you promised?

1034
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,890
Any time you say.

1035
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:41,310
I think I'll take a trip
out to the Clanton ranch.

1036
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:43,220
- Are you crazy?
- I don't think so.

1037
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:46,891
VIRGIL: Take your gun.
- This is all the ammunition I'll need.

1038
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,197
If I'm not back in a
couple hours, Virge...

1039
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:57,485
...have Clum's citizens'
committee drag my carcass out.

1040
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:16,003
Whoa, whoa.

1041
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,895
- Billy!
WYATT: He's all right, ma'am.

1042
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,809
Just got himself a
little liquored up.

1043
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,819
All right, on your feet.

1044
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,489
Billy! You get in the house.

1045
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,506
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with that boy.

1046
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,925
Way he's going now, he's gonna
end up like his father...

1047
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,264
...shot down for stealing cattle.

1048
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:54,313
You think you're pretty
tough, don't you, son?

1049
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,816
I never saw a gunslinger yet so tough
he lived to celebrate his 35th birthday.

1050
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,238
I learned one rule
about gunslingers.

1051
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,907
There's always a man faster
on the draw than you are.

1052
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:12,920
And the more you use a gun, the sooner
you're gonna run into that man.

1053
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:18,091
You think I don't know
what's inside of you.

1054
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,507
I had a couple of big brothers.

1055
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,640
They fought in the Civil War,
and I was too young to go.

1056
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:28,393
I tried to live up to them the same way
you're trying to live up to Ike and Finn.

1057
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:36,435
- You know about that, huh?
- You can bet I know about that.

1058
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,314
It's not that I wanna be a
gunfighter, exactly. It's just...

1059
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,649
I don't know,
sometimes I get lonely.

1060
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:48,576
All gunfighters are lonely.

1061
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:50,411
They live in fear.

1062
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,751
They die without a dime
or a woman or a friend.

1063
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:56,097
You know, I never thought
about it like that.

1064
01:27:56,123 --> 01:27:58,031
WYATT: Well, think about it.
Think about it.

1065
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:01,759
Billy, listen to the marshal.

1066
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:08,968
- I won't do it no more, Ma.
- Oh, Billy.

1067
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,458
What are you doing here?

1068
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:41,838
Just brought your kid
brother home, drunk.

1069
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,970
You should be proud, real proud.

1070
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,589
You better get riding.

1071
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,514
I wouldn't do that, Ike.

1072
01:28:56,456 --> 01:28:59,605
My friends in Tombstone might begin
to worry if I'm not back soon.

1073
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:03,689
That don't cut no ice with me, Wyatt.
You're out of your territory this time.

1074
01:29:03,797 --> 01:29:05,274
Am I?

1075
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:10,863
My appointment,
United States marshal.

1076
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,462
Sorry to disappoint you.

1077
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:25,798
Now, wait a minute, Wyatt.

1078
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:29,306
I'm not looking for a fight,
but you gotta stop pushing me.

1079
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,934
Why don't we sit down and talk it over?
I'll make you any kind of deal you ask.

1080
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:36,472
The only deal I want is for you to
run that stolen herd back to Mexico.

1081
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:37,981
Hyah!

1082
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:57,371
- Did you see the judge?
- I seen him.

1083
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:58,831
Well?

1084
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:03,465
There's no legal way you can keep a
United States marshal out of the county.

1085
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:06,672
The judge was packing up
to leave when I got there.

1086
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:09,921
I think it's about time we
all pack up and leave, Ike.

1087
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,761
Shut up, Frank.

1088
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,016
Only one thing we can do.

1089
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:16,678
We didn't have no trouble
till that Wyatt Earp got here.

1090
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:19,394
You're making sense now, Ike.

1091
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,274
All right.

1092
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:24,732
We got no choice.
We'll ambush him tonight.

1093
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:27,313
Ain't you forgetting about
the rest of the Earps?

1094
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:31,201
Now, look, we can handle the Earps
if we make this a personal fight.

1095
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:35,122
- What if they bring in Clum?
- They won't. They're too proud.

1096
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,624
They're gonna come to
us the way we want.

1097
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:41,503
It's a law, bigger than
any law in the books.

1098
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,542
Family pride.

1099
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:48,092
We'll get that Wyatt when
he makes his late round.

1100
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,302
Don't make no difference to me.

1101
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:07,717
Tired?

1102
01:31:07,743 --> 01:31:10,598
Yeah. I guess I must
have dozed a little.

1103
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,154
Betty sent some coffee.

1104
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,411
Well, that's gonna hit the spot.

1105
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:21,247
JIMMY: It's awful quiet.

1106
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:23,586
Too quiet.

1107
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:32,804
Wyatt, do you figure we're gonna have
to fight it out with the Clantons?

1108
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:36,558
I wish I knew, Jimmy.

1109
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:39,139
Maybe Ike will see how
hopeless it all is.

1110
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:48,736
You itching to get
back to California?

1111
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,897
I think about it all the time.

1112
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:54,905
- She must be quite a girl.
- Yes, she is.

1113
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,908
Well...

1114
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,328
...I better get to work.

1115
01:32:01,433 --> 01:32:04,537
Look, how about letting me make
the rounds for you tonight?

1116
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:08,461
I get awful lonesome sitting here
with nothing to do but think.

1117
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,547
Sure, you go ahead.
I could use some sleep.

1118
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:15,430
At least when I'm making the rounds,
it gives me something else to think about.

1119
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,748
(HOOVES BEATING)

1120
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:29,230
Ike's called the play.

1121
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:31,398
We'll do it his way now.

1122
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:33,810
Don't do that, Wyatt.
That's what they want.

1123
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:36,071
Don't let them push you
into a personal fight.

1124
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:38,152
That's mighty funny
coming from you.

1125
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:40,863
You're a lawman, Wyatt.
Don't throw away a lifetime's work.

1126
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,699
- Where's your logic?
- To hell with logic!

1127
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,868
That's my brother lying there.

1128
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,446
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

1129
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:30,788
- Who is it?
HOLLIDAY: Open the door!

1130
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:44,215
- Start talking, Kate.
- Doc...

1131
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,557
...I don't know nothing about it.

1132
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,093
Talk.

1133
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,555
Why?

1134
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,271
What difference does it make now?

1135
01:35:57,543 --> 01:36:00,863
I sure messed everything
up real good, ain't I?

1136
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:04,275
I wanted you back...

1137
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,736
...because I love you.

1138
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:12,959
And I thought if Wyatt was out of
the way, you'd come back to me.

1139
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:18,711
That's why I kept quiet when I...
When I heard them.

1140
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,501
I must've been out of my mind.

1141
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:22,756
Where?

1142
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,299
The Clanton ranch.

1143
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:29,809
Who was there?

1144
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:33,813
- I didn't want that boy to be killed.
- Who was there?

1145
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:38,184
Ike, Finn...

1146
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:41,191
...Cotton Wilson and
the MacLowerys.

1147
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:43,523
And Ringo?

1148
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:47,486
(SHOUTS)
Was Ringo there?

1149
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,996
Yes. Ringo was there.

1150
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:55,285
Doc.

1151
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:59,206
- Don't, Doc.
- Oh, please don't, Doc.

1152
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:01,420
Doc!

Please don't, Doc.

1156
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,104
Please don't kill me.

Oh, Doc.

1166
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:35,559
It's all right, honey.

1167
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,641
It's all right, honey.

1168
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:51,530
Wyatt. Ike sent me.

1169
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,640
I didn't have nothing
to do with it.

1170
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:03,942
I didn't know nothing.
You gotta believe me.

1171
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,504
I guess it's just because
