IRENE: Meat?
Where'd he get it?

152
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,433
He helped a rancher
with some butchering
and took his pay in beef.

153
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,933
Oh, I see.

154
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,933
We'll have dinner
as soon as he comes back.

some more firewood.

our cooking in here since
our kitchen roof fell in.

Well, we trifled
with some hamburgers.

163
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:51,467
But that meat smells
mighty interesting,
Mr. Parker.

It isn't often

are pretty scarce

there is...

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,067
Why don't you tell
them the truth?

173
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,067
He was fired because
he wouldn't collect graft

174
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,833
From the men that were
working under him.

175
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,767
Now, uh, we can't
prove that, Irene.

176
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,367
And, uh, besides,
these gentlemen
aren't interested.

177
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,367
Oh, yes we are.

178
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,267
Well, there's
an election coming up,

179
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,533
And we were notified
that we would
have to contribute

180
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,367
A week's pay to
the campaign fund.

181
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,067
Campaign fund.

182
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,567
Every dollar of that money
went into Balsinger's pocket.

183
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,167
LUKE: Well, anyway,

184
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:47,067
I refused to give it
and refuse to collect it
from the poor devils

185
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:50,700
Working under me
because they are
worse off than we are.

186
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:54,067
So Joe Balsinger said,
he'd make an example
of us Parkers.

187
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,300
That's what you get round here
when you stand up
for your rights.

188
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:00,400
Well, you're not
supposed to starve.

189
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,133
You could go on relief.

190
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,067
MR. PARKER:
No, no, we couldn't.

191
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,067
They turned me down flat.

192
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,833
That's controlled
by the same gang.

193
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,767
Besides, there's no relief
for a man that owns property.

194
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,933
Did, uh, you ever try
to borrow money

195
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,633
On a 1,000 acres
of dust and sand?

196
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,367
No.

197
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,133

have a real problem here.

with the kindling.
- Mmm.

Oh, uh,

204
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,700
Irene was so busy hating
Joe Balsinger,

205
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,567
She forgot to tell
you about the money.

206
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,067
- Money?
- STONY: Yes.

207
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,100
They had a dancing contest.
We won first prize, didn't we?

208
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,333
Go on, show 'em.

209
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:01,767
Oh, yes.

210
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,200
Here it is.

211
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,500
Twenty-dollars.

212
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,500
She's a darn good dancer.

213
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, I wouldn't have
gotten anything if
you hadn't danced with me.

214
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,133
Thank you.

215
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,167
Well, where is he?

216
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,567
He must have seen us coming.

217
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,633
WILL: Reach.
You're covered.

218
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,333
Go on, reach.

219
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,633
Now turn around.

220
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,433
Well, this is a fine way
to treat a couple
of friendly strangers.

221
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,300
Friendly? How do I know
you're friendly?

222
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,167
You'll have to take
our word for it.

223
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,800
Don't give me that.

224
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,333
I'll take the wind's word
that it's gonna rain.

225
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,067
And I'll take the sun's word
that it's gonna be clear.

226
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,067
But I've learned never to take
a man's word for anything.

227

But you don't mind
taking a man's steer
without asking him, do you?

When you're hungry,
you ain't thinking.

229

But you're not gonna
lock me up.

230
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,133
I'll kill anybody that
tries to lock me up.

on that killing stuff, bub.

they'll hang you.

had a talk with our boy?

didn't you, Tucson?

give it to him.

to see you here.

I've come to contribute
to the campaign fund.

Oh, that's fine.

There will be a job
for Mr. Parker, won't there?

270

Sure. Sure, have him
come around tomorrow.

271
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,467
He'd go on the labor gang.

272

Labor gang?
But he's a foreman.

Ah, I'm sorry,
that job's filled.

274
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,500
But he's not strong enough
for day labor.

You know, have him come
and see me when he is.

276

Oh, but he needs the job now,
he can't go on like this.

I'm sorry.
It's the labor gang
or nothing.

when he had a good thing.

for the contribution.

00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,700
Well, you didn't
have a chance.

342
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,633
What chance do I ever get?

343
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,067
Now, I know
it's been a little tough,

344
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,067
But things will get better.

345
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:47,733
So long, bub.
I'll be seeing you.

346
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,067
So long, Rusty.

(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

349
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,733
If Parker runs true to form,
he won't go home without meat.

350
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,467
We'd better spread out.

351
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:43,800

352
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:46,400
We finally caught you
with the goods.

"Parker has always
maintained that the right
of human beings to eat"

354

"Is higher than the right
of game to live."

355

"He claims the state
owes its first duty to
its citizens, not to animals."

356
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,700
Sounds like pretty good sense.

357
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,700
I've called an
emergency session
of this committee

358
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,733
To hear a startling story
of corruption.

359
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,767
I want you to hear it
as I have it.

whose character and integrity
I can vouch for.

Lady and gentlemen,

364
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,567
I'm here to tell you
about voters.

365
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:54,933
Voters dissatisfied,
not with their government,

366
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:58,567
But with a man
in their community
appointed by you.

367
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,933

very existence.

for jobs.

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,367
- This is serious.
- Serious?

371
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,533
There's going to be
a lot of people around here
glad to testify.

372
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Nobody is going to testify.

373

Hey, the old man
must be in the shed.

374
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,400
Oh, I am not
threatening you, Parker.

375
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:34,133
I'm just reminding
you that you've got a family.

376
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,700
And you better think of them
before you go
shooting off your mouth

To any
investigating committee.

378
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:41,733
I am thinking about
my youngsters,

379
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,367
And I'm thinking about
the sort of country

380
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,833
They ought to have
to grow up in.

381
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,633
Even if it is only
a dust bowl,

382
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,200
They've got the right
to be free in it.

383
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,100
Now you go back
to that tinhorn dictator
and tell him,

384
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,600
Here's one man
you couldn't buffalo.

385
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:07,133
That I'll tell the world
about him and his gang
of buzzards.

(CHUCKLES) Old timer,
I certainly admire
your speech. Shake.

00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,200
- (GRUNTING)
- You asked for it.

388
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,067
I wouldn't do that.

389
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:20,367
Thanks, boys.

390
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,367
- Are you hurt, Dad?
- No.

391
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:25,067
But if I didn't have a story
to tell before,

392
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,233
I've sure got
a good one now.

393
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,067
- And witnesses to prove it.
- Mmm.

394
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,067
All right, on your way.

395
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
You shouldn't have
said that, Father.

396
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,200
Balsinger would
know it anyway.

397
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:45,467
But now he'll do anything
to keep you from testifying.

398
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,533
That's right.

399
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,367
Now we'll have to see
that you and the rest of
the witnesses have protection.

400
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,467
I suspect we better
see the Sheriff right away.

401
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,700
Boys, you mustn't
go into town.

402
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:55,800
The Sheriff has a warrant
out for your arrest.

403
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:56,900
What for?

404
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,600
Wrecking Balsinger's office.

405
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,733
Well looks like he's trying
to keep us away
from that hearing too.

406
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,867
Yeah.

407
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,200
We'll notify the other
witnesses,

408
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:04,800
But we'll keep clear
at town.

409
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:06,400

out at the Parker place.

412
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,333
Get out there
and serve that warrant.

413
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,867
Right away.

What are you in for?

416
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:26,067
Well, according to
the warrant,

417
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,067
We're guilty of assault
and battery
and disturbing the peace.

418
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,200
Did Balsinger
have you arrested?

419
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:32,500
He did, huh?

420
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,700
Hearing must have
started by now.

421
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,067
Just how long,
are we supposed to wait?

422
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
I don't know,
I can't understand this.

423
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,967
Well, maybe you're
convinced by now that
you were misinformed.

424
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:09,833
Looks like Balsinger
won this hand.

425
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,600
I can't figure Parker
not showing up.

426
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,500
Well he might have seen to it
that he didn't.

427
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:15,433
You think they might...

428
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,933
Well, boys,
I'm turning you lose.

429
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:18,067
How come?

430
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:19,667
Balsinger dropped the charges.

431
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:22,833
Mighty nice of him,
now that the hearing's over.

432
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,333
Keep your chin up, kid.

433
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,300
You'll be out of here
in no time.

434
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,567
Yeah.

435
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,500

to the Parker place.

How bad is he hurt?

438
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,333
We don't know yet.

439
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,700
Anybody see who did it?

440
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,800
He went out to hitch up
the horse to take us
to the hearing

441
00:35:13,867 --> 00:35:15,967
And we found him like this.

442
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,700
Please, don't do
anything more.

443
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:21,933
We can't let Balsinger
get away with this.

444
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,600
Don't you see that
there's no use fighting.

445
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,267
She's right, Stony.

446
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:30,100
We appreciate what
you're trying to do for us,
but it's hopeless.

447
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:33,467
Yeah, looks like
all we've done
is make things worse.

448
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,733
Get Will a good lawyer.

449
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,433
Stony, we sure want
to compliment you.

450

How's that?

451
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,467
Well, you're getting
better all the time.

452
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:51,200
It only used to take
you about a week or so
to get us into trouble.

453

This time, you done
it in nothing flat.

454
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:55,067
All right.
We gummed things up,

455
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,233
But I'd still like to get
a crack at that guy.

got quite a working
over this afternoon, Will.

Yeah.

466
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,433
I'll kill him for this.

Get word to Balsinger
right away.

and he's on his way
to kill him.

472

to get you, Joe,

to blame for these
dead men as he is.

I heard you joined the posse.

477
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:44,200
We had to.

478
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:46,367
I suppose you think
we're hiding him.

to shoot on sight.

a chance?

If we can get to him first,
we'll see that
he gets a fair trial.

482
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:57,800
If we can find him.

483
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:01,467
I think I know where he is.

484
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,600
He may be up there.

of open country lie between
them and the outlaw's fire.

has found its mark.

the Sheriff thinks so

you down before
you can get near him.

to shoot Stony
the other night,

00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,433
He knows we're his friends.

513
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,833
And that's why I'm sure
he'll come with us.

514
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,933
Well, it might be
worth taking a chance.

515
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:27,733
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

516
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,067
Marshal Gregg speaking.

517
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,867
Oh, hello, Sheriff.

518
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:36,700
Well, stand by,
but don't take
anymore chances.

519
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,733
I'm sending out the cavalry.

520
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,567
Boys, Parker's killed
two more men.

521
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:43,700
Operator, operator.

522
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,167
Get me Fort McGuire.

523
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,633
RUSTY: Once the cavalry
gets there,
Will won't have a chance.

524
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,733
Unless we get there first.

525
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:15,300
(GUNSHOT)

526
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:23,067
(GUNSHOTS)

527
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:41,600
Remember, Sheriff,

528
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:44,167
No shooting,
no matter what happens.

529
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,400
Well, boys, you heard him.

530
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:48,967
No shooting under
any circumstances.

531
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,833
Standby, The Mesquiteers
are just starting.

532
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,067
Looks to me like
they're dead set
on committing suicide.

533
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:06,200
Up to now, no one has
even dared venture out

534
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,267
To bring back
the bodies of their
dead comrades.

535
00:47:55,433 --> 00:47:58,167
Brooke! Don't come any closer!

536
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:05,267
Don't come any closer, Brooke!

537
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:07,867
Will!

538
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:18,967
I'm gonna let
you have it, Brooke!

539
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:54,067
Well, it looks like
he's outsmarted us again.

540
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:57,067
And he's probably
headed back into the hills.

541
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:07,267
I don't blame
you for giving up
that manhunt.

542
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:09,300
Those nervous deputies
are more dangerous

543
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:10,800
Than that goofy
wild man, Parker.

544
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,833
So you think he's crazy too?

545
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,233
Why, sure he is.
Crazy as a tick.

546
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,367
I know all about him.

547
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:21,167
I'm with the broadcasting
company that's been
sending out the news.

548
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:23,767
If he only knew
of all the lies we've been
telling about him.

549
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,100
(LAUGHING)

550
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,100
Maybe he doesn't care.

551
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:29,800
Maybe he's used
to lies by now.

552
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:30,900
What do you mean?

553
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:35,900
Everything's a lie here
in this dust bowl.

554
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:37,733
What's the use in trying
to be good and work hard

555
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,833
When you can't
get work to do?

556
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,167
What's the use in trying
to get ahead and save money
when you can't earn it?

557
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,533
DOYLE: Sort of radical,
aren't you?

558
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,900
Maybe.

559
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:49,067
Are you going
all the way to town?

560
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:52,233
No, I want to stop by
and see my folks first.

561
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,500
You can drop me off
at the Parker place.

562
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:56,067
The Parker place?

563
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:58,633
Yeah. That's where I live.

564
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,833
I'm Will Parker.

565
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,600
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

566
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:06,167
Maybe you'd better get out
and walk, we'd both be safer.

567
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,900
Hello, Sheriff's office?

568
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:25,167
This is Doyle. Radio operator.

569
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:28,333
Sheriff, we just got word on
the short wave that Parker's
headed for his home.

570
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,000
Mount up, men.

571
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:40,067
Hello, Dad.

572
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:44,367
You shouldn't be here, son.

573
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,067
Yeah, I know.

574
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:48,467
I come to say goodbye.

575
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,500
Before they put me away.

576
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,633
Goodbye.

577
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:21,933
Mother?

578
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:32,433
My son.

579
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:58,400
(TIRES SCREECHING)

580
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,767
Good morning, Mr. Balsinger.
Any news?

581
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:18,100
No. Now I'm not worried.

582
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:20,667
Parker's 40 miles
away from here
and surrounded by an army.

583
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:22,533
In fact, he's probably
dead by now.

584
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,067
(DOOR OPENS)

585
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:40,667
Take a good look
at that money,
it's the last you'll ever see.

586
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,633
Look, kid.

587
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,167
You can have it all
if you let me go.

588
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:46,433
There's nearly 5,000 there.

589
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Getting kind of generous,
aren't you?

590
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:53,067
I've often wondered
what it'd feel like
to have this much money.

591
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,433
Now I don't guess
it will do either
one of us any good.

592
00:53:57,533 --> 00:53:59,433
Get on outside
and you can
tell 'em I'm here.

593
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,067
Come on.

594
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,967
There's hardly a man
in this town you haven't
hurt or robbed

595
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:09,067
In some way or another.

596
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,200
Any one of them would
like to take a shot
at you if they dared.

597
00:54:11,267 --> 00:54:13,700
Well, I'm gonna
give them a chance.

598
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:16,767
(GUNSHOT)

599
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:24,967
That's just to let 'em know
we're coming.

600
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:42,733
(CROWD TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

601
00:54:54,267 --> 00:54:55,333
Gosh.

602
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:13,467
- So long.
- Bye.
