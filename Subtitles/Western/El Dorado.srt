he came in here a little while ago ?

00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:49,645
He in the washroom.
He shaves, he cleans up.

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,666
Thanks.

32
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,952
Hi, Cole.

33
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,407
That's a voice I'd know anywhere.

34
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:17,248
JP Harrah. Wait till I get
some of the soap out of my eyes.

35
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,423
I heard you were made sheriff...

36
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:27,343
- What's the idea of the gun ?
- Just ' till I find out 
which side you're on, Cole.

37
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,719
- What do you mean ?
- I heard you were working  for Bart Jason.

38
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:34,940
Well, Nothing's set yet.

39
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:39,104
He offered me good money, but I haven't
found out what I have to do to earn it.

40
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,777
- Would you like to hear ?
- Yeah, go ahead.

41
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:45,949
Cole, that's about  close enough to that gun.

42
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:49,949
I just wanted to see
if you'd slowed down any.

43
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,029
Not that much.

44
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:55,032
What were you saying about Jason ?

45
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:59,171
Well, he showed up here around the end
of the war with a pocket full of money.

46
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,627
Nobody seems to be able to
find out where he got it from...

47
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,337
but...everybody else
around here was broke.

48
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:07,511
- You know how it was then.
- Yeah, all over Texas.

49
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:11,760
Well,having money, he started to grow.
Now, he can't grow any bigger until
he gets more water.

50
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:13,973
There's only one place to get it.

51
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:17,928
Trouble is, somebody was there
ahead of him. About 20 years ahead.

52
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:20,063
A man named Kevin MacDonald got here

53
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,273
when there was nothing
but Indians and coyotes.

54
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:26,109
Mr. MacDonald's got four boys
and a girl, and they've all worked real hard.

55
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:29,946
They hung together through 
all the rough times,and now that 
things are beginning to look up,

56
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,739
MacDonald's in no mind to sell.

57
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:37,123
So he's holding and Jason's pushing...
and I'm standing right in the middle.

58
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,960
It's not the way it was told to me.

59
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:44,172
That's the way it is, Cole, I guess
you're supposed to take care of me.

60
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,592
Well, not that I couldn't...do it, Harrah,
but...I don't think I'd like that.

61
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,093
I'm glad to hear you say that.

62
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:56,431
Not that I couldn't handle you...
but...I don't think I'd like that either.

63
00:04:56,643 --> 00:05:01,720
Suppose I tell Jason that
I had a long talk with you and...

64
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:04,306
and you scared me off.

65
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,726
- Good enough ?
- Good enough.

66
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:10,028
You can put that thing down now.

67
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:13,032
There's somethin' familiar 
about that gun.

68
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:16,032
I just had it fixed-up 
the way you had yours.

69
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:18,055
You got lucky with it,
I thought I'd try it.

70
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,555
Ha !

00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:20,623
[Knocking at Door]

72
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:24,752
Cole Thornton, you decent ? 
You'd better be, 'cause 
I'm a comin' in.

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,214
Ah, it's good to see you.  You know when
they told me you were here,
I didn't believe them !

74
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:32,585
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me, I thought that...

Hi, JP [ Laughing ]

76
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:42,102
- What's so funny ?
- This whole thing. [ Continuing to Laugh ]

77
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,055
Do you know what
she's laughing about ?

78
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,437
I gather you knew him
before you knew me.

79
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:52,475
- Before you ? I knew her when she was a kid.
- Didn't you know that, JP ?

80
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:57,778
No, you never mentioned that.
Up until now, I thought you had good taste.

81
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:01,616
And, up until now,
I thought she had good taste.

82
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:04,112
[ Sigh ]...I'm awful glad you two are friends.

83
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,579
We may not be when we
think this thing over.

84
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:10,962
- If you aren't, I'm through with both of you.
- You know something,Cole, I think
We better get ourselves a new girl.

85
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:13,752
- Yeah.
- You better not.
-Why not ?

86
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,628
I'm girl enough for you both.
Say,can I buy you a drink ?

87
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:23,006
Well, I'd like that very much,
but I promised JP I'd do something
for him, didn't I ?

88
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:26,268
- Yes, you did.
- Of Course, if you want 
to do my errand...

89
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,725
No, you do your own work, Cole.

90
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:32,765
- Will you buy us that drink
a couple of hours from now ?
- Yeah, sure will.

91
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,315
Where is this Bart Jason's place ?

92
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,776
You take the main road
north out of town.

93
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:40,735
And after you cross the creek,
and you come to a big rock.

94
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:44,075
- Big rock.
- That's right. That's 
MacDonald's boundary.

95
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:45,989
MacDonald's ?
-Yeah.

96
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,872
You ride east from there 
about 3 miles and you get 
to Bart Jason's ranch.

97
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,996
Maudie, remember, I'm coming back.

98
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,917
- Oh, I left some things...
- I'll take care of it.

99
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,001
Thanks.

100
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:07,680
- You mad at me, JP ?
- You know better than that, Maudie.

101
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,807
Ha...you must like that man.

102
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:13,222
- Want me to tell you about him ?
- You don't have to tell me about Cole.

103
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:17,312
I know I don't.
That's why I want to.

104
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:21,731
I met Cole right after my 
husband was killed.   I did 
tell you that.

105
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:25,772
- Yeah, you told me.
- Well, there I was, stranded...

A gambler's widow,
not a chip to my name.

107
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:35,366
Cole was awful good to me.
Gave me a stake, helped me
get on my feet.

108
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:38,461
Never would take a...

109
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:43,168
[ Sighs ] I don't know, JP.
With Cole and me, I guess it's a...

110
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:46,628
- I'll always think of him as a...
- He's a top hand.

111
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:52,675
- I guess so.
- Yeah, well, Cole always 
was pretty lucky.

112
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:57,015
- Have you known him a long time ?
- Yeah, I've known him a long time,
since before the war.

113
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,480
- We've...ah...travelled some together.
- Sure, I know what that means.

114
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,445
It means either you saved his life,
or he saved yours, or both.

115
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,783
And neither of you
will talk about it....  Men !

Would you like it set 
to music, Maudie,
with a full orchestra ?

117
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,787
- Well, I'll see you, Maudie.
- Hey, don't forget to come back !

118
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:22,661
- Well, I'm certainly not going
to leave you alone with him.
- You're not a friend.

Howdy, Roy. Something wrong ?

123
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,575
Doc Miller sent me out, said to 
tell you Bart Jason hired 
himself a gunhand:

124
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,003
Cole Thornton.  And Thorton 
rode out there about 
an hour ago.

125

Doc wanted you to know.
He said to tell you 
to be careful.

Thanks, Roy. Tell Doc
I'm much obliged 
to both of you.

OK, Pa.

- Luke.
- Yes, Pa.

131
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,900
Get up there on that rock.  If you see
anybody coming, fire a shot into the air,
that'll  give us a little warning.

I've been expecting you.
Get off your horse, and make
yourself comfortable.

I won't be here
long enough for that.

doesn't quite see it my way.

- Day or two.

Bring something to eat, 
comidas....Plenty of it
-Si Señor.

327
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,080
- Right away.
- Something to drink, also, vamanos.

328

A Five and a one.

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,155
- Charlie Hagan.
- Yeah.

331

You want something from me ?

332
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:43,572
- You don't remember me, do you ?
- No.

333
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:52,074
- Do you remember this hat ?
- Well, why in the hell would
I remember a hat ?  [ Laughter ]

Who was this fellow I killed ?
A friend of yours ?

338
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:07,178
You could say that.

339
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,810
- When did I do this, boy ?
- Two years ago, come September.

340
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,273
You and three others.

341

Natchez-Under-the-Hill,
on the Mississippi.

342
00:29:19,949 --> 00:29:26,117
He was a gambler, named
Johnny Diamond...
and he was kind of an old man.

343
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:32,209
- Shouldn't have taken four of you.
- Do you remember, Charlie ?

344
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:35,793
I remember. He was a cardsharp.
He was cheating.

345
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:39,629
No...no, he was good.
He didn't have to cheat.

346
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:44,296
- It shouldn't have taken 4 of you, Joey.
- No, it shouldn't of.

347
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:50,092
Well, I'm sure glad you
remember, Mr. Hagan.
The other three did.

348
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:54,897
- The other three ?
- Yeah, I caught up with them.

349
00:29:55,608 --> 00:29:57,980
You're the last.

350
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:02,652
And now I think you better stand up.

351
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,986
Stand up, Charlie.
I'm curious to see how he does this.

352
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:09,242
He doesn't have a gun.

353
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:13,279
And like he said,
it shouldn't have
taken four of you.

354
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,289
Stand up, Charlie.

355
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,733
You with the hat.

356
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:55,498
You killed Charlie
'cause he killed your 
friend, right ?

357
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:59,791
- That's right.
- Well, it happens, Charlie was
a good friend of mine.

358
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:02,416

364
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:19,809
That's because they're no good.

365
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:22,607
- Pick up your gun.
- What ?

366
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:27,276
You want to try again, now ?
Pick up your gun.

- Money's good.

Then I'd ask about the job.

Thanks for the drink, gentlemen.

Good evening.

me why you have such a
great passion for my company ?

for a couple of minutes ?

Mind telling me 
who hired you ?

Do you know him ?

00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,173
We met. He offered me
the job a few months back.
I didn't take it.

Do you know who 
you're up against ?

412
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:17,230
Yeah. The sheriff, JP Harrah.

413
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:19,852
I understand he used to be
pretty good with a gun.

414
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:23,192
Not just pretty good, McLeod.
He's the...

00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,979
- The fourth man you told me about.
- That's right.

00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:29,695
Well, he used to be.
He's not any more.

00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:33,160
- Well, what happened ?
- What usually happens to a man ?

00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:39,376
Seems like he tangled with
some wandering petticoat...
he's been drunk ever since.

420
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:44,837
You figure to move in before
he sobers up, or...before
they get a new sheriff ?

421
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,884
- And you're not coming in ?
- No.

422
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,674
I suppose you have your reasons.

423
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,974
It's probably just as well.

424
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:57,467
With two like us in
the same bunch...

425
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,597
sooner or later we'd have
to find out which one
of us was faster.

426
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:05,611
Yeah, I guess you're right.

427
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,235
So long, Thornton.

428
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:13,941
I thought we were going.

429
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:17,200
Mississippi, just listen.

430
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:23,289
McLeod, would you like
to walk out that door first,
ahead of us ?

431
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:26,586
Nope.   I don't believe I would.

432
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:29,917
I didn't think so.

433
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:33,007
Pedro, Milt, can you hear me ?

434
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,920
- We hear you.
- I'm coming out.

435
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,703
Where are you ?

436
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:45,142
- Jeffe...over here.
- Come on out.

437
00:35:49,444 --> 00:35:51,732
Further into the light, hurry.

438
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:55,815
Now drop your guns.

439
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:03,995
Come here.

440
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,209
Inside.

441
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:15,626
- That all right, Thornton ?
- Good enough.

442
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:18,673
Mississippi, get their guns.

443
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:22,891
If it's all right with you,
McLeod,  we'll drop 'em at
the sheriff's office

444
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:26,179
and your boys can
pick 'em up on their
way out of town.

445
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:30,186
- Sounds reasonable.
- Much obliged.

446
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:32,973
Call it professional courtesy.

447
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:44,867
Want to get something
to eat, Mississippi ?

448
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:50,625
Mr. Thornton, I would've walked
out of here and right into those two
fellas if you hadn't stopped me.

449
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,746
- I asked if you were hungry.
- I'm trying to thank you.

450
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:57,622
I'm hungry !   That shivaree
you put on in there
interrupted my supper.

451
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:59,756
It wore out our welcome.

452
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,086
Now, we'll have to find
someplace else to eat.

453
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:05,596
- Now ?
- Now.

454
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:20,321
¿ Que quieres mas ?

455
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,563
She wants to know
if you want something else.

456
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,322
Just coffee.

457
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:26,323
Café, por favor.

458
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,745
- Not very hungry huh ?
- No, not so much.

459
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:38,748
- A little green around the gills.
- Yep.

460
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,668
I just finished something tonight
I've been two years doing.

461
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,005
What are you figuring on
doing next ?  Going back
to the river ?

462
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:50,219
I haven't thought
much about what I'm
going to do next.

463
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,431
The river won't be
the same without old...

464
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:56,730
Well, if you're going to stay
around here, I've got two pieces
of advice for you...

465
00:37:56,815 --> 00:38:01,192
Get rid of that hat.
Learn how to use a gun.

466
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:04,563
- I don't figure on gettin'
rid of that hat.
- No ?

467
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,029
No.

468
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,704
Johnny Diamond, he's
the friend I...ah...
the man that raised me.

469
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:20,417
All he left behind was
a gold watch and this hat.

470
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:25,498
I had to sell that gold watch
a year or so back.

471
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:29,543
So, I guess
I'll just hang on to that hat.

472
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,929
What about learning to use a gun ?

473
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,928
Johnny didn't believe in guns.
He always thought that...

474
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:38,723
He's dead.   Think about that.

475
00:38:40,189 --> 00:38:43,225
Unless you can learn to
stay out of trouble.

476
00:38:43,317 --> 00:38:47,611
That's one thing even old Johnny
couldn't teach me to do.

477
00:38:47,696 --> 00:38:52,025
Well, I'll be moving along.
Good luck to you.

478
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:55,946
Ah...you don't suppose
I could ride along with ya ?

479
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,790
- Nope.
- That's plain enough.

480
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:03,167
- Well, I hope everything 
works out all right.
- What works out ?

481
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:05,620
Whatever it is you're going to do.

482
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:10,083
Pay for the meal, will you ?
So long.

483
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:17,879
#

484
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:51,453
Hold it, Cochise.

485
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:54,716
Steady boy. lt'll take a minute.

486
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:13,227
Cole !   Cole Thornton !

487
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:15,567
Where are you ?

488
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:20,523
Close enough to blow
your hat off if I hadn't 'a
recognised it.

489
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:33,754
- What are you doing here ?
- Looking for you.

490
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,539
Don't you know
better than to follow
a man that way ?

491
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:40,588
- Sorry, I don't know 
there's another way.
- You almost got shot.

492
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,638
- You fall off your horse ?
- Yeah.

493
00:40:43,723 --> 00:40:45,431
- You hurt ?
- No.

494
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:47,556
Well, there's something
the matter with you.

495
00:40:47,644 --> 00:40:52,222
Well look, I've got a
bullet in my back, sometimes it
presses against something and...

496
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:57,309
I get a screaming pain,  then
there's nothing...it goes numb,
and I can't use this hand.

497
00:40:57,486 --> 00:41:01,698
- How long does that last ?
- Just for a while.   Why are
you following me ?

498
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:05,690
Well, I got to thinkin' about
what you're going to do.

499
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:08,534
And just what am I gonna do ?

500
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:14,375
You're going to that town,
El Dorado, to help your friend
against McLeod and his bunch.

501
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:17,172
How do you know
he's my friend ?

502
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,294
That look on your face
when you heard he'd
turned into a drunk.

503
00:41:22,135 --> 00:41:24,708
Well, this thing's wearing off.

504
00:41:24,804 --> 00:41:27,295
Give me a hand
up on my horse.

505
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,973
You sure your friend's
worth helping ?

506
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:39,229
You just spent two years
chasing some fellas that
killed a friend of yours.

507
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,568
You think your friend
was worth two years ?

508
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:46,782
- I guess I asked a fool question.
- You did.

509
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:07,216
Give him a breather.
Slow him down.

510
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:11,964
I was wondering.
Just how good is this McLeod ?

511
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:17,722
I don't know first hand,
but they say he's one 
of the best.

512
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:23,317
I figure he'd be pretty mad you...
you turning him down and showing-up
on the other side.

513
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:26,485
- I hope he is.
- How come ?

514
00:42:26,654 --> 00:42:29,904
Fellow in his business
hasn't got a right to get mad.

515
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:32,695
He gets mad,
he's not so good.

516
00:42:32,785 --> 00:42:35,952
So the madder he gets,
the better I like it.

517
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:38,790
Ha !  Sure wish I was
there to see that.

518
00:42:38,874 --> 00:42:41,709
Why do you want to keep
sticking your nose in this ?

519
00:42:41,794 --> 00:42:45,127
Maybe I could help.
You saved my life two times.

520
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:48,713
But I'm going to be too busy
to keep doing that.

521
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,545
- You can't even use a gun.
- You could teach me.
I need somebody to teach me.

522
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:56,129
Johnny Diamond always
told me to get the best.

523
00:42:56,224 --> 00:43:00,352
Well, he was right there.
But you're not going to El Dorado.

524
00:43:00,436 --> 00:43:04,303
- Oh, I'm not, huh ?
- No, you're not.

525
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:11,190
"Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,

526
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:15,533
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long..."

527
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:18,156
- What's that all about ?
- Just a poem.

528
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,284
One of Johnny Diamond's favorites.

529
00:43:20,372 --> 00:43:23,326
Let's see: "Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,

530
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,375
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
singing a song,

531
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:31,375
"In search of El Dorado.

532
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:36,542
"Over the mountains of the moon,
Down the valley of the shadow,

533
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:39,472
"Ride, boldly ride..."

534
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:44,515
Always liked that poem, too.
Makes me want to ah...

535
00:43:44,603 --> 00:43:49,348
Ride, boldly ride ?
Well, it don't work out that way.

536
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:51,599
I'm learning that.

537
00:43:58,658 --> 00:44:01,529
Oh, Hell !   Hold it, Cochise.

538
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,489
- Step down off that horse.
- You always giving people orders ?

539
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,966
You wanted to learn to shoot.

540
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:27,473
Right out there.

541
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:35,025
Hold it, Mississippi.
That's no way to use a handgun.

542
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:39,237
You gotta to draw and fire,
and you gotta be quicker than
somebody else doing the same thing.

543
00:44:39,322 --> 00:44:41,361
Like this.

544
00:44:43,576 --> 00:44:45,533
I see.

545
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:55,585
- How's that ?
- Were you aiming at that cholla ?

546
00:44:57,005 --> 00:45:01,916
- No, the place you were shooting at.
- 'Fraid it's useless.

547
00:45:02,636 --> 00:45:08,471
Well, we'll be passing through
Cuervo.  I'll have a talk
with the Swede.

548
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:10,716
Who's the Swede ?

549
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:14,061
An old friend of
mine...a gunsmith.
-Aah !

550
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:22,233
There's the place.

551
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:35,207
Why, Cole Thornton !

552
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:39,537
- Swede, good to see you.
- And what brings you around here ?

553
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:44,587
Well, I'm looking for a
gun for a fella that can't
shoot...Mississippi.

554
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,585
Swede Larson.

555
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:50,592
- Can you help us ?
- Yaha, I think, I've got just the
gun you're looking for.

556
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:52,638
Well good !

557
00:45:54,573 --> 00:45:55,683
Wow !

558
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,305
How wide will that shot spread ?
- Well, now....
- I mean, how big a pattern ?

559
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:04,272
I don't know.   The fellow
who used it before, he
couldn't see too good.

560
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,066
He just shoot where he hear
somebody talk.

561
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:10,606
- What happened to him ?
- He has a fight in a saloon.

562
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,820
The piano player
he make so much noise,

563
00:46:13,912 --> 00:46:17,530
he couldn't hear the
other man, so he just
shoot the piano player,

564
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:19,663
and they hung him.

565
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:22,917
- Looks pretty good to me.
- Shoots good, too.

566
00:46:23,004 --> 00:46:25,162
How about ammunition ?

567
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:28,956
- Four or five boxes
ought to be enough.
- Good.

568
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:33,095
- Well, Mississippi, looks
like what you need.
- It sure is !

569
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,474
- Pay the man.       ...Swede.
- Cole, you come back soon.

570
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:45,563
A likely spot to
try that new gun.

571
00:46:55,034 --> 00:46:57,073
Try that cactus.

572
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,220
[ Shotgun Blast ]

573
00:47:09,756 --> 00:47:12,212
You can't miss with that.

574
00:47:13,009 --> 00:47:15,049
It's all right.

575
00:47:22,185 --> 00:47:26,811
- How far is it from here to El Dorado ?
- We'll be in there around midnight.

576
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:33,579
 #

577
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:38,613
Well, where are we headed ?

578
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,191
- To see a girl.
- To see a girl ?

579
00:47:41,286 --> 00:47:43,445
Yes, a girl.

580
00:47:43,538 --> 00:47:45,994
Don't you think I
could know a girl ?

581
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:50,080
- I always make you mad, don't I ?
- Mostly.

582
00:47:52,672 --> 00:47:56,005
Hold it...this, yeah !
This is it.

583
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,311
Cole.  Cole !!

584
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:28,699
Maudie, keep it quiet.
I got to talk to you.

585
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,699
I'll let you in.

586
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:45,093
- Keep your eyes open.
- Oh, You sure pick the 
darnedest times to...

587
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,514
- Who's your friend ?
- My name's Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

588
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,218
- Just call him Mississippi for now.
- Hi, Mississippi.

589
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:54,351
- You stay out here and watch.
- Couldn't I..?

590
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:56,396
No.

591
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:04,562
Cole, I'm so glad to see you.
I've got so many things to tell you.

592
00:49:04,657 --> 00:49:09,900
Maudie, there's a lot I've
got to say to you, but first I've
got to have some answers.

593
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:14,657
- Are there any strangers in town ?
- No, no, I'd have known if there were.

594
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,873
This one you'd have noticed:

595
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,376
A dark, thin faced man,
with a scar here and a marled eye.

596
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:23,251
- Nelse McLeod.
- Nelse ? I've heard of him.

597
00:49:23,341 --> 00:49:26,342
Should've had four or five
riders with him.

598
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:28,586
- He's not here yet.
- Welll, good....

599
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,005
at least we beat them in.

600
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:33,305
Now, about JP.

601
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:39,182
- Want the whole story ?
- Just don't make it too long.

602
00:49:39,273 --> 00:49:42,476
After you left,
I didn't see much of him.

603
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:47,230
Oh, he'd drop in for
a drink once in a while.
I guess he was lonely.

604
00:49:47,323 --> 00:49:51,402
One day a girl came into
town, just stepped off
the stage and...

605
00:49:51,493 --> 00:49:53,486
Well, you know how kind...

606
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:58,620
Yeah, she probably had big
sad eyes and a long sad story.
That's his type.

607
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:03,121
Yeah. She was no good.
I tried to tell him, 
so did others.

608
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:06,747
Bull told him
and he knocked Bull down.

609
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:11,550
So JP had found out the
hard way.  She ran off
with a drummer.

610
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,721
He's...he's not been sober since.
It's been about two months.

611
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:17,974
Well, that he's going
to have to get over in a hurry.

612
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,936
- Is he over at the jail ?
- He's still sheriff, though
I don't know why.

613
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:28,017
We'll mosey on...
Oh, have you got a room
for Mississippi and me ?

614
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:31,149
Oh... sure !   Hey, have you
eaten anything lately ?

615
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:36,031
- No.
- I'll have something ready
for you when you get back.

616
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,946
I'm glad you're here.

617
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:42,785
- Don't tell anybody you saw us.
- I won't.

618
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,965
-Well, I found one thing out.
- What's that ?

619
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,291
You know a girl.
-Ha !

620
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,722
Hold it !

621
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:08,186
It's as far as you
can come now.

622
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,609
Unless you've got 
some business here.

623
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:17,528
I sure have got business here, Bull.
Cole Thornton.

624
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:18,867
Cole Thornton !

625
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,904
If it hadn't been so dark
I might have spotted you.

626
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,321
Might have anyhow, if I hadn't
been trying to figure out...

627
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:27,416
what that other fellow's
got on top of his head.

628
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,249
- It's called a hat.
- Well, I'll have to take 
your word for it.

629
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,588
Friend of mine.
They call him Mississippi.

630
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,714
- Glad to know you.
- Bull.

631
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:40,259
Glad you're here, Cole.
Our friend the sheriff
ain't so good.

632
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,469
I just talked to Maudie.

633
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:45,724
He's back there...sleepin'.

634
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,853
Beins as how you've known him
longer than I have...

635
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:52,856
you know enough to be careful
how you wake him up.

636
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:55,480
'Cause he's a bad one
when he's drinkin'.

637
00:51:55,569 --> 00:51:58,689
He ain't put that
stopper back in that bottle
in a coon's age.

638
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:03,905
Yeah, I know. You got someplace
where you can put these
horses under cover ?

639
00:52:03,994 --> 00:52:06,236
- Sure.
- Give him a hand.

640
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:11,834
Oh, Bull, I'd just as soon
everybody didn't know we

02:04:36,668 --> 02:04:42,291
Well, how would you know ?
You've been using it first under
one arm  and then the other.

1574
02:04:42,423 --> 02:04:47,465
Fine friend !   Trying to
keep a fellow from doing
what he wants to do.

1575
02:04:47,964 --> 02:04:50,024
[JP Laughs ]

1576
02:04:50,139 --> 02:04:53,223
I reckon' the way to get him
to do something is to
tell him not to do it.

1577
02:04:53,309 --> 02:04:55,432
Not if he didn't want to
do it in the first place.

1578
02:04:55,519 --> 02:04:58,306
- Reckon he'll stay here ?
- Yeah, could be.

1579
02:04:58,397 --> 02:05:01,066
Be a good thing to have him here.

1580
02:05:01,149 --> 02:05:05,277
Suppose you'll likely to wait a bit,
find a new gal,

1581
02:05:05,362 --> 02:05:07,604
make a fool of yourself
all over again.

1582
02:05:07,697 --> 02:05:11,446
Most likely.   If you leave me,
Bull, I could be driven to it.

1583
02:05:11,534 --> 02:05:14,405
- Well, I ain't said I was gonna leave ya.
- You as much as said it.

1584
02:05:14,495 --> 02:05:16,821
Now, stop putting
words in my mouth.

1585
02:05:16,914 --> 02:05:20,579
I just can't do anything
right according to you.
Bull, I need you.

1586
02:05:20,668 --> 02:05:22,993
- You what ?
- I need you, Bull.

1587
02:05:23,087 --> 02:05:26,290
Well, now if you start
being nice to me,
I'll quit you for sure.

1588
02:05:26,382 --> 02:05:30,711
Shock'd be too much.  I'd as
sooner have you hungover
and nasty.

1589
02:05:30,803 --> 02:05:34,800
Speaking of that,
how about a little drink, Bull ?

1590
02:05:36,099 --> 02:05:39,800
Darn it ! Took you a long time
to think of that one.

1591
02:05:41,897 --> 02:05:46,226
- That was good work, sheriff.
- Thank you, friend.

1592
02:05:46,317 --> 02:05:50,860
Sheriff, it looks like
you're going to keep your job.

1593
02:05:50,947 --> 02:05:54,731
Yeah, it'll be a nice quiet town
after you leave, Cole.

1594
02:05:54,825 --> 02:05:57,067
How do you know I'm leaving ?

1595
02:05:57,161 --> 02:06:00,660
We just don't need
your kind around here.

1596
02:06:01,342 --> 02:06:03,182
