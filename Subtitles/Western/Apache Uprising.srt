raid, don't you, captain?

129
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,127
Chivington
went too far.

130
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,529
He took things
into his own hands,

131
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,131
But there was
a court martial.

132
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,265

is joining us tomorrow.

He's been
riding the territory

154
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,022
I'll reserve my judgment
until then.

155
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:12,424
Well, captain, if he's
worth his salt...

156
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,162
He'll tell you
that the Indian war

157
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:17,429
Has spilled over
into this country.

158
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,498
I'll deal with them
when they come.

159
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,134
I've fought sioux
and Cheyenne before.

160
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:26,272
I don't think the apache
will be much different.

161
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,441
Captain,
about 100 years ago,

162
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,179
The great sioux
came South to make war
with the apache.

163
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,181
And when it was over,

164
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,184
You could
follow the trail
they took home

165
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,021
By the skeletons
of their warriors.

166
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,524
Now,
that's what the sioux
knew about the apache.

167
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:48,127
You know what
the word apache means?

168
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,097
It means enemy,

169
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,967
A 24-hour-a-day enemy,

170
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,437
An enemy to anything
that walks on two legs...

171
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,139
Gringo,
Mexican, or Indian.

172
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,009
Now you think that over,

173
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:06,213
And you get yourself
a good night's sleep,

174
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,215
Because you're
going to need it

175
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,217
Before you get
to apache Wells.

176
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,319
Good night.

177
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,908
Now wouldn't you think
vance could have picked

178
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,910
A better place to meet

179
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,411
Than this flea-bitten
barrio?

180
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,414
The last three days
all you've done
is bellyache.

181
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,316
Why don't you quit
trying to second-guess

182
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,053
A man like vance Buckner?

183
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,554
He's ramrodding
this outfit.

184
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,617
Bartender.

185
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,293
Boy, I'm dry
as this dust.

186
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,693
Bring us a bottle.

187
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,695
None of that bar stuff,
something good.

188
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,299
A big fella
with a scar
'cross his cheek

189
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,700
Check into
the hotel yet?

190
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,502
Sure did.
Came in yesterday.

191
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,604
He's upstairs
in room 6.

192
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,673
Friend of yours?

193
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,646
I just asked you
if he was here.

194
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:50,050
What do you care
if he's a friend of mine?

195
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,052
I didn't mean anything,
mister.

196
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,054
I was just
making conversation.

197
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,287
Yeah?

198
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,058
Well, don't make none
with me, see?

199
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,960
All right, kid.
We don't need
no trouble.

200
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,096
Henry didn't mean
anything by it.

201
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,098
He just likes
to talk a lot.

202
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,500
Yeah? Then
you talk to him,

203
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,635
And keep your nose
out of my business.

204
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,103
You hear me now?

205
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,105
Come on, Toby.
That's enough.

206
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,308
I don't know what's
bothering you, Sonny.

207
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,709
I don't much care.

208
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,212
Henry, I'll talk
to you later.

209
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,446
O.K., Hank.

210
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,743
All right, Sonny,
on your feet.

211
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,345
You want some more?

212
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,746
Oh, no.

213
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,482
No, I had enough.

214
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,086
You beat me
fair and square.

215
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,486
What do you say

216
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,455
We just forget about it
and have a drink, huh?

217
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,690
Why not?

218
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,692
I never let a fight

219
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,661
Stand in the way
of a drink.

220
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,438
[Gunshot]

221
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,440
Kid, you could
get yourself killed

222
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,842
Stepping out of line.

223
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,444
This hombre
put his hands on me.

224
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,847
Nobody can do that
and get away with it.

225
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,849
I'm going to tell you
something, vance.

226
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:31,450
You ain't bulletproof.

227
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,221
A slug
can chop you down.

228
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,224
Someday I'm going
to get tired of your talk

229
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,226
And make you
pull that gun.

230
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,527
That'll be
the last thing you'll do.

231
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,130
He didn't
mean nothing, vance.

232
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,530
He's young. He'll learn.

233
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,533
He better,
or he won't get any older.

234
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,236
Get upstairs.

235
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,472
But, Mr. Buckner,

236
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:56,308
Who's going to pay
for the damage to my saloon?

237
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,212
I'll make it good.
Figure out the cost.

238
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,780
Get him tended to.

239
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:04,616
The kid stepped
out of line.
That's all.

240
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,719
I'm standing drinks
for everybody.

241
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,822
Everybody at the bar
on the double!

242
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,902
[Choking]

243
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,205
You crazy,
stupid killer.

244
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,875
Just had
to start something,
didn't you?

245
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,878
I told you
to keep him in line.

246
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,882
You know how he is
when he's mad.

247
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,483
He just goes crazy.

248
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,486
You breathe
out of turn,
and you're dead.

249
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,588
Come on, vance,
what's the deal?

250
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,793
$80,000.

251
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,628
Is that worth
the trip here?

252
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,230
That's better
than $25,000 apiece.

253
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,232
20 for each of you.

254
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,766
I'm taking
the first 40,000.

255
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,202
Any objections?

256
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,602
Yeah, I got one.

257
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,273
We get the short end
of the stick.

258
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,674
I'm taking half
for setting it up.

259
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,844
O.K. With me.
I got no kick.

260
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,213
Well?

261
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,321
Well,
what's the job?

262
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,860
Noon stage to lordsburg,
tomorrow.

263
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,862
Since when
did butterfield

264
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,833
Start making
their shipments
common knowledge?

265
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,835
You know,
he's a big man.

266
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,436
He knows everything.

267
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,839
Have I ever
let you down yet?

268
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,441
That 80,000
will be there.

269
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,443
Now, between apache Wells
and lordsburg

270
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,844
Is the relay station.

271
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,446
Coach pulls in there.
They change horses.

272
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,449
Passengers get off,
eat, and rest.

273
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,451
That's when
we make our move.

274
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,854
Are you saying
we just mosey in
that way station

275
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,456
And tell them
to reach?

276
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,291
I'm saying you two
book passage

277
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,825
On that stage
for lordsburg.

278
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,828
I'll be at the way station
waiting for you.

279
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,429
Now, when everyone's
relaxing,

280
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:58,930
We hit them.

281
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,502
I don't know, vance.

282
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,504
That butterfield
don't spare anything

283
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,906
If somebody
hits their line.

284
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,908
We'll be on every
wanted poster

285
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,510
From Santa Fe
to Cheyenne.

286
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,911
Not if there aren't
any witnesses left

287
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,313
To identify us.

288
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,915
You mean
kill them all?

289
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,718
That's going
pretty far, vance.

290
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,289
We don't even know
how many there'll be
on board.

291
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,625
20 years in yuma prison
suit you better?

292
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,530
You getting soft, Jess?

293
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,465
No.

294
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,435
Not me.

295
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,871
Just slap leather
and watch them fall.

296
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,743
Killing's about
the easiest thing
there is.

297
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,554
I'm leaving now,

298
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,490
So I can be
at that way station

299
00:20:58,525 --> 00:20:59,792
When that coach rolls in.

300
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,059
I gotcha.

301
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:04,062
It's up to you
to see he stays in line.

302
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,665
Don't you
worry none.

303
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,767
Oh, I never worry
about anything.

304
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,942
You just sit down
and relax, kid.

305
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,544
You ain't going nowhere.

306
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,546
Well, you heard
the man, Jess.

307
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,948
Take it easy.

308
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,550
We got a lot
of fun ahead.

309
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:25,852
A lot of fun.

310
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,660
Whoa!

311
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:44,102
This is our
chief scout
Archie whitewater.

312
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:45,704
Did you see
anything?

313
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,105
I no say
for sure.

314
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,707
I see mescal pots.

315
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,977
Don't know how long
they been there.

316
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,544
How far west
you ride?

317
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,681
Day, day and a half.
No, two days.

318
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,352
And you didn't see
a burned-out wagon?

319
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,719
I told you.

320
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,320
I see mescal pots.

321
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,589
Nothing else.

322
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,491
No wagons.
No apache.

323
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,925
You must be blind

324
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,928
Or holed up
somewhere and slept
all the while.

325
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,931
What you got to say now,
Mr. Walker?

326
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,533
The time to start worrying

327
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,535
Is when you don't see them.

328
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,538
We'll be ready for them
when they come.

329
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:21,708
Nobody's ever ready
for the apache.

330
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,711
They'll fight you
on their own terms.

331
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,714
When you and your men
are tired enough

332
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,948
And thirsty enough

333
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,951
And far enough
away from the fort,

334
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,953
That's when you'll
find them.

335
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,555
They'll isolate
the towns.

336
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,024
They'll lead you
into an ambush.

337
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,627
You didn't learn that
at west point.

338
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,529
What do you know of that?

339
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:45,565
They've never
written a book
worth a tinker's damn

340
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,765
On how to fight apaches.

341
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,800
That's a matter
of opinion.

342
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,802
You'd better
change yours, gannon.

343
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,405
The apache can't read,

344
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,542
But he can
sure kill you.

345
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:58,545
Sergeant, send two men
out on point.

346
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,547
Have them ride
as flankers.

347
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,380
Yes, sir.

348
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,652
Yo, points out.

349
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,614
If our stage
actually leaves
on time today,

350
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,016
Somebody's likely
to drop dead from surprise.

351
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,619
It'll leave
at noon, all right,

352
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,021
But you got
to understand,
Mr. Taylor,

353
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,623
Things ain't
the same here

354
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,625
As they are
in St. Joe.

355
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,528
Here you always
got the danger
of Indians,

356
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,530
Road agents,
lord knows what all.

357
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,533
Indians, road agents,
and a dozen other excuses.

358
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,936
I'm doing the best I can
under the circumstances.

359
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,204
[Deep sigh]

360
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,939
It's a rough run.

361
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,440
I didn't become
district manager

362
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,510
Offering excuses, jace.

363
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,911
I don't think
our demands
are unreasonable.

364
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,481
But we ain't done
too bad here.

365
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:11,518
We're getting most
everything through
in good order.

366
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,920
Even
the consignments
on gold and silver

367
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,522
Have been
getting through

368
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,757
With nobody
finding out.

369
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,157
Yes, sir,
and don't forget,

370
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,760
We got
the best driver

371
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,227
In the whole
butterfield
organization,

372
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,229
Even if he is
the orneriest.

373
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,832
You mean Charley Russell?

374
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,835
He's supposed to be here
now, isn't he?

375
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,235
Well, where is he?

376
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,839
It's this sort of thing
I mean.

377
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,241
Yes, sir.
I'll... I'll speak
to Charley.

378
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,244
I guess he's out
hustling up
a fresh team.

379
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,947
Remember,
I'll be on the stage
to lordsburg,

380
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:45,951
And my report
will determine
a lot of things, jace.

381
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,953
Do I make myself clear?

382
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,955
Yes, sir,
Mr. Taylor.

383
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,957
She'll leave
on schedule,

384
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,094
Even if I have
to pull her myself.

385
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,736
[Piano plays]

386
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,707
Henry.

387
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,041
Oh, yes,
Mr. Taylor.

388
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,042
I'll be checking out
this morning.

389
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,044
Will you
see to my luggage

390
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,046
And have it
at the depot?

391
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,648
Yes, sir.
Sure will.

392
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,884
Mr. Taylor.

393
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,655
You're going to have
another...

394
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,324
How shall I say it?

395
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,560
Passenger.

396
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:28,860
Oh, who?

397
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:31,598
Janice mackenzie,
that's who.

398
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:32,998
Called herself
Hopkins here.

399
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,001
Been working
as a bookkeeper
in the bank,

400
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,605
But somebody
found out
about her past,

401
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,005
And she's
leaving town

402
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,642
On the noonday
stage

403
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,711
By request.

404
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,814
Janice mackenzie.

405
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,849
Well, no matter
what they claim
about her past,

406
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,251
She can ride butterfield,

407
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,852
Same as anyone else,

408
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,854
Long as she has
the fare.

409
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,856
I wonder why
she hid out

410
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,259
In a place like
apache Wells.

411
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,195
Well,
she'll find nothing
but contempt and scorn

412
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,797
In this territory.

413
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,199
Her reputation
goes ahead of her.

414
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,637
And lingers after.

415
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,039
I don't understand
why she bothers,

416
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,042
Unless she hopes to get
the mackenzie fortune

417
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,645
When the old woman
finally dies.

418
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,647
Oh, well.
Her worry, not mine.

419
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,749
I'll take care
your luggage.

420
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,054
Oh, Mrs. mackenzie?

421
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,090
Yes?

422
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,991
My name is Taylor.

423
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,095
I'm the district manager
for the butterfield
stage lines.

424
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,697
I understand
you're joining us

425
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,098
On the run to lordsburg.

426
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:40,633
That's right.

427
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,235
I'm sure it'll be
a pleasant journey.

428
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,671
Thank you.

429
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,840
Sheriff.

430
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,979
I... i want
a word with you.

431
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,648
Yes, ma'am, Mrs. hawkes.

432
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,082
Ladies.

433
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:01,352
What can I do for you
on this very fine day?

434
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,355
Your duty as sheriff,
Ben hall,

435
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,923
That's what...

436
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,092
By seeing to it that
that woman

437
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,096
Is on the noon stage
to lordsburg.

438
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,830
She's already been told,

439
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:14,833
But I kind of hated
to do it.

440
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:16,835
Did I hear you right?

441
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:20,239
Best be
watching our tongue
and doing our duty.

442
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,174
Do we make
ourselves clear?

443
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,442
Of course.

444
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,976
Of course,
Mrs. hawkes,

445
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:29,015
But i... i didn't mean
nothing like that.

446
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,349
I'll see she
gets out of town

447
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,851
Just as you say.

448
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,119
The sooner
the better.

449
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,422
Come, ladies.

450
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,194
Aw, miserable
old biddies.

451
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,432
Sheriff!
Sheriff, look!

452
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,033
Cavalry's coming in.

453
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,370
Look like
they've been shot up.

454
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,971
Mr. Taylor!

455
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,941
Mr. Taylor!

456
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,826
I'm sheriff hall.

457
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,062
What happened?

458
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,997
Captain gannon,
fort rocklen patrol.

459
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,398
Do you have
a doctor in town?

460
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,935
Some of my men
have been wounded.

461
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,169
Hey, Joe.

462
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,437
Yeah, sheriff.

463
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,040
Get them down
to Dr. Turner's office.

464
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,813
Tell me, captain,

465
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,815
What's been going on
around here?

466
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:37,817
Apaches ambushed us
20 Miles out.

467
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,252
Lost two men
and my sergeant.

468
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,822
I'm hoyt Taylor,
district manager
for butterfield.

469
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,825
We have a stage
going to lordsburg
at noon.

470
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:48,828
Just because
you ran into Indians
back there

471
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,831
Doesn't mean we'll
run into trouble ahead.

472
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:54,233
There'll be a heap
of trouble everywhere.

473
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:57,236
Captain, this stage
must leave for lordsburg.

474
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,839
You'll have to give us
an escort.

475
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,740
Not all the way.
Say, near the relay station.

476
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,077
We can make it
safely from there.

477
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,477
You can see
our condition.

478
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,479
If you
take that stage,

479
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,882
Do so at your
own risk.

480
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:13,351
That stagecoach
don't leave,

481
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,354
We're going to be
in a lot of trouble.

482
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,357
We'll lose
a lot of money.

483
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah, but if them apaches
is on the warpath,

484
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:24,363
I don't aim to end up
toes up to the sun

485
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,966
With a Lance
through my gizzard
for a tombstone.

486
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,968
For that kind of money,

487
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,971
I'd fight every apache
this side of hell.

488
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,140
Come on.

489
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,075
How many would you say,
captain?

490
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,478
According to Mr. Walker
and his friend,

491
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,481
We're in the middle
of an apache uprising.

492
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:44,082
What you mean,
captain?

493
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,084
What did
this hombre say?

494
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:49,087
I said
we were attacked
three times by apaches,

495
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,291
Including one attack
on a patrol.

496
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,159
That satisfy you,
friend?

497
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,561
I think we're being

498
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,563
Kind of spooked
by this drifter.

499
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,566
Now, I ain't saying
a few stray apaches

500
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,800
Didn't jump
the soldier boys,

501
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,170
Meaning no disrespect
to you, captain.

502
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,570
We rode in
last night.

503
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,439
Didn't see
any Indians.

504
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,276
Could even be
whites made up
like Indians.

505
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,878
Just like I figured.

506
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,279
Ain't nobody
but fool renegades

507
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,881
All liquored up
with firewater

508
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,884
Would be
crazy enough to
attack the cavalry.

509
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:20,018
Sheriff, have you
had any warnings

510
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,420
On injuns
on the move?

511
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,922
Why, no.

512
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,892
This is the first word
I've had of it.

513
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,293
Did you get
any of them, captain?

514
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,296
They caught us cold
coming through the pass.

515
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,298
We had to run for it.

516
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,301
Ain't nothing
but buck outlaws
on a tear.

517
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,904
If you'll excuse me,

518
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,304
I'll see to my men,

519
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,307
Have the doctor
take a look at this.

520
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,542
Captain.

521
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:46,177
Mister...

522
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,048
You sure you telling
this thing right?

523
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,051
Maybe you just seen
a little old bunch of squaws

524
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,020
Ambling by
and got scared.

525
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,023
I know an apache
when I see one,

526
00:30:57,056 --> 00:31:00,459
Especially when he's
trying to gut me open.

527
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:04,395
I don't think
you know anything.

528
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,399
You seem to be
on the prod, mister.

529
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,435
I don't know
for what reason.

530
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,037
I got troubles enough
of my own

531
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,538
Without looking
for more.

532
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,449
Hey, Mr. district manager!

533
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,051
About that coach now...

534
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,019
We're going to lordsburg.
We got guns.

535
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,422
Know how to use them
in case of trouble.

536
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,090
Y'all still going?

537
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,593
We'll be running late
if we do.

538
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,436
Kind of close
back there.

539
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,439
Little sidewinder
was about to
draw down on you.

540
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:50,442
He's looking to carve
another notch
in his gun,

541
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,044
But not at my expense.

542
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,046
I'm no gunfighter,
never have been.

543
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,148
Don't think you've seen
the last of him, son.

544
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,456
Hey, Charley!

545
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,994
Jim Walker!

546
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,428
Is that really you?

547
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,662
Yeah!

548
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,164
You still driving
for butterfield?

549
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,564
Yeah,
nigh onto 30 years.

550
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,167
Well, what happened?

551
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,568
Lose your horse
in a poker game?

552
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,171
No, he split his hoof.

553
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,572
Put that old saddle
on this horse.

554
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,409
Come with me.
I got to see jace.

555
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,710
Who's he?

556
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,313
The agent in charge.

557
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,448
Everything's
upside down around here.

558
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,716
The cavalry come in
shot full of holes.

559
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,319
They say apaches
is on the loose.

560
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,322
That shotgun
guard of mine
Chad Benson

561
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,725
Broke his leg
falling down some stairs.

562
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,160
That's mighty
inconsiderate of him.

563
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,693
Yeah.

564
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:46,197
Old bill Gibson and I
came in with that
patrol.

565
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:49,200
Bill Gibson!
In a town
full of people?

566
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,202
Where the devil
is he now?

567
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,604
He said after his bath,

568
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,606
He was going
to the palace saloon...

569
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,207
Don't say another word.

570
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,145
Soon as I find out
which way's up,

571
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,980
We'll go over
and have a drink
with him.

572
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,582
That's a deal.

573
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:13,424
Hey, jace!
Get down off of there.

574
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,527
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

575
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,432
Jace, this here's
Jim Walker.

576
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,436
Used to ride shotgun
with me on
the old yuma ride.

577
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,039
Howdy.
Glad to know you.

578
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,439
Glad to know you.

579
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,441
Know what
we're going to do?

580
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,143
Close up
at this rate.

581
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:35,047
If it ain't
Taylor on my neck,
it's Indians.

582
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:37,716
And I got nobody
to take Chad's
place.

583
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:40,719
I ain't
driving no stage
without a shotgun guard.

584
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:42,320
Pardon me, sir.

585
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,323
Could you tell me
what time the stage

586
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,725
Is going to lordsburg?

587
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,061
Ma'am, it's up
to Mr. Taylor

588
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,530
To say when
and if we go.

589
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,132
In case
you haven't heard,

590
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,134
There's hostilities
along the way,

591
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:59,270
And it'll be
a little risky
to leave right now.

592
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:00,672
I've just been told

593
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,176
It would be risky for me
if I stayed on.

594
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,814
I wonder why
she's so anxious

595
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,417
To get stuck
with an apache arrow.

596
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,420
You must be new
around here
to ask that.

597
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,422
I'm asking.

598
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:17,822
Her name's
Janice mackenzie.

599
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,824
Do I need
to say more?

600
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,427
That's
Janice mackenzie, huh?

601
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,828
I knew her husband
Bob mackenzie.

602
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,830
Sold him
some mustangs once.

603
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,833
What sort was he?

604
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,470
Well, he was
a ne'er-do-well,

605
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,207
Backed up
by his mother's money.

606
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,442
Off hand I'd say
Janice mackenzie

607
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,477
Was too much woman
for him.

608
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,878
She ain't done
nothing wrong

609
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,480
To nobody
around here,

610
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,482
But that fat sheriff
Ben hall

611
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,286
And the gossips
in this town,

612
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,854
They're going
to officially

613
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,657
Run her out of town
on the coach.

614
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,259
I ain't driving
no coach

615
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,660
Without
a shotgun guard.

616
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,662
Wait. Since my horse
is crippled,

617
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,265
I'll ride shotgun
with you to lordsburg

618
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:01,200
For the price
of a ticket.

619
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,100
That does it.

620
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,604
You put his gear
on top of that coach.

621
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,474
We're going
across the street
to the palace.

622
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:11,309
Tell Taylor
when he makes up his mind

623
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,179
What he's going
to do when,

624
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,580
Come over and get us.

625
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,182
Come on, boy.

626
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,849
* don't you cry for me

627
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,817
* for I come
from Alabama *

628
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:24,522
* with my banjo
on my knee **

629
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,861
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

630
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,329
This is, uh...

631
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,597
Uh...

632
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,865
Jim Walker.

633
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,433
Yeah.

634
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,237
Come on. Sit down
before you fall down.

635
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,638
Thank you, miss.

636
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,340
Sit down here, partner.

637
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,876
Well, I guess we're not
leaving tonight.

638
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:48,546
I couldn't
care less.

639
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,482
How about you, bill?

640
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,484
Right... right as rain,
Charley.

641
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,520
Right as rain.

642
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,426
Another bottle,
bartender!

643
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,329
Bartender,
another bottle!

644
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,834
I ain't the bartender,
mister,

645
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:12,603
But I'll give you
a little advice.

646
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,205
You better hole up

647
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,208
So them big bad injuns
don't scare you.

648
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,777
Little man,
big mouth.

649
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,851
Big man,
big gun.

650
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,719
You want
to see how big?

651
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,320
Come on, Toby.

652
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:30,722
We'll wait
at the depot.

653
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,323
Don't give me
no argument.

654
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,725
Remember what
vance said

655
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,426
About starting
another ruckus?

656
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,467
I'm going
to kill him!

657
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,868
You don't watch
your temper,

658
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,470
You'll kill
the whole deal.

659
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,871
I don't understand,
sheriff,

660
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,874
What you want
to talk to me about.

661
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,876
I'll leave when
the stage leaves.

662
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,479
There's some things
I'd like to explain.

663
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,482
If you'd just
come to my office,

664
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,983
I'll try to...

665
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:10,995
Wake up.

666
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,764
Charley.

667
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:14,999
Charley!

668
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,468
Huh?

669
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,737
I've been looking
all over for you.

670
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,339
We're leaving
for lordsburg.

671
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,341
Jace is hitching up
the horses

672
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,442
For us to leave
right away.

673
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,878
You going to be there?

674
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,282
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be there.

675
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,485
You still
with me, Jim?

676
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,986
I'm still with you.

677
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,891
Help me get bill
out of here.

678
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,895
Come on, bill,
you silly old man.

679
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,597
Oh, we had fun,
didn't we?

680
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,638
Aah!

681
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,509
Next time you lay
your hands on me,

682
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:01,447
I'll stick
that hat pin
right through you!

683
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,548
That'll be
a fair trick, lady.

684
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,854
Try and be decent
to your kind,

685
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,721
And you get assaulted.

686
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:13,324
What's the matter now?

687
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,727
[Sheriff]
Women like you
are not fit to be seen...

688
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,996
Take care of him,
Charley.

689
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,599
Say it good and loud

690
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,470
So Mrs. hawkes can hear
you're doing your work.

691
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,437
You've been warned
about making trouble.

692
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,839
As sheriff,
I'm ordering you

693
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,976
To leave on
the next stage or I'll...

694
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,577
You'll arrest me?

695
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,979
Don't worry.
I'll gladly leave.

696
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,582
The worst savage apache
on the loose

697
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,985
Is a bargain
comparitivly to most
people I've met here.

698
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,787
You've got no place
in apache Wells.

699
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,591
I'm going to make
an example of you.

700
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,594
You mean I'm not going to
hear you tell me again

701
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:53,031
That if I'm nice to you
things are going to be
nice for me?

702
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:54,833
Let me
tell you something.

703
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:58,470
You lose 100 pounds
and get yourself
a million dollars,

704
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:00,406
Because that's
the only way

705
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,340
You're ever going
to get a woman.

706
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,642
Danged if the lady
ain't right.

707
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,045
Old Ben couldn't
get into Kate's place

708
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:08,646
With a full month's pay.

709
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,649
Put an apple
in his mouth,

710
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,483
He'll look like
a roast pig.

711
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,965
Mrs. mackenzie,
we'd better head
for the stage.

712
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,503
Ah, I see Mr. Taylor
found you.

713
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,506
Well, everything's
ready to leave.

714
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,907
Where's your friend?

715
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,509
He's right
behind me.

716
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:40,512
I already got
his gear on the coach.

717
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,514
Come on.
Hurry it up.

718
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:45,517
We'll never
get out of here
at this rate.

719
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,919
Help me get old bill
on top.

720
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:50,120
I'll tie him
so he doesn't
roll off.

721
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:53,724
Leave him here
and let's go.

722
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,127
He stays, I stay.

723
00:39:57,162 --> 00:40:00,666
It's going to be
mighty rough
and mighty slow,

724
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,400
Going after dark
like this.

725
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,637
We should still reach
the relay station
by midmorning.

726
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,807
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

727
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,041
You're the one
riding shotgun?

728
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,044
I hope you don't
have to use it.

729
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,047
If you two are
coming along, climb in.

730
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,651
Don't intend
to be here all night.

731
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:20,885
Mrs. mackenzie.

732
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,054
Careful now.

733
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,658
Gentlemen.

734
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,098
Hold it!

735
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,799
Well, now,
look over there.

736
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:39,538
Looks like you
ain't leaving town
any too soon.

737
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,805
Hold it!

738
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,773
Hold that stage!

739
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,676
Hyah! Hyah!

740
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,112
Stop that coach!

741
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:50,215
That man up there
is under arrest!

742
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:57,688
Hyah!

743
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,966
What you doing,

744
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,568
Looking for Geronimo?

745
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,571
Easier to scoop up
the desert
in a tin pail

746
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:14,973
Than to
see an apache

747
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,575
When he doesn't
want you to.

748
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,477
Ohh...

749
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:25,984
What the devil's
going on here?

750
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,154
Who tied me up
like a bale of cotton?

751
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,991
Better untie him
before he gets
sunburned.

752
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,993
Who stepped
on my head?

753
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,795
Think it was a fella
by the name of John.

754
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,130
John who?

755
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,699
John barleycorn.

756
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44,735
Sure packs
a mean wallop.

757
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,137
Where's my horse?

758
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,738
Where we going?

759
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,141
Your horse
is in apache Wells.

760
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,742
Next stop is lordsburg.

761
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:53,811
Now come on!
Ha!

762
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,815
Now, what do I want to
go to lordsburg for?

763
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,517
Hyah!

764
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,963
Can't you
put that thing out?

765
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,666
It's enough to make
a person choke.

766
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,103
Hey, now, friend,

767
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:22,107
If I put my hands
around your neck
and squeeze,

768
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,710
That would choke you,
too, wouldn't it?

769
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,111
I'll have you know

770
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:28,580
I'm district manager
of butterfield lines.

771
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:30,582
Hey there,
Mr. district
manager,

772
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:33,585
Toby Jack didn't
mean no harm,
did you?

773
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:36,854
No. Here, have a drink.

774
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,789
No, thank you.

775
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:41,192
What's the matter,
Mr. district manager,

776
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,829
Our whiskey ain't
good enough for you?

777
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:48,233
Drink it before
I stick it down
your gullet.

778
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,602
Hear me now?

779
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:53,171
That's it.

780
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,641
All of it...
Down the hatch.

781
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,743
Hyah!

782
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,944
That's a good boy.

783
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,384
You... you won't
get away with this.

784
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,386
When we get
to lordsburg,

785
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,222
I'll have the marshal
jail both of you.

786
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,994
Hey there, Toby Jack.

787
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:17,294
What?

788
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,831
We ain't being
polite to the lady.

789
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,771
Here, honey.

790
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,172
How about a snort?

791
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,073
No.

792
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,343
Hey, Jack, I think
you're wasting your time.

793
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,979
She don't want
to be friendly.

794
00:43:36,446 --> 00:43:38,415
I ain't
such a bad cuss

795
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,886
Once you get
to know me.

796
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,889
I'll forgo
the pleasure
if you don't mind.

797
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,290
You can't never tell

798
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:49,026
How things are going
to work out.

799
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,427
Before this trip's over,

800
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,298
You might just
want me for a friend

801
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,900
More than anything else.

802
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:58,403
Just you wait and see
how things turn out.

803
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,042
The way
my back's crawling,

804
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,443
Feels like them apaches

805
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,379
Got us drawn
and quartered
already,

806
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:11,983
And that cargo
we got below,

807
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:13,985
Excepting for
the little lady...

808
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,253
Hah. They're
a motley crew.

809
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:19,257
Including Taylor.

810
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:30,902
I got your Winchester
in the scabbard
if you need it.

811
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,170
Hey, you!

812
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,039
Unlimber your irons.

813
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,843
Looks like we might
have trouble ahead.

814
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:43,181
Whoa!

815
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,289
Look over there.

816
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,375
By the almighty,

817
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,811
They're falling
out of the sky.

818
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,881
[Moans]

819
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,983
Well, he's
still alive.

820
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:20,385
He's pretty
busted up.

821
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,853
Wonder what
he was up to.

822
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:24,855
No good,
bet your whiskey.

823
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,857
Something must have
scared his horse,

824
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,259
And he fell off.

825
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,860
Why bother, lady?

826
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:32,030
Let the buzzards
have him.

827
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,164
Better yet...
Put a bullet in him.

828
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:35,532
It's nice and clean.

829
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:38,168
I would expect you
to say that.

830
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,170
He's just
a stinking injun.

831
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,773
What do you care?

832
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:43,775
Sure. Why waste
our time?

833
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,911
He ain't no
bother of ours.

834
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,544
Leave him be.
Let's go.

835
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:49,247
I'm afraid I agree.

836
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,118
Afraid I don't.

837
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,821
What do you mean?

838
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:58,523
This particular Indian
may be very important
to us.

839
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,990
How?

840
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:01,259
Take my word.

841
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,492
All right.

842
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,264
We can't
leave him here.

843
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,333
He'll die if we do.

844
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,801
There's no room
in the coach.

845
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:12,202
I'm not taking

846
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,005
A murderous savage
into our midst.

847
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:16,406
He's in no condition
to murder anybody.

848
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,010
Help me get him
up there.

849
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,411
I ain't riding
with no lousy
redstick.

850
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,881
Well, Sonny,

851
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,150
You just have
a nice walk.

852
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,153
The way station's
down that way
about 15 Miles.

853
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,987
You can make it easy,

854
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,590
That is, if the sun
don't get you,

855
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:35,961
Or, uh,
one of his pals.

856
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:38,429
[Taylor]
I said he's not
riding with us.

857
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,031
Didn't you hear
what I said?

858
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:43,434
Heist him on top
of the coach.

859
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,036
If it's
good enough for me,

860
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:47,438
It'll do for him.

861
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,039
Redskin.

862
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,212
May I ride with you?

863
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,582
A half-dead apache
is no worse

864
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,050
Than the company
I've kept so far.

865
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:01,386
You'd better
ride inside.

866
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:02,820
Gets hot and dusty
up there.

867
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,390
Besides,
if there's trouble,

868
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:08,359
I wouldn't want you
to get hit with
a stray bullet.

869
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,499
Come on, kid.

870
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:20,405
Hyah!

871
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,007
Hyah!

872
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,408
Get up there!

873
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:24,842
Hyah!

874
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,508
Whoa!

875
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,077
Charley!

876
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:02,179
I thought for sure
Geronimo got you
this time.

877
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:02,880
That ain't likely.

878
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,050
Well, here we are.

879
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,320
One hour stop
for victuals.

880
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,923
The food here
ain't no good,

881
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,260
And the whiskey
is pure poison.

882
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:17,561
You trying to kill us?

883
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:21,432
Sonny, you can walk
to lordsburg
if you want.

884
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:24,034
Chico!

885
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,036
Chico Lopez!

886
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:29,039
Last time I see you
was in San Antonio.

887
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,441
How you been?

888
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,042
Fine. And yourself?

889
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,444
I tell you, i...

890
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:37,048
[Moaning]

891
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:40,551
Chico, take care
of the horses.

892
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,066
[Moans]

893
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,604
That's a devil
of a note

894
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:02,540
Bringing that injun
in here just like
he's civilized.

895
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,143
It's too bad
the situation
isn't reversed.

896
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:08,013
You'd look good
staked on an ant hill.

897
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,413
I'd expect your kind

898
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,017
To take up
with an injun.

899
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,685
You open your yap
at me once more,

900
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,288
I'm going
to bat you one.

901
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:18,523
Toby Jack...

902
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,663
Why don't you just
try batting me once?

903
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,435
Don't! Unless
you think I'll
miss this close.

904
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,039
Drop it back
in the holster.

905
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:35,272
Outside.

906
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:08,738
All right,
gunfighter,

907
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,740
I've got
the advantage now,

908
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:14,211
So we'll even things
up a little bit.

909
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:18,083
Bill, throw him
your skinning knife.

910
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,484
I ain't no hand
with a knife.

911
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,152
Ain't got no chance.

912
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:25,756
A lot more chance
than you figured
to give me.

913
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,357
No, but I can't.

914
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,293
You busted my hand.

915
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:31,728
[Bill]
Too bad it wasn't
your neck.

916
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,768
Charley, keep that till
we get to lordsburg.

917
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:42,140
Suppose we're
jumped by apaches.

918
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:43,440
Well, Sonny,

919
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:46,343
I'll just keep it
for you till then.

920
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,116
You got
anything to say?

921
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:54,552
Not with that gun
pressing into
my backbone.

922
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,322
Drop it, bill.

923
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,060
How about now?

924
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,465
Nah.

925
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,733
I got no quarrel
with you,

926
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:13,571
But Toby Jack ain't
likely to forget
what you done.

927
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,705
He'd better not,

928
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,475
'Cause next time

929
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,843
I'll step
on your neck.

930
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,795
[Moaning]

931
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:50,241
You, you
in charge here?

932
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:52,842
Si, señor, I am
the boss man here,

933
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:54,444
I think.

934
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,845
This place
is disgraceful.

935
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,448
What does butterfield
pay you for anyhow,

936
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:00,850
To sit around
and do nothing?

937
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:03,120
Sometimes nothing
is very hard to do.

938
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,857
If nothing else,
get us some food.

939
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,426
Si. Si, señor.

940
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:18,402
[Bottle crashes]

941
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:25,876
You're never going
to learn, are you?

942
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,646
You're lucky he
didn't knock your head
clear off.

943
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,881
Why didn't you
lend a hand?

944
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,684
You always said you
never needed no help.

945
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:35,820
Where the devil
is vance?

946
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,688
Maybe
because we were late,

947
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:40,557
He figured something
went wrong and took off.

948
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,958
Tell you one thing...

949
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:45,263
I don't aim to try it
without him.

950
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:52,803
Here you are, bill.

951
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,441
Chico...

952
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,444
You make the worst grub
I ever ate.

953
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,447
Now get behind the bar
and start pouring.

954
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,550
Charley, you always
say the same thing
about my cooking,

955
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,586
But I notice you had
three helpings.

956
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:09,853
Ay, caramba!

957
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:12,856
Russell, take one drink
while on a run,

958
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,458
And it's your job.

959
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:15,859
I'm warning you.

960
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,595
Oh, I see.

961
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:20,865
Uh, chico,
make that a double.

962
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:24,834
As of now,
I quit butterfield.

963
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,836
Mr. Taylor
will drive you

964
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:29,673
The rest of the way
to lordsburg.

965
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:34,279
If you intend to
work for butterfield,

966
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:36,847
You'd better do
as I say.

967
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,850
I don't intend to
work for butterfield.

968
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,651
I quit.

969
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,254
Didn't you hear me?

970
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:45,955
Well, uh, perhaps
I was a bit hasty.

971
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,458
This has been a most
arduous journey,

972
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:50,227
What with everything
happening.

973
00:53:51,496 --> 00:53:53,697
[Moaning]

974
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,804
What are we
going to do
about the Indian?

975
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,406
We'll leave him.

976
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:03,240
He'll get along
somehow.

977
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,409
After all,
what did they do

978
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,711
Before the white man
came along?

979
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,713
Probably a great
deal better.

980
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,717
I'd like to get
some fresh air.

981
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,485
Would you
join me?

982
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:15,885
Yes, of course.

983
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,322
Thank you.

984
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:32,837
I'm beholden to you,
Mr. Walker.

985
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,439
Twice
you've helped me,

986
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:37,442
And I've not
thanked you yet.

987
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:38,675
No need.

988
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,848
What are you
thinking about?

989
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:47,452
How beautiful you are

990
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,554
And yet how sad.

991
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,459
Do you know
who I am

992
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:57,462
And what they
say about me?

993
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,863
Well, what people say

994
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,865
Isn't really important.

995
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:02,467
Oh, yes, it is.

996
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,969
You've got to
live with people.

997
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,473
Did you know
my husband?

998
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:11,475
Yes, I knew him,

999
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,977
But what
I don't know

1000
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,346
Is how a woman
like you

1001
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:18,616
Ever married
a man like him.

1002
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,918
I met Bob
in new Orleans.

1003
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,520
We were married
four weeks later

1004
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:24,922
After a whirlwind
courtship.

1005
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,492
There was only
one little detail

1006
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:28,958
Bob didn't tell me...

1007
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:32,830
His mother had
other arrangements
for him.

1008
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,132
Her arrangement
was Maria delgado,

1009
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:37,868
Whose family in Mexico

1010
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:41,872
Is as rich
as maude is here.

1011
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:45,675
A wedding was planned...
Not mine.

1012
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,076
And by marrying you

1013
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:50,481
He, uh... Upset
the apple cart.

1014
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:53,717
Maria delgado put on
her wedding dress.

1015
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,487
She went to church,

1016
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,889
Prayed...

1017
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:02,560
And then killed herself
on the altar.

1018
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,898
Well...

1019
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:10,501
Sometimes pride
can be a...

1020
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,670
A terrible thing.

1021
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,672
She was
five months' pregnant

1022
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,474
With my husband's child.

1023
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:22,579
Maria's father
and two brothers
swore vengeance,

1024
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:24,915
And maude and I
watched

1025
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:27,918
As they rode up
to the house

1026
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:30,888
And killed Bob
right before our eyes,

1027
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:34,625
And then they rode away
without a word.

1028
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,026
In her grief,

1029
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,129
She... she turned
against me, and...

1030
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:43,867
Naturally, she didn't
tell the whole story.

1031
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,869
She felt that...

1032
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,872
That if I hadn't
married Bob,

1033
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,476
None of this
would have happened.

1034
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:54,479
Well, by the time
she was finished,

1035
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:57,881
I was a marked woman
in the whole territory.

1036
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,085
I bear the mark of Cain
wherever I go.

1037
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,420
Then why
do you stay on?

1038
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,223
Because I didn't
do anything wrong,

1039
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:11,496
And I will not
lower myself
to that indignity.

1040
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,498
Now, she made me run,

1041
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,965
And she made me cry,

1042
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,703
But no one else
ever will.

1043
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,658
[Horse approaches]

1044
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,138
There was
an apache war scare.

1045
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,006
We was worried
about you.

1046
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,608
Where you been?

1047
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:59,977
Up on the Ridge
watching things
down here.

1048
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,277
Everything set?

1049
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,980
They're all inside.

1050
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,291
What happened to...

1051
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,893
Where's your gun?

1052
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,294
He smarted off again,

1053
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,896
And some fella inside
whomped him good,

1054
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,298
Took his gun away.

1055
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:22,899
Give him yours.

1056
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,301
Get that shotgun.

1057
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,303
[Thunder rolls]

1058
00:58:26,335 --> 00:58:28,673
There's a storm
coming in.

1059
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,139
Saw it
from the Ridge.

1060
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:36,980
Hey, I just seen
an Indian up there.

1061
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,585
You see anything?

1062
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:42,587
No, I don't
see nothing.

1063
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,987
He don't, either.

1064
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,256
He just
been drinking too much.

1065
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,994
All right,
let's go.

1066
00:58:59,804 --> 00:59:02,172
It's about time
we get rolling.

1067
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:05,042
I'll go rustle up
the other two
passengers.

1068
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:06,644
Uh... uh, not yet.

1069
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,778
We haven't
been here an hour.

1070
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:10,047
Butterfield always...

1071
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,648
Don't anybody move!

1072
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,583
Heist 'em high.

1073
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:19,322
I ain't got
no gun, Sonny.

1074
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,326
Who is she?

1075
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,062
Well, that's
Janice mackenzie.

1076
00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:27,064
You've heard
of her before,

1077
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:29,667
And this one here
is the one

1078
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,267
That cuffed
Toby Jack around.

1079
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,269
How big you feel now?

1080
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,740
About the same size
you would

1081
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:38,007
If you didn't
have that Cannon.

1082
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,010
I don't know whether
I'll give him to you
or not, Toby Jack.

1083
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,912
Oh, shut up.

1084
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,982
I'll tell you
what to do and when.

1085
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,354
Long time, Walker.

1086
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,657
Long time.

1087
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:55,324
You know him
from somewhere?

1088
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,294
I know him.

1089
00:59:57,326 --> 00:59:59,062
Hey, you.

1090
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,265
You run this place?

1091
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:02,867
Si. Si, señor.

1092
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:03,600
What about him?

1093
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,372
Found him on the trail.

1094
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:12,342
She insisted
we bring him along.

1095
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:13,777
Say, vance,

1096
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,913
This one's been
nursemaiding that bag

1097
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,313
All the way here.

1098
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,749
What you got there?

1099
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:22,419
Nothing. Just some
extra clothes.

1100
01:00:22,451 --> 01:00:26,123
No use playacting
anymore, Taylor.

1101
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:29,258
Give Jess the cash.

1102
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,661
Well, Charley,

1103
01:00:30,695 --> 01:00:32,429
Looks like
the stage line

1104
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:37,033
Is going to give
Mr. Taylor a bonus
this year.

1105
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:40,304
You mean to say
I've been working
for a crook?

1106
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,907
Toby Jack,
you and Jess don't think

1107
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,776
I just chanced to pick
that particular coach?

1108
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,178
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

1109
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,378
Right, Taylor?

1110
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:51,916
Fool! Why did
you tell them?

1111
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:53,317
Why, you mangy toad.

1112
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:55,920
You was with them
all the time.

1113
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,923
That's why you wanted
to leave apache Wells
and get here.

1114
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:01,859
My boys didn't know
about you, Taylor,

1115
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:05,162
But, of course, you
didn't know about them.

1116
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:10,099
Well, boy, I sure
got to hand it
to you, vance.

1117
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:13,369
I didn't know
he was one of us.

1118
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,973
Do you realize
what you've done?

1119
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,474
I'm ruined, finished.

1120
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,344
Now I'll have to
go on the run

1121
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,346
With you
and those two

1122
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,281
Because you talked.

1123
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,816
Taylor, you won't have
to run anyplace.

1124
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,354
No?

1125
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:31,955
Well, what about them?

1126
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:33,357
Think they'll keep still

1127
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,860
Once they get
to lordsburg?

1128
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,962
He's real funny,
ain't he?

1129
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,865
They don't need you
anymore, Taylor.

1130
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,165
Shut your mouth.

1131
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:46,971
Well, it's...

1132
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,740
It's done now.

1133
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:52,376
Let's divide
the money.

1134
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,979
40,000 each, vance.

1135
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,981
Those two
are your lookout.

1136
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:01,084
He still don't
get it, do he?

1137
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,486
And they don't, either,

1138
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:06,090
And they're going to
be just as dead as...

1139
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,957
He is.

1140
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:14,998
No, vance, not...

1141
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:17,266
Not me.

1142
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,770
I... i set this thing
up for you.

1143
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:21,038
Without me,

1144
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,007
You'd never have
been able to do it.

1145
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:26,410
Look...
I'll do it for you.

1146
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,011
I'll kill them!

1147
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,413
Every one of them!

1148
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,948
Then it won't be
on your head.

1149
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,351
I'll be in it
with you!

1150
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:35,953
Please don't kill me!

1151
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,788
Please, vance!

1152
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:39,023
Please, vance!

1153
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,891
[Gunshots]

1154
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:52,235
You're next, mister.

1155
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,070
Don't get itchy.

1156
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,909
Get him out of here.

1157
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,984
You see, Jim,

1158
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:09,385
I just saved your life.

1159
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:12,989
That Toby Jack,
he's a mean one.

1160
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:16,160
He wants to
nail your hide
to the wall.

1161
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:19,129
Ha ha ha ha!

1162
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,241
I've lived among injuns
most of my life,

1163
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,044
Pretty near,

1164
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:37,948
But I'm glad to say
that I've never
seen this buck

1165
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:39,349
Except from a distance.

1166
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:42,386
That's why
I'm here now.

1167
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:43,988
What's he saying?

1168
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:47,256
You have any idea
who that is?

1169
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,859
That there apache

1170
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:50,928
Is none other
than antone,

1171
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:53,898
Chief of the tontos.

1172
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,867
Madre de dios.

1173
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,335
You're lying.

1174
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:00,437
Bet you wish I was.

1175
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:04,975
Chico... What about it?

1176
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,576
No! No!

1177
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:12,381
Bill is right.

1178
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:15,384
His people will
burn down this place

1179
01:04:15,419 --> 01:04:17,386
And kill all of us

1180
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:19,656
If they know
he is here.

1181
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,257
That's
what you meant

1182
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,527
When you said
he was special.

1183
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,396
There's more than likely
apaches looking for him.

1184
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,998
Vance, we don't
stand a chance

1185
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:32,036
With that many
apaches out there.

1186
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:36,239
So, the great hunter
is now the hunted.

1187
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,977
Ohh.

1188
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,445
Maybe it's a trick.

1189
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:45,382
Maybe they're just
making it up
to stay alive.

1190
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:48,953
I told you I seen
an Indian out there.

1191
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:50,955
I had a partner once

1192
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:54,357
Who got caught by some
of victorio's
mescaleros.

1193
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,293
They staked him out
on an ant hill.

1194
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:58,996
They slit his eyelids

1195
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:02,032
And let nature
take its course.

1196
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,900
No mescalero living
can match a Tonto

1197
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,603
When it comes
to meanness.

1198
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,504
[Thunder rolls]

1199
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,385
Well, that's better.

1200
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,362
Vance, I ain't never
seen it this bad before.

1201
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,365
Let's get it done
and clear out
while we can.

1202
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:39,368
How far do you
think you'd get
in this storm?

1203
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,371
I'd take my chances
with the storm

1204
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,173
Against apaches
any day.

1205
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:01,324
Well...

1206
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,960
Looks like
you've reached
an impasse, vance.

1207
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,729
Those apaches know
antone's in here,

1208
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:10,334
And you know
Tonto apaches
are the worst kind.

1209
01:06:10,367 --> 01:06:11,735
They're the meanest.

1210
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,337
They'll just wait.

1211
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:16,206
When you
step outside, you
won't get 10 feet.

1212
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:18,775
Keep talking.

1213
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,376
You need us, vance.

1214
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,778
You need us bad,

1215
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,481
And you need us
alive.

1216
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,450
Now you've got,
uh, three guns.

1217
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:31,320
Add us to it,
that makes eight,
including the woman.

1218
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:34,558
Wouldn't you say
that stacks up
a lot better?

1219
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:37,094
You'd fight apaches,
that's for sure.

1220
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:40,097
Then me and the boys
would be outnumbered,

1221
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,666
And we'd have to fight
you for the 80,000.

1222
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,169
Of course you can
always kill us.

1223
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:47,171
Try and
make a run for it...
beat the storm.

1224
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:48,705
[Thunder]

1225
01:06:48,737 --> 01:06:51,807
Ain't no storm
can keep the apache
off your tracks

1226
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,811
Once he's got your scent,
and they got wind of you.

1227
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:59,415
They just trying
to spook us to get
the guns back.

1228
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:01,285
Let's kill them all now

1229
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:05,421
And clear out of here
while we got half a chance.

1230
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:08,292
First, vance, how
about a little favor?

1231
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:09,692
What favor?

1232
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,161
This woman.

1233
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,695
I want her.

1234
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,797
At a time like...

Well, about...

1286
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:51,815
About six years ago,
there was a...

1287
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,817
There was
a wagon train

1288
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,819
Out of St. Joe,
Missouri...

1289
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:57,620
That was ambushed.

1290
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:01,990
Every man,
woman, and child
was killed.

1291
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:04,260
Well, they thought
the kiowas did it,

1292
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,497
So they sent the army
out to punish them.

1293
01:11:08,532 --> 01:11:11,934
There was a lot of gold
on that wagon train.

1294
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,503
It never turned up.

1295
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:15,471
Gold?
Yeah.

1296
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,508
Now you know the Indians
don't use gold,

1297
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:22,044
So one of the relatives
had me investigate.

1298
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:24,648
It seems the, uh...

1299
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,851
Wagon master
was strangely missing.

was vance Buckner.

1303
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,797
It took me almost a year.

1304

I finally caught up
to him and
brought him in.

You... you brought
vance in?

1306
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:49,839
He went before judge
Isaac Parker for trail.

Yup.

Well, the judge
didn't hold with murder,

So he sentenced him
to hang.

1311
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:04,320
Now, one of
the kiowa survivors
was in the courtroom,

1312
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,692

and slashed his face
with a knife.

1410
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:31,868
If you try to burn
the station down,
they'll kill him.

1411
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,269
I have an idea.

1412
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:35,872
Maybe I can
help save him,

1413
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:39,442
So he can die
among his own people.

1414
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,062
Vance! Can you hear me?

1415
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,464
[Vance]
My gun's pointed
at your belly.

1416
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,466
If I shoot,
you're dead.

1417
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:04,800
Don't be a fool.

1418
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,136
Hear me out.

1419
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,340
What do you want?

1420
01:20:11,374 --> 01:20:13,341
I want to give you
a chance...

1421
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:15,944
A better chance than
you figured to give us.

1422
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,947
Your friends in here
haven't got a chance.

1423
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:20,348
Turn them loose...

1424
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:21,617
Unharmed.

1425
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:23,218
You think I'm crazy?

1426
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,922
They're my insurance
to get out of here.

1427
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:27,155
Vance!

1428
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:29,058
They'll burn you out!

1429
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:32,929
Do what he says,
vance.

1430
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,596
Anything's better
than this.

1431
01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:42,637
I can't put them off
much longer!

1432
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:44,340
What's your deal?

1433
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:45,875
Turn them loose,

1434
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,376
Throw your guns away,

1435
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,979
Come out
with your hands up.

1436
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:52,348
All we'd get
is a rope.

1437
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:53,950
Either way
we're dead.

1438
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:55,351
I'll make the deal.

1439
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:57,954
Take it,
or we kill them.

1440
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,989
It makes
no difference now.

1441
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:02,959
All right.
What is it?

1442
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:04,393
We let them loose.

1443
01:21:04,427 --> 01:21:06,394
You bring our two horses

1444
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:08,396
This side of the coach.

1445
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:10,366
We keep our guns.

1446
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,403
Well, you heard him.

1447
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,375
I do not care
about them.

1448
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,978
I only care for my chief.

1449
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,379
We are agreed.

1450
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:25,080
[Vance]
What about it?

1451
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:28,083
All right, vance,

1452
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:31,387
But then I'm coming
after you...

1453
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,654
Alone.

1454
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:34,289
I hope so, bucko.

1455
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:35,992
I just hope you do.

1456
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:37,292
Cut them loose.

1457
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,405
All right, you two,

1458
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:51,373
Carry him out.

1459
01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:56,112
Oh!

1460
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,196
Is that
butterfield money?

1461
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,398
Yeah.

1462
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,132
[Walker]
Leave it there.

1463
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,635
Nothing said about that.

1464
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,006
You're coming after us.

1465
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:24,406
You can take it then.

1466
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,042
If you think
you can.

1467
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:41,657
Ay, chihuahua.

1468
01:22:41,689 --> 01:22:44,593
Gracias, señor.
Gracias.

1469
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:46,595
Chico, get me a horse.

1470
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,597
Si, hombre,
como no.

1471
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,099
I never thought
I'd see the day

1472
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:53,502
When I'd be glad
to see apaches.

1473
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:57,106
The truce is
only until sundown.

1474
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:00,976
I do not wish to see
any of you again.

1475
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,415
Oh, Jim... Jim,

1476
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:08,016
According
to that apache,

1477
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:09,752
You only got
till sundown.

1478
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:11,354
All right.

1479
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:14,422
He's a good one.
Plenty tough in the desert.

1480
01:23:14,457 --> 01:23:17,092
Charley,
you take care of her.

1481
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,294
Hyah!

1482
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,386
[Gunshot]

1483
01:23:45,753 --> 01:23:47,389
[Gunshot]

1484
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:31,567
Hyah!

1485
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:33,895
[Gunshot]

1486
01:25:48,976 --> 01:25:51,247
All right, hold it.

1487
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:56,419
Come on down.

1488
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:54,676
[Shouting in apache]

1489
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:57,945
[Speaking apache]

1490
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,690
Why did you not
kill him?

1491
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:09,925
I'll take him back
to town.

1492
01:27:09,957 --> 01:27:12,861
The white man's
law'll hang him.

1493
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:16,231
No. He will
stay with us.

1494
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:21,869
Take his horse.

1495
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:24,273
The truce
is till sundown.

1496
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,683
Walker!

1497
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:37,886
You're not
going to leave me?

1498
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,028
Walker!

1499
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:52,301
Walker!

1500
01:27:52,335 --> 01:27:53,936
Walker!

1501
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:24,099
Well, bill won't mind.

1502
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:28,471
He knew every foot
of this territory.

1503
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:31,540
The only place
he ever called home.

1504
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:37,712
Antone died
just after you left.

1505
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:40,949
They picked him up
and rode away.

1506
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,852
Stage leaves for
lordsburg in 10 minutes.

1507
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:46,554
You two
still going with us?

1508
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:54,696
Well, it's a start.
