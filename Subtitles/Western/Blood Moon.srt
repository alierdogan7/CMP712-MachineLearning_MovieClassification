1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,354
- Pete, ol' pal...

2
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,890
we've been together a long time.

3
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,085
This is where we say goodbye.

4
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,019
I just can't see
you suffer no more.

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,829
So long, partner.

6
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,007
It'll be getting
dark soon, Pete.

7
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,644
I best find me some place
to bed down for the night.

8
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,425
- Blasted coyotes.

9
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,898
Thought I'd scared
them off yesterday.

10
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,174
You varmints, let's
get a good look at you.

11
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,980
Don't come back, you bastards!

12
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,984
Hush now.

13
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:50,959
It's just a rat.

14
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,739
Looking for somewhere
warm to sleep.

15
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,440
When the stage
gets here tomorrow,

16
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,078
you gotta be fresh and strong.

17
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,012
40 miles from here to Lassiter.

18
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,385
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!

19
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,303
- Right, you
put your hands up,

20
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,779
and you don't do anything
stupid now, you hear?

21
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,043
- I'm gonna
ask you gentlemen

22
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,049
to put all your
money on the counter.

23
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,881
- Sure.

24
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,714
- Now, move it!

25
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,221
- Keep your
powder dry, Jeb.

26
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,088
We've got it, come on, let's go.

27
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,090
- What you
looking at, little boy?

28
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,090
Damn it, come on!

29
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,722
- What are you looking at?

30
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,767
Face the other way if you
know what's good for you!

31
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,128
Now let's get out of here!

32
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,145
- You alright, Lloyd?

33
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,281
- Hurts like hell,
but I'll live.

34
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,086
- Grab him, doc.

35
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,627
- Aw,jeez
they got Van Corren.

36
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,657
That's a damn shame.

37
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,394
- The bullet's
gone clean through.

38
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,726
- Did you see who it was?

39
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,165
- No, but
one of them said,

40
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,765
“you gotta keep your
powder dry, Jeb",

41
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,640
has to be the Norton brothers.

42
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,337
- Don’t jump
to conclusions, Lloyd.

43
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,005
There's more than one
Jeb in these parts.

44
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,105
- I've got a cousin
Jeb, in Denver.

45
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,116
And your brother's name
is Jeb, ain't it Lloyd?

46
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,252
- I'm telling you, it was them.

47
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,118
They've robbed five
banks already this year.

48
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,624
Was only a matter of
time till they hit mine.

49
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,819
- Well, looks like
they headed north.

50
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,224
There's a good chance
they'll bump into the coach.

51
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,092
- The one Jake's on?

52
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,130
- Yeah.

53
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,461
- I'll take you
down to my office.

54
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,029
- They were riding hard.

55
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,505
They're gonna need
fresh horses soon.

56
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,599
- Only one place
they'll find them.

57
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,811
- Palm Flats.

58
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:19,369
- Palm Flats.

59
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,164
- Pardon
my curiosity but,

60
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,705
is that wedding ring new?

61
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,401
- Me and Jake just got married
in Durango, four days ago.

62
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,177
We've only known each
other three weeks.

63
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,111
- I was attending a trial.

64
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,180
- Jake's deputy
marshal of Lassiter.

65
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,546
- First day in town, met
Sarah, we got talking,

66
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,641
and well, here we are.

67
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,188
- You must be some
talker, mister.

68
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,519
- And now I'm Mrs. Jake Norman.

69
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,957
- I have a weakness
for pretty rings.

70
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,362
- Is that Mexican silver?

71
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,758
- Yes, indeed.

72
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,959
My husband gave it
to me as a present,

73
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,502
the day we opened the
Golden Garter in Lednam.

74
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,163
- You run a saloon?

75
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,141
- Dan said they'd look after me.

76
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,972
- Your husband must be
a very generous man.

77
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,740
- Excuse me, Mr. Norman?

78
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,541
- Jake, you can call me Jake.

79
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,207
- Jake, I'm a reporter.

80
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,411
- You seem a little young
for a newspaper man, mister?

81
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,215
- Henry Lester, with
the London Times.

82
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,382
I'm writing a series of
articles about the wild west.

83
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,085
I'd like to ask
you a few questions

84
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,217
about being a deputy marshal.

85
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,784
- Sure.

86
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,726
- Right, here we go.

87
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,787
How many men have you shot?

88
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,394
- Put the book away, Henry.

89
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,267
Jake's on his honeymoon.

90
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,302
- Have you ever
visited Lassiter?

91
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,475
- It ain't much more
than a one-horse town.

92
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,344
And they shot that
horse 20 years ago.

93
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,315
- Jake tells me it's a
wonderful place to setup home.

94
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,688
- Do you believe
everything he tells you?

95
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,754
- Well, Sarah and me
don't have any secrets.

96
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,526
Do we darling?

97
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,289
- Will your husband be
meeting you in Denver?

98
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,263
- Dan died three years ago.

99
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,225
But I still call myself
Mrs. Marie Cooper.

100
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,264
And I miss him every day.

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,933
- I'm sorry.

102
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,305
- We had eleven years together.

103
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,645
That's more that some.

104
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,275
- Sorry folks!

105
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,648
- Hey Yancy, you
told me you have

106
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,185
the most comfortable
stages in the west.

107
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,256
- Well, we do Jake.

108
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,285
But this here,
ain't one of them!

109
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,851
Ho-ha.yo!

110
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,927
- You see him Yancy?

111
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,302
- You think I'm blind?

112
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,568
- I don't know.

113
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,800
- Stage line don't
pay me to stop,

114
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,365
for no cowboy, down on his luck.

115
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,316
- Don't worry, father.

116
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,759
I'll protect you.

117
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,498
- Well, you got
me to stop, stranger.

118
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,038
State your business.

119
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,163
- My name's Calhoun and I'd
like to board your stage,

120
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,066
if there's room.

121
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,371
- Where's your horse?

122
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,880
- Broke his leg yesterday.

123
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,243
- You shoot him?

124
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,612
- No, I wrestled him to the
ground and beat him to death.

125
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,176
- Now, now.

126
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,778
There's no need to
be disrespectful.

127
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,652
Especially when you got
a shotgun pointed at you.

128
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,385
- Apologies, gentlemen,
where you headed?

129
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,620
- We're going to Pine
Flats in a couple hours,

130
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,857
get fresh horses and
then on to Denver.

131
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,365
- Denver, huh?

132
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,594
I've never been there.

133
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,191
- Well, you wanna put that
right, fa re's six dollars.

134
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,364
- Six, you only charge four--

135
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,770
- Would you shut up?

136
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,807
- I'll give you one
dollar now in good faith,

137
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,468
and the rest when
you get me to Denver.

138
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,238
Whoa, easy.

139
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,683
- Alright, sling
your stuff up on top.

140
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,789
Get yourself inside.

141
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:37,560
- Name's Calhoun
and I'd appreciate

142
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,435
you holstering those guns.

143
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,451
Anyone mind if I?

144
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,145
- Where you from, Calhoun?

145
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,491
- Well, I'd tell you but,

146
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,625
you'd never have heard of it.

147
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,091
- Next stop, Pine Flats.

148
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,471
- Tick-tock,
tick-tock Ahiga.

149
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,636
What have you got for me?

150
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,304
Don't make me wait all day.

151
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,177
- I got four.

152
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,715
- Ah-ha, well
that's not gonna scare me off.

153
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,475
I raise you four.

154
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,992
Beat that.

155
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,497
Show me what you got.

156
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,192
- Full house.

157
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:21,071
- Ahiga, you're a
low-down, cheating snake.

158
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,135
- If you were a man,
I'd cut your heart out,

159
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,338
you half-breed bitch!

160
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,650
- If you were a man, you
wouldn't cheat at cards,

161
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,516
you skunk-breath toad,
and your wife told me

162
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,953
you were a lousy lover.

163
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,993
- Not again.

164
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,553
- Antahini, antahini!

165
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,674
- Causing trouble
again, Black Deer?

166
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,302
- Join me fora drink, marshal?

167
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,742
- There's a saloon
down the street.

168
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,540
- I prefer to do my
drinking in here.

169
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,710
- And your gambling,
and your fighting.

170
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,116
- Joanie Loumis don't
mind, do you Joanie?

171
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,586
- I've always been willing to
do business with the Indians.

172
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,454
- That may be so, but I
don't want to catch you

173
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,654
serving that girl whiskey again.

174
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,559
- Hey, what are you my father?

175
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,120
- You've got no right
talking to me like that.

176
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,097
- I got every right.

177
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,565
- What the hell's got
into you today, Wade?

178
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,933
- I just got back from telling
Jenny Corbin she's a widow.

179
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,631
Got any coffee on the stove?

180
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,110
- Coffee?

181
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,234
Yeah, I'll bring you a cup.

182
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,643
- Bring me the
pot, and two cups.

183
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,149
- Coming right up.

184
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,651
Navajo hate coffee.

185
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,918
Prefer firewater.

186
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,691
Taste good.

187
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,391
- Guess you heard
about the robbery.

188
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,530
- Yeah everyone's saying
it was the Nortons.

189
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,867
- Yeah, no one's
willing to form a posse.

190
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,335
Drink it, all of it.

191
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,342
- Loumis, where'd
you find this coffee?

192
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,749
Up the rear end of a buffalo?

193
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,410
- I said drink it.

194
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,111
I need your help, Black Deer.

195
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,813
I'll pay you 10 dollars.

196
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,616
- And a bottle of whiskey.

197
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,021
- Alright.

198
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,183
But until those outlaws
are behind bars,

199
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,890
coffee's the only thing
you'll be drinking.

200
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,192
What do you say?

201
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,962
- I'll give it
some consideration.

202
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,159
- Well,
don't wait too long.

203
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,302
I'm intent on riding out soon.

204
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,033
- Then I
need to tell you about

205
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,333
the dream-vision
I had last night.

206
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,467
- Been a while since you
bored me about one of those.

207
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,541
- An
evil Navajo spirit,

208
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,706
a creature that kills in
the light of the blood moon,

209
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,715
yee naaldlooshi.

210
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,981
- A skin-walker?

211
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,319
That's just legend.

212
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,018
- It's more than legend,Wade.

213
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,924
They're real, and
they're out there.

214
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,692
- I don't suppose
you've ever seen one?

215
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,799
- Well, would you believe
me if l said I had?

216
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,268
A skin-walker is
a Navajo warrior,

217
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,837
banished from their
tribe, for learning

218
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,396
the forbidden secret
of shape-shifting into,

219
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,498
god dammit Wade,
you're looking at me

220
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,668
like I've been chewing peyote.

221
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,178
The time of the blood
moon is almost upon us,

222
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,714
when skin-walkers are
at their strongest.

223
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,213
Heed my warning.

224
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,716
Delay your search
for a few days.

225
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,620
- You got your personal beliefs.

226
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,357
But I got my duties to perform.

227
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,724
Shit, I'll ride out alone.

228
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:42,767
- I'll be in your office in
an hour, ready to ride out.

229
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,576
You got any silver bullets?

230
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,151
- On my wage?

231
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,548
Hell no, why?

232
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,555
- It's a question that
needed to be asked.

233
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,297
- Welcome to Mud
Flats!

234
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,899
Pine Flats, we're stopping
here for a couple hours.

235
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,812
- Wish it was a couple days,
my backside's sore as hell.

236
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,807
- Charlie!

237
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,081
Charlie be fixing
biscuits, coffee,

238
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,746
if he's a mind to.

239
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,655
- Hey, save me
some of them biscuits.

240
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,892
I'm gonna deal with the horses.

241
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,417
- I'll wait out here,
if you don't mind.

242
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,328
I've never been inside
a saloon in my life.

243
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,765
- Oh, no, there ain't
been a saloon here since

244
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,826
the silver mine closed
down, everybody left town.

245
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,564
- Oh, I assumed the
townspeople were all in church.

246
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,771
- Pine Flat's
citizens aren't the

247
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,778
church-going kind, if
you get my meaning.

248
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,712
- Drunken miners is all some
of them gals really are.

249
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,408
- Some of them girls
are real pretty.

250
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,179
- It's like a ghost-town.

251
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,843
- Not quite, Charlie
Packham stayed on,

252
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,285
working for the stage-line.

253
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,790
- Oh yeah, sure did, he's
got himself a room upstairs.

254
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,986
Got it nice and cozy too.

255
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,084
- Cozy isn't a word I'd
use to describe this place.

256
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,689
- Maybe it just needs
a woman's touch.

257
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,325
- Yeah, a woman with
a box of dynamite.

258
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,797
- Charlie, the old
coot, losing his mind.

259
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,537
Left the lamps on in the
middle of the daytime.

260
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,349
Charlie!

261
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,821
You got customers down here!

262
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,831
- Maybe he's out back.

263
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,834
- He still should've heard us.

264
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,597
- That doorway lead outside?

265
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,202
- Yeah, through the kitchen.

266
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,111
- Shall I take a look or...

267
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,341
- No, you best keep the
preacher and the ladies company.

268
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,380
- What's going on,Jake?

269
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,681
- Nothing darling,
just stay here.

270
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,133
- Spread out.

271
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,925
- Over Here!

272
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,936
- Jesus wept...

273
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,704
- That Charlie?

274
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,939
- What's left of him.

275
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,905
- I guess we'll be
making our own coffee.

276
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,914
- What in God's name did that?

277
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,111
- God was looking the other
way, when this happened.

278
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,455
The liver's been torn out.

279
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,785
- And how is it you know
about livers and such, hmm?

280
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,261
You a doctor?

281
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,927
" Grizzly?

282
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,200
- No, this ain't from a grizzly.

283
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,442
You familiar with
Indian legends?

284
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,680
- Sure, I heard of a few.

285
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,989
Now wait a minute--

286
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,587
- Name me one critter
capable of doing that.

287
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,491
- Had to be a wolf pack.

288
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,497
- Now that figures.

289
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,896
Yeah, when they get hungry,
they get real vicious.

290
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,933
- Real clever too.

291
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,298
Didn't leave one
paw print behind.

292
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,140
Best get the old man buried.

293
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,007
- Well, Charlie
keeps, kept tools,

294
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,504
upstairs in the store-room.

295
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,879
Bound to be a
spade or something.

296
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,961
- Still loaded.

297
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,055
He didn't get a chance to
fire at what came after him.

298
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,730
- It had to be a
wolf pack, right?

299
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,402
- I'll be mighty
relieved if it was.

300
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:15,735
Yancy tell you what
happened to Charlie?

301
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,037
- Not in great detail, no.

302
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,738
- Was it an accident?

303
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,047
- Hardly.

304
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,105
- Indians?

305
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,783
- Most likely a wolf pack.

306
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,982
- Might they still be around?

307
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,320
- I'd like to take a look at
the body before it's interred.

308
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:37,052
- l wouldn’t
advise that if I were you.

309
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,120
- But it would add so much
more color to my articles.

310
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,066
- Henry, the only
color you'll find,

311
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,499
out there, is bright red.

312
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,107
- Well, better
get Glen from the livery.

313
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:09,227
- Now'd be a good time

314
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,160
to say a few words, preacher.

315
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,094
- Yes, of course.

316
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,292
Most of us here, didn't know...

317
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,269
- Charlie Packham.

318
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,038
- Charlie Packham, but
Yancy and Glen tell me

319
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,106
he was a decent fellow,

320
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,615
who provided
sustenance for weary...

321
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,445
- Preacher?

322
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,222
- I thought I saw someone,

323
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,952
standing by a tree.

324
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,018
- Stay out
west long enough,

325
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,119
you'll see Jesus
Christ, Himself,

326
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,222
playing a guitar and cussing
like a cowhand on payday.

327
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,170
- Nevertheless, I saw...

328
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,006
As I was saying,
Charlie was a decent--

329
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:26,165
- Henry, what in the
hell are you doing?

330
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,933
- We're in a
dangerous predicament.

331
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,201
It will enthrall the
readers of my pa per.

332
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,006
- If you ever get
time to finish it!

333
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:36,678
- There's two of them.

334
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,375
One out front, and one behind.

335
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,221
- Listen up, you're
caught in a crossfire now!

336
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,291
So drop your guns and stand up!

337
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,156
- Any suggestions, Calhoun?

338
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,329
- Do what my
brother told you!

339
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,297
- Well, nothing comes to mind.

340
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,303
- Come on now!

341
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,577
I said drop it didn't I?

342
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,217
I didn't see you
drop your gun, son.

343
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,783
- He ain't got a gun.

344
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,258
- Is that right?

345
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,829
What's your name, boy?

346
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,099
- Henry Lester.

347
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,658
- Henry?

348
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,793
Come here.

349
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,271
Come here!

350
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,105
I want you to go around,
get everybody's weapon,

351
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,176
including the stage
driver's and his pal.

352
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,474
And you don't do
nothing to make me

353
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,242
want to shoot you
now, you hear me?

354
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,977
- Yes, sir.

355
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,210
- Maybe we should
introduce ourselves.

356
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,049
I'm Hank Norton.

357
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,246
This here's my half-brother Jeb.

358
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,287
- If you've heard of us,

359
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,193
you're gonna know
what we're capable of.

360
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,320
- Back-shooting
innocent people, mostly.

361
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,227
- What's your name, cowboy?

362
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,758
- Calhoun.

363
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,270
- Have we met someplace?

364
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,711
- No, I think I'd
remember the smell.

365
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,655
- This is nice.

366
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,283
And we're gonna
have to watch you.

367
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,924
Cause you're a
smart-mouthed asshole.

368
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,363
- Okay, everybody inside!

369
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,600
- Move it!

370
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,670
Henry, you hold on real
tight to those, now.

371
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,713
- Okay Jeb,
bring them in!

372
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,313
- Alright, move it up!

373
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,723
I said move it up!

374
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:07,196
Get over there.

375
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,505
What you looking at?

376
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:26,840
You are a sight for sore
eyes, ain't that the truth.

377
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,684
- You bastard.

378
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:32,747
You wanna point it at me?

379
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,354
- Can't no one
call me a bastard,

380
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,497
seeing as I never
knew my old man!

381
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,625
- Jeb don't even
let me call him a bastard.

382
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,896
Last time I did, he put a
pickaxe through my chest.

383
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,937
I still got the 10-inch
scar here, to prove it.

384
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,833
- Cause when I get riled,

385
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,407
there ain't no limit
to what I'm capable of.

386
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,276
When I want something,

387
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,415
I just takes it!

388
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,148
You got something else
to say to me, huh?

389
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:15,299
Well, lookie here.

390
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,165
We got ourselves a lawman!

391
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,668
- Shoot him!

392
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,932
- Please, don't shoot him!

393
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,404
- And the girl!

394
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,407
- I ain't shooting her.

395
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,670
I got plans for her.

396
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,544
- Norton, you kill me,
the law will hunt you down

397
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,376
and make sure you both hang.

398
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,971
- And if I pull this
trigger right here,

399
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,049
your sweet little wife,
she's gonna be a widow.

400
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,449
What you say about that?

401
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,520
- I'd say you wouldn't act
so tough if I had a gun.

402
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,251
- Is that right?

403
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,584
Well, take one of mine.

404
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,561
Come on, we'll have a
shoot-out right here.

405
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,359
Come on, take it!

406
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,454
Take it, I said!

407
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,259
- How about giving me the gun?

408
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,465
- What'd you say?

409
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,300
You...

410
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,234
I reckon you might be trouble.

411
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,580
' Me?

412
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,672
I'm no trouble to anyone.

413
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,175
- Jesus Christ, Jeb pull
the trigger, shoot somebody.

414
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,247
- I'm not sure whether
I'm gonna kill you now

415
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,952
or let you watch me have
some fun with your Missus.

416
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,391
Lawman, why don't you go hide
behind your wife's petticoats.

417
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,834
- Excuse me,
mister Norton, these guns

418
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,165
are getting very heavy.

419
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,207
- Listen Henry,why
don't you take those guns

420
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,471
and stick them in
a barrel outside.

421
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,478
Come straight back,
you understand?

422
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,344
Go on, git.

423
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,515
- Move it!

424
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,879
- Who's funeral is this anyway?

425
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,055
- Old timer who ran this
place for the stage line,

426
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,481
got his throat tom
out by something.

427
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,527
- What kind of something?

428
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,496
- We ain't exactly sure.

429
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,396
' A grizzly?

430
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,660
- No, ain't been no grizzlies

431
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,361
in these parts,
for 9 or 10 years.

432
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,494
- Well how about old Mose?

433
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,096
- There you go talking
a damn fool again.

434
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,174
- Well, he's supposed
to be 10 foot tall,

435
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,868
weigh 1,500 pounds,
and I heard he

436
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,910
killed those bulls
with one blow.

437
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,810
- Old Mose does his hunting
up in Freemont county.

438
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,577
It's two or 300 miles from here.

439
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,549
- Maybe he learnt
to ride a mule.

440
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,916
- What is your name?

441
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,624
- Mrs. Marie Cooper.

442
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,193
And yours must be Horses Ass,

443
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,591
cause you surely smell like one.

444
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,594
- You open your god
damn mouth again,

445
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,232
I'm gonna put a bullet in it.

446
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,960
Henry, come sit over here.

447
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,504
- If it weren't a bear
that killed that old-timer,

448
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,064
then what done it?

449
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,541
- Something strong enough
to tear out his liver.

450
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,276
- My wife needs water.

451
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,714
- She's
gonna have to wait.

452
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,116
- Look at her.

453
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,711
- Jeb, watch her.

454
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,290
- I got it.

455
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,826
- Maybe it was a wolverine.

456
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,590
I heard of one, once,
that bit right through

457
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,598
a trapper's arm and
then ran off with it.

458
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,657
- Whatever it was,

459
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,330
it's got a taste for human meat.

460
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,137
Probably watching us right now.

461
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,608
- No accounting for taste.

462
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,840
- Cowboy, go stand
next to the post over there.

463
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,673
Lawman, you join him, go ahead.

464
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,115
Mrs. Cooper, why don't you go
see if you can find some rope.

465
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,985
Tie them up to that post.

466
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,056
Tie them up tight, do it now.

467
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,648
- You see
something out there?

468
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,557
- There ain't nothing to see.

469
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,264
Jeb, why don't you head
out back into the kitchen,

470
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,134
see if the old man kept
some guns back there.

471
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,333
- I'm busy!
- Go on!

472
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,704
- I said I'm busy!

473
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,243
- Don't make me
tell you again, boy.

474
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,478
- God dammit.

475
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,344
- This good enough?

476
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,718
- Tie them up.

477
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,732
- Sorry about this.

478
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,494
- Better make them tight.

479
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,234
- Quit talking!

480
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,698
- No guns, and I've
locked the back door.

481
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,970
- Why don't you
head out to the kitchen,

482
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,214
see if you can rustle
up some vittles.

483
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:58,078
Me and my brother need
to eat before we leave.

484
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,851
Jeb.

485
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:08,791
Jeb, Jeb!

486
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,258
- What?
- Get over here.

487
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,733
Keep an eye on these two.

488
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,542
- What is it
you saw out there?

489
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,747
- Forget it.

490
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,988
You finished?

491
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,562
- Nearly.

492
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,597
- Where the hell you learn
to tie a knot like that?

493
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,223
- Any cowboy gets
fresh in my saloon,

494
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,961
I string him up.

495
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,434
Hung 27 just this year.

496
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,505
You should call in for a drink.

497
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:16,319
- You didn't
bring a rifle?

498
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,895
- I have
enough protection.

499
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,829
White ash, prepared
by my father.

500
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,761
- Navajo magic, huh?

501
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,433
- Listen, if a skin-walker
is shot in the heart,

502
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,362
with a silver bullet,
it might appear to die.

503
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,270
White ash sends it to
the land of the dead.

504
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,003
- If you say so.

505
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,771
But we obviously don't
stock silver bullets.

506
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,943
So that stuff ain't
gonna help much.

507
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,675
- We'll see.

508
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,811
Wade listen, on the way over
here, I had another vision.

509
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,981
" oh yeah?

510
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,284
They're coming in thick
and fast aren't they?

511
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:46,983
- Listen to me.

512
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,183
I saw you and me
under the blood moon.

513
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,785
And death was reaching
out to both of us.

514
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,229
- Well, the Norton's are
pretty handy with guns.

515
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,927
- You know damn well, I'm not
talking about the Nortons.

516
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,863
- Look, the sun's gonna go
down in a couple of hours.

517
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,640
- You afraid of the dark?

518
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,809
- Hell no.

519
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,678
- Nor me.

520
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:11,908
But it is a wise man who fears

521
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,079
what might be
hiding in the dark.

522
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,684
- Yeah.

523
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,195
- God dammit.

524
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,585
- Hey lady!

525
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:49,916
Give me another cup.

526
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,912
- If you want
more coffee, Mr. Norton,

527
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,581
you're gonna need more water.

528
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,353
- Henry!

529
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:58,828
- Yes, sir?

530
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,421
- See that silver
bucket in the corner?

531
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,499
- Yes sir.

532
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,302
- Go fill it up with water
from the bucket outside.

533
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,839
And Henry!

534
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,105
You come back through that door,

535
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,874
with anything in your hands,

536
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,313
'sept that bucket,
you're a dead man.

537
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,527
Hey, cowboy.

538
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,860
You ever been to Wichita?

539
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,128
- Not that I recall.

540
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,236
- Me and Jeb come across
a gunslinger in Wichita,

541
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,701
about six or seven years ago.

542
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,870
Can't say I remember
his name but,

543
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,711
you sure look like him.

544
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,977
- Now you come to
mention it, he do.

545
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,417
- I look like a lot of people.

546
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,961
- He could draw, shoot a
man, and holster his gun,

547
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,592
before you even had
time to take a breath.

548
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,300
I heard he was a preacher.

549
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,999
He left the church on
a account of his family

550
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,972
got murdered by bushwhackers.

551
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,204
And he was so angry with God,

552
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,773
that he offered up
his mortal soul,

553
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,215
to the devil his
self, to get revenge.

554
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,094
And old Satan, well he made him

555
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,028
the fastest gunslinger
in the west.

556
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,999
And he hunted down
them bushwhackers.

557
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,035
And he killed them, one by one.

558
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,204
- Just how fast
are you, Calhoun?

559
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,783
- What makes you
think I am fast?

560
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,408
- I don't know,
something though.

561
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,852
- Well, there's an
easy way to find out.

562
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,651
- Untie me, gimme a pistol,

563
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,130
and you'll have your answer.

564
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,064
Before you have time
to take a breath.

565
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:24,068
- Son of a bitch, Henry!

566
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,176
- Come here.
- Get your hands off me.

567
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,946
- Give me that.

568
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,197
- Whoa, there.

569
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,304
Two horses stopped
here, three hours ago.

570
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,038
They covered the tracks with

571
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,308
earth and leaves, to confuse us.

572
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,746
- The Nortons?

573
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,113
- Has to be.

574
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,754
- You alright?

575
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,052
- Yea h, I'm just a little dizzy.

576
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,288
- When's the last time you ate?

577
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,422
- I caught a rabbit
for breakfast,

578
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,696
killed it, skinned it, ate it.

579
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,099
- You missed out cooked it.

580
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,133
- Did I?

581
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,108
They took this trail.

582
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,073
- Okay, look if you're
sick, I understand.

583
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,343
YOU can turn around.

584
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:43,921
I can do this trail alone.

585
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,854
-You?

586
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,082
You couldn't find
your ass in the dark,

587
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,091
even if it was on fire.

588
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,093
- You think so, huh?

589
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,128
- Mm-hmm.

590
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,093
- I think I can surprise you.

591
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,426
Heh!

592
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,391
- Hey, wait up!

593
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,020
- How long you gonna be?

594
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,895
- A couple of minutes.

595
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,161
- What's she doing?

596
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,362
- She has a name.

597
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,063
Sarah's just made your coffee.

598
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,129
We'll be on through in a
minute, with your food too.

599
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,205
- I don't know
shit about cooking,

600
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,408
but I do know it takes
sharp knives for cutting.

601
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,417
<i>'</i> Sugar?

602
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,177
- Three.

603
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,180
Me and Jeb each.

604
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,660
And make sure you--

605
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,506
- Hank, what
in the hell was that?

606
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,569
- I'm gonna look outside.

607
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,772
- You can't go out there.

608
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,145
- The hell's
wrong with you?

609
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,196
- Hey Calhoun, you really reckon

610
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,732
that's what killed
the old timer?

611
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,527
- Yeah.

612
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,567
- What'd you just say?

613
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,428
- It's a skin-walker, Hank.

614
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,803
- Skin-walker?

615
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,247
Ain't no such thing.

616
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,251
- Well, you could go out
there and prove us wrong.

617
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,877
- Hank, you
can't go out there.

618
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,057
- Shut up!

619
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,216
- Henry, you know
you really should

620
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,453
write about the skin-walkers
in your newspaper.

621
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,255
It would make your
readers' hair stand on end.

622
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,296
Even those bald Englishmen
you've got over there.

623
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,269
- Shut up, we've heard enough!

624
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,236
- Keep talking, lawman.

625
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,238
Maybe Jeb will realize
it's all horse shit.

626
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,276
- A couple of years back,

627
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,775
there was this skin-walker
living in these parts.

628
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,642
Went around eating
Indians and cowboys,

629
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,250
and cattle rustlers.

630
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,616
- Oh. yeah?

631
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,744
- Took seven Navajo
braves to kill it.

632
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,291
And in its gut, they
found the bodies

633
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,558
of five of the most
ornery outlaws,

634
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,995
that ever robbed a bank,

635
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,963
all chewed up, to hell.

636
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,798
- Is that right?

637
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:51,900
- Well, the fella who
told me swore it was.

638
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,946
- Maybe there is a
Indian running around,

639
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,487
who thinks he's a wolf,

640
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,351
but if he's out there,

641
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,318
I'm gonna blow him
to kingdom come.

642
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:16,297
- Only thing that'll
kill a skin-walker

643
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,698
is a silver bullet
through the heart.

644
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,326
- Calhoun, shut your face!

645
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,268
Or I'll put a bullet
through your head,

646
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,329
and it won't need
to be a silver one!

647
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,008
- Get it while it's hot.

648
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,605
If you're still alive to eat it.

649
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,381
- If I come back, and
I'm tall dark and hairy,

650
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,591
shoot, cause it ain't me.

651
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:31,395
- Hank?

652
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:32,299
- Let me in God dammit!

653
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,437
Open the door!

654
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,996
Come on!

655
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,306
What?

656
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,145
- We gotta
get out of here.

657
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,586
- What?

658
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,781
- The bodies out back, is gone.

659
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,121
Take a look at this.

660
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,454
- A bible, all chewed up.

661
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,464
Jesus Christ, Hank,
what are we gonna do?

662
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,660
- Stick to the plan,
and head south.

663
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,205
- Can I?

664
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:25,646
- So, you boys are thinking
of heading down to Mexico?

665
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,516
Lots of pretty senoritas there.

666
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,758
And they love gringos.

667
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,499
- That right?

668
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,001
- Mm-hmm.

669
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,695
- Well, I never had a
Mexican woman before.

670
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,530
" Ain't you?

671
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,665
- No, I had saloon
girls and farmer's daughters.

672
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,708
I even had a
preacher's wife once.

673
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,549
And they all look
the same to me,

674
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,309
when they're bare-ass naked
I can see their titties.

675
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,891
Although, some do look
prettier than others.

676
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,099
Just how much time we got, Hank?

677
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,041
- We got enough.

678
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:22,873
But I take the young one first.

679
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,571
- That ain't fair.

680
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,876
- I'm the eldest, it's my right!

681
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,314
- I ain't arguing,
this one's mine.

682
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,351
- Are you saying
that you prefer her,

683
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,852
to a real woman?

684
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,562
- What are you doing?

685
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,225
- Well, Hank, I'm just saying,

686
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,629
that what I got here, well,

687
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,740
it's just as juicy,
as a girl at 21.

688
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,427
Jeb?

689
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,391
I can't concentrate on this,
if you're still holding her.

690
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,129
Sit down.

691
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,098
- Is this how you like it, Jeb?

692
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,440
Nice and slow?

693
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:37,410
What about you, Hank?

694
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:38,955
- Sure.

695
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,119
But I'm still gonna beat the
ever-loving shit out of you.

696
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:46,186
- Why, Mr. Hank Norton,

697
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:47,957
you’re just a romantic
old fool ain't you?

698
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,563
- When I
get back to London,

699
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:53,830
my editor will not believe
the things I've seen.

700
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,269
- I hope that
includes me, darling.

701
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:58,997
- I think it does.

702
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:01,903
- Henry, go
outside and get them

703
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,276
guns brought in here.

704
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,145
- Are you sure
that's wise, Mr. Norton?

705
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:19,225
- I reckon you might
have done this before.

706
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,492
- Oh, do you now?

707
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,363
Well, come here, I'll
tell you a little secret.

708
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:25,861
When you run a saloon,

709
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,673
not too close, well sometimes,

710
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,437
you just gots to
entertain the boys.

711
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,710
And other times,

712
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,578
Mr. Norton, you
gotta surprise them.

713
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,723
'Jeb.hey!

714
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,708
- That was some shot.

715
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,369
- I only had one bullet.

716
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,376
- Well, sometimes
that's all it takes.

717
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,715
- Where'd you say
you were from again?

718
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,586
- Well, I'd tell you but,

719
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,791
you'd never have heard of it.

720
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,163
- Why don't you try me?

721
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,330
- We need to move.

722
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,744
- It's Henry!

723
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,802
- Henry, I'm coming.

724
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,886
Henry!

725
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,324
Jesus...

726
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,796
Henry?

727
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,447
- Get back inside.

728
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:35,425
Watch it don't
come over the roof.

729
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,760
- The skin-walker is real.

730
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,428
- Uh-huh.

731
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,565
Darndest thing I ever saw.

732
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,514
- Ever used a gun?

733
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,208
- No, no.

734
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:32,012
- I want you to go to
the kitchen and lock the door.

735
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,991
If that thing breaks in,

736
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:36,356
I want you to aim
this at its head,

737
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,916
and pull the
trigger, understand?

738
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,100
Go.

739
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,541
- Jake, it's still up there!

740
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,779
- Yeah, I can hear it!

741
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,744
- Jake!

742
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:36,779
- Calhoun, it's out back!

743
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,812
Jake!

744
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,155
- Jake.

745
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,098
- Sarah!

746
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,032
- Get off!

747
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,795
- Sarah okay?

748
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,093
- Cut some.

749
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,395
Norton saved her life.

750
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,564
- I reckon he was mostly
thinking about his own.

751
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,107
He tied up?

752
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,565
- Yeah, Sarah's watching him.

753
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,242
You found something?

754
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,680
- Yeah, a blood trail.

755
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,115
- Well, when an animal's hurt,

756
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,815
it goes to where
it feels safest.

757
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,617
- It'll be back.

758
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,129
- We better be moving
on soon, to Pine Flats,

759
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,935
that's where you think the
Norton brothers are headed.

760
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,571
You been real quiet
for the last hour.

761
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,411
- You talked
enough for the both of us.

762
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,011
- After your
fight with Ahiga.

763
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:00,784
He called you an antahini.

764
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,882
That means witch.

765
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,424
- In my tribe,
a witch cures sickness,

766
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,463
with plants and
herbs, nothing more.

767
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,330
- Nice try, Black Deer.

768
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,298
A skin-walker don't
necessarily have to be a witch,

769
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,668
but a Navajo witch is
always a skin-walker.

770
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,642
- Some of us
are only part skin-walker.

771
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,372
But if the beast
within is too strong,

772
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,178
l turn into something
half-human, half skin-walker,

773
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,549
hated and hunted by both.

774
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,452
- That white ash you got,

775
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,184
it's to protect yourself.

776
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:38,323
Marshal Wade Norman,

777
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,465
why did you have to
be so damn clever?

778
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,674
I preferred you when
you were as a dumb-ass.

779
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,180
- So it's true.

780
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:05,578
Now I know why
you drink so much.

781
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:15,194
The gunsmith had three
silver bullets in stock.

782
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,204
- Black Deer!

783
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:37,110
- Wade...

784
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:58,238
- You know your
way around a team.

785
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,833
You ever been a
stagecoach driver?

786
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,707
- I rode shotgun a
while, over in Kansas.

787
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,475
- Never been to Kansas, myself.

788
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,949
I was born in Chicago.

789
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,816
My parents moved me out
west, when I was nine.

790
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,312
Met my cousin Wade in Denver.

791
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,022
And he took me south,
down to Lassiter,

792
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,254
where he lives now.

793
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,796
He taught me all
about law enforcement.

794
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,996
I was made deputy when
I was 17 years old.

795
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,496
You always stood the
right side of the law?

796
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:30,872
Calhoun?

797
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:34,508
-Huh?

798
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,238
- I said have you always stayed
the right side of the law?

799
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,842
- I've done some bad
things to survive.

800
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,715
Got blood on my hands but,

801
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,785
none of it innocent.

802
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,557
Stay vigilant, Jake.

803
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:07,170
- My arm.

804
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:12,214
Give me a whiskey.

805
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,647
My arm's on fire.

806
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,116
- Uh-uh.

807
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,277
- I think it might be broke.

808
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,348
You ain't gonna give
me a cup of that?

809
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,586
- Strong coffee can go
straight to the head.

810
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,197
- And after I saved your life.

811
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:41,002
- Before that thing turned up,

812
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,242
you and your brother
would have had me,

813
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,342
on this stinking floor,

814
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,351
and laughed while you did it.

815
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,051
You probably would have
murdered us all, too.

816
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:58,183
So don't you dare talk
about saving my life.

817
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,390
You murdering outlaw, scum.

818
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:11,774
- Well now, lady,

819
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,832
I reckon I seen right through
you, to the bare bone.

820
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,943
I may be a piece of
murdering, outlaw-scum,

821
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,358
but I been places.

822
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,621
- Nowhere that sold
soap obviously.

823
01:00:34,864 --> 01:00:36,628
- I've had me a bath
or two, in my day.

824
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,564
When I was visiting whore-houses
in Wichita and Dodge.

825
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,736
- I bet the girls there
loved your company.

826
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:49,173
- Innocent young girls,

827
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,378
don't know how to
handle a knife,

828
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,475
cut a man's throat.

829
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,648
On account of they'd
be shaking with nerves.

830
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,931
But a common whore,

831
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,160
she knows how to use a blade,

832
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,863
for her own protection.

833
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,467
- I'd remind you,
that I'm the wife

834
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,834
of Lassiter's deputy marshal.

835
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,139
Do you think he would
marry a common whore?

836
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,510
- Sure, if you fed him
some bullshit story

837
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:32,652
about how you come from
a fine family back east,

838
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,555
and pretended to be a
sweet, young virgin--

839
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,867
I knew I was right.

840
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,335
- If you say anything,
to my husband,

841
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,834
you can bet your unwashed ass,

842
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,712
that this innocent little lady,

843
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,380
will happily cut off
your fucking balls,

844
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,147
and fry them in bacon fat.

845
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,850
- I reckon you just might.

846
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,495
- He annoying you?

847
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,335
- No, he isn't gonna
cause us anymore trouble.

848
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,565
Are you?

849
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:33,509
- Almost
ready to roll.

850
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,244
Jake's keeping a look-out.

851
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:37,550
- I'll take
this out to Jake.

852
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,280
- Hey preacher.

853
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,183
You wanna know where
me and my brother Jeb

854
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,186
hid the bank money we
took, this afternoon?

855
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,460
Set me free,

856
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,762
and I'll divvy it
with you, 50-50.

857
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,235
- Norton, as
far as I'm concerned,

858
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,636
your blood-money should stay
buried until hell freezes over.

859
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,776
- Glad you
think that way Calhoun.

860
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,205
Let's get aboard.

861
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,011
- Will you stop that spitting?

862
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,548
- The horses!

863
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:17,518
- I swear I left the brake on.

864
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,591
- You did, I checked.

865
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,092
The horses are gone too.

866
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,526
- He's one devious
bastard ain't he?

867
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,235
- You show me a nine-foot
flesh-eating critter who ain't.

868
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:39,642
- What happened?

869
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,250
- Someone
spooked the horses,

870
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,141
rattlesnake maybe.

871
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,084
- No, it was my fault,
the brake wasn't left on.

872
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,585
- And mine.

873
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,182
- You don't
have to lie, Calhoun.

874
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,589
It's clear the
skin-walker did this.

875
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,628
- Norton...

876
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,255
- We're gonna need more light.

877
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:04,203
- Well, there's more lamps
in the livery stable.

878
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,976
- Let's go.

879
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,171
- I've got this.

880
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,109
- Jake.

881
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,815
- Lock the
door behind us.

882
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:26,687
- You're gonna die!

883
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:14,967
- So what
are our chances?

884
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,738
- Depends if we
can hold out till

885
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,043
the stage-line comes
through tomorrow.

886
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,278
- We better pray
it ain't delayed.

887
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,380
- Interesting choice of words.

888
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,726
You a religious man?

889
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,494
- I've been known
to go to church.

890
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:45,132
- Anything
happens to me,

891
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,697
I'd appreciate you saying
a prayer over my grave.

892
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:48,776
- Any one in particular?

893
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,240
- Shortest one you can find.

894
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,547
I get bored real easy.

895
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,476
Remember,just a prayer.

896
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:32,020
No hymns.

897
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,957
- Reckon I can get a
handle on most men but,

898
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,786
truth be told, Calhoun,

899
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,026
you're a solid
gold puzzle to me.

900
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:48,926
- Better watch out for that
mule that's been hanging around.

901
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,838
I reckon he's got
one hell of a kick.

902
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:58,441
Ready?

903
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:49,860
- Hey Calhoun,I
found your mule.

904
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,000
- Jake...

905
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,025
- Hey, come here, I've
got something for you.

906
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,785
- I better go get
what we came for.

907
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,652
- Then I'd better come with you.

908
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,963
- You're a very brave lady.

909
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,760
- No, I'm a very frightened one.

910
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,064
- I'll never forgive myself
for bringing you all the way--

911
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,509
I promise I'm gonna
get us out of here.

912
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,947
- You better, I wanna see
this one-horse town of yours.

913
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:30,065
- Come on, love birds.

914
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,227
We better get back before
Norton spits himself to death.

915
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:49,017
- Well, sounds like you folks

916
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:51,519
were having a hell
of a party out there.

917
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,022
just surprised
to see you all in one piece.

918
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,118
- I'm touched by your concern.

919
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,224
- Better get some
alcohol on that.

920
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,995
Wound ain't gonna
clean itself, Jake.

921
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:15,301
- I'll
keep first watch.

922
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,778
- Gonna be along night.

923
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:45,004
- Any sign?

924
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,599
- Nope.

925
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,673
Mind if I ask you a question?

926
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,773
- Not if it's why the
hell did you bring

927
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:57,417
such a pretty girl to
this god-forsaken place.

928
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:00,122
- Something like that.

929
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,751
- When Sarah agreed to marry me,

930
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,084
I did consider
staying on in Durango.

931
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,426
Maybe take a deputy's
job down there.

932
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,296
She wanted to get
away from the place,

933
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,264
make a fresh start.

934
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,543
So here we are.

935
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,080
- Yeah, wherever here is.

936
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:46,693
- It's coming in for the kill.

937
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:00,715
I want you two back here.

938
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,018
- No, I
wanna fight with you.

939
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,088
- More guns, the better.

940
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:12,058
- Oh, second time
that's happened.

941
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,288
I meant to get it fixed.

942
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,822
- Is this genuine?

943
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,128
- Some of them are.

944
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:20,965
Hey, you don't think...

945
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,538
- Well, we'll see.

946
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,452
- You have to hit it
directly in the heart.

947
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,548
- My dad said
these would look after me.

948
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:45,790
- If that works,
I'll eat my head.

949
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,791
- Well, if it doesn't work,

950
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,764
the skin-walker
will eat it for you.

951
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,701
- How are we gonna get
a clean shot at it?

952
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,310
- Norton's gonna be our bait.

953
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,937
- Norton's gonna be our bait.

954
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,217
- You sick son of a bitch.

955
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,238
- Shit.

956
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,381
- Thank you.

957
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:00,716
- Marshal Norman.

958
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:01,755
- Wade, I'm Jake's wife.

959
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:03,484
Jake...

960
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,495
- He breathing?

961
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,864
- Yeah, he's
breathing, he's alive.

962
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:20,205
Is he okay?

963
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:21,401
- Nope, this man's dead.

964
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,404
- You know what that thing is?

965
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,914
- Yeah, I've
seen one before.

966
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,848
Shot saved a silver bullet.

967
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,383
- You alright?

968
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:32,911
Wade's here, he saved me.

969
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,352
- Wade, good to see you.

970
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:38,085
There're silver rings in the
shotgun there, understand?

971
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:50,365
- Skin-walker's gone.

972
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,964
- What about Marie?

973
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:53,739
Calhoun?

974
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,202
- That his name?

975
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:06,384
- Don't call for an
undertaker just yet.

976
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,617
- We thought
you were dead.

977
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,355
- No, I've got other plans.

978
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:14,018
Where is it?

979
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,906
Hand me that shotgun.

980
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,909
Marie?

981
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:56,636
- Jesus, Wade what
happened to your neck?

982
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,433
- We're gonna all
be having them tonight.

983
01:17:58,507 --> 01:17:59,975
Ain't over yet.

984
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,696
- Return to hell.

985
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,511
Bastard's dead but
it won't lie down.

986
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:38,107
- Try this.

987
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:46,351
- White ash?

988
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:47,547
- You seen it before?

989
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:15,511
- Is it at peace?

990
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,676
- It don't deserve to be.

991
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,013
- Don't you
believe in redemption?

992
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,522
That our past sins
can be forgiven?

993
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,593
- Sure he does.

994
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,326
And so do I.

995
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,566
- Name is Calhoun.

996
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,092
- Marshal Wade
Norman, Jake's cousin.

997
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,234
Found the stage a
couple miles back.

998
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,409
- That's Hank Norton.

999
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,175
What's left of him.

1000
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,351
Brother Jeb's out back.

1001
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,576
Fact is, there's
more dead folks,

1002
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:54,583
around here, than live ones.

1003
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,555
- Well, there's a

1004
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,559
on the Norton brothers' heads,

1005
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,220
alive or dead.

1006
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:01,888
- There's a lady in
there, didn't make it.

1007
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,128
She's the one who
took down Jeb Norton.

1008
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,603
I want her buried right.

1009
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,265
That'll be my reward.

1010
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:13,037
- I'll see to it.

1011
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,174
- Hey wade, how about you take

1012
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,941
me and my new wife
home to Lassiter?

1013
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,638
- Of course, cousin.

1014
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:20,644
- Unless you've
changed your mind.

1015
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,579
- If you two ever
have young'uns,

1016
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,817
I'd sure like to be
there when you tell them

1017
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,517
how you spent your honeymoon.

1018
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,253
- You got any plans, Calhoun?

1019
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,656
- I'll be moving on.

1020
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:37,665
- That's a real shame.

1021
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,597
Lassiter needs another deputy.

1022
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,433
Pays 20 dollars a month, right?

1023
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,037
- I reckon
he'd be worth 30.

1024
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,110
- Is that an offer
you might consider?

1025
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,245
- I got me a job lined
up, down in Santa Clara.

1026
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,947
- What could you possibly
find to do in Santa Clara.

1027
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:04,622
- The sheriff's
asked me to deal with

1028
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:05,626
some varmints
causing big trouble.

1029
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,492
- What kind of varmints?

1030
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,661
- Oh, red-eyed demons,
six inch claws,

1031
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,663
bat's wings, and a bad attitude.

1032
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:20,241
- Well, guess you'll need
your prayer book back.

1033
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,078
- Keep it.

1034
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:36,891
- Hey, Calhoun, where'd
you say you're from again?

1035
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:40,118
- Well, I'd tell you but,

1036
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,827
you'd never have heard of it.
