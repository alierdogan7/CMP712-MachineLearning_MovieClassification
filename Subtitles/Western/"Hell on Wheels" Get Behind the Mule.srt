to save a child.

184
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:17,758
We were outgunned,
plain and simple.

185
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,293
We did everything we could
for Mr. Bohannon,

186
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:23,046
even at great danger
to ourselves,

187
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,081
especially Mr. Durant.

188
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,803
Now let me show you
to your room, General.

189
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:31,521
And what can I get you
to drink?

190
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,590
Bourbon, madame.
A double.

191
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,400
He has until 6:00.

192
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:44,434
There's still time.

193
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:54,327
You got any last words,
you be a man.

194
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,046
Say 'em to me, not my daughter.

195
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,664
You done enough to Naomi.

196
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:00,917
Been doing some hard thinking.

197
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,419
I wanna make things right.

198
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,888
You were my guest.

199
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:07,174
I gave you shelter.

200
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:09,142
And you repaid the kindness

201
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,261
by stripping
my most beloved daughter

202
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:13,647
of her chastity and virtue.

203
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:16,016
Now she'll live this life
in shame

204
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,702
and spend eternity
in outer darkness.

205
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,238
No God-fearing man
will have her.

206
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:24,207
I'll have her.
I'll marry her.

207
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,609
If she'll have me.

208
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:28,445
No. I will not
let her be a party

209
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,281
to your coward's attempt
to escape justice.

210
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:33,667
I ain't a coward, sir.

211
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:37,454
I'm that child's father.

212
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:39,339
I'll stay here at Fort Smith

213
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:40,340
till the child's born
and our first crops

214
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:41,875
are in the ground.

215
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,094
Now, you have my word:

216
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:46,763
I'll give them a good
and honest life.

217
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,466
I ain't never broke my word
to you for ill or naught,

218
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,551
and you know that.

219
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:55,439
She was my joy.

220
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:57,357
She could have married a bishop

221
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:59,726
or an apostle.

222
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:02,729
Brigham young himself
would have been proud

223
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,732
to call her his wife.

224
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,735
But now...

225
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:13,573
her only suitor is a gentile.

226
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:15,575
And a killer.

227
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,503
I will seek counsel.

228
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,974
But the bishop's word is final.

229
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,865
Shit.

230
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:01,904
[Cocks gun]

231
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:09,545
Hyah!

232
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,715
[Men shouting]

233
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:21,524

[Arrow whizzes, gunshot]

237
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:40,493
Come on!

238
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,162
Come at me,
or get the hell out my way.

239
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:09,304
I've been praying
for your soul.

240
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:13,025
You can drop the pious bullshit

241
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:15,277
and the phony accent.

242
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:17,279
We both know you're that Swedish
son of a bitch,

243
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,497
Thor Gundersen.

244
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:21,867
Thor Gundersen was Norwegian.

245
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,253
And he was a troubled soul...

246
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,672
who fell from a bridge
in Nebraska.

247
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:27,923
Not far enough.

248
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,293
And I am Bishop Joseph Dutson,

249
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:35,047
reborn in the holy
baptismal waters

250
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:39,768
and blessed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

251
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:42,438
You're a bloodthirsty murderer.

252
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:46,725
You are not without sin...
Mr. Bohannon.

253
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,814
It does not matter
what you believe.

254
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:54,567
I am bishop here,

255
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:57,202
and I have had a revelation...

256
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,521
on the subject of your fate.

257
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:08,047
I ain't gonna hang, am I?

258
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:09,832
What makes you believe that?

259
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:12,051
Those gallows are strong.

260
00:18:12,085 --> 00:18:16,722
The rope secure.

261
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:19,341
I'm marrying Hatch's daughter.

262
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,594
I'm the arbiter
of the law here,

263
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,228
not Brother Hatch.

264
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,514
No, I've seen a dozen men
stake their lives

265
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:27,650
on his word, not yours.

266
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:29,435
Besides...

267
00:18:29,486 --> 00:18:31,070
got the feeling you ain't
real popular around here.

268
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:32,771
Now, why would you say that?

269
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:34,657
You always ain't popular
wherever you turn up.

270
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:37,443
My credibility here
is more secure

271
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:39,828
than yours has ever been.

272
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:40,863
Maybe.

273
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,281
But I got the feeling

274
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,667
you done something real bad
to end up here.

275
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:47,252
Truth can't be far behind.

276
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,622
That ain't the real reason
you ain't gonna hang me.

277
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:51,173
Hmm.

278
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:55,044
Real reason is...

279
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:58,514
you can only kill me once.

280
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:01,717
That ain't gonna be
good enough for you, is it?

281
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,519
You'd rather see me
suffer and die,

282
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:06,472
little by little, each day.

283
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:10,025
Yes.

284
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,479
But heavenly father

285
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,649
wishes to see...you live.

[Laughing]

288
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,578
Mr. Cullen Bohannon
is in absentia.

289
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:34,049
And, as the largest
single shareholder

290
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,635
of Credit Mobilier stock,

291
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:42,474
I propose that all further
contracts and construction

292
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:47,846
be assigned to me,
Thomas C. Durant.

293
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:49,515
Do I have a second?

294
00:19:55,939 --> 00:20:00,109
Very well.

295
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:02,661
Then this will be the terminus

296
00:20:02,696 --> 00:20:04,697
of the Union Pacific Railroad!

297
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:08,250
This enterprise shall end here!

298
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,952

00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:32,441
In the powers vested in me

305
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:33,942
as chairman of Credit Mobilier,

306
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:36,612

She's yours.

00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:19,321
Do you want to be mine?

314
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:22,908
Yes.

315
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:25,227
It's God's will.

316
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,167
Well...

317
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:34,336
all right, then.

It is a tradition

that the meat's carved
at a side table

the lady's table linen.

for your thoughtfulness.
