The story that I want to tell you

cannot be found in a book.

18
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:51,083
They say the history of the West
was written

19
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,682
from the saddle of a horse

20
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,694

from the heart of one...

00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,566
I was born here

24
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:04,365
in this place that would come
to be called the Old West

25
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:07,703
but to my kind,
the land was ageless.

26
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:10,038
It had no beginning
and no end...

27
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,876
no boundary
between earth and sky.

28
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,711

is the spirit of the West.

or lost in the end

35
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,393

I want to tell you is true.

I remember the sun and the sky

38
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,406
and the wind calling my name

39
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:46,071

that would say this horse
could never be broken.

598
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:09,198
Discipline, time and patience...
