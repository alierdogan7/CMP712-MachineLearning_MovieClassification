1
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,351
(man #1) Building a railroad that
long is somebody's crazy dream.

2
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,155
(man #2) It's a
wonderful age we live in.

3
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,958
[laughing] A railroad
from Omaha to California?

4
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,895
One might as well think of flying.

5
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,524
President Lincoln is for it.

6
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,297
(Smith) This is the
most monumental folly...

7
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,032
ever conceived in the mind of man.

8
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,834
In all this broad land of ours...

9
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,478
who wants this railroad...

10
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,812
that will start at the
outer edge of civilization...

11
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,908
and wander expensively
through the wilderness?

12
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,912
Who, I ask you, except a small group...

13
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,789
of money-grabbing financiers,
self-seeking politicians...

14
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,993
and fanatical engineers?

15
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,528
[senators chattering]

16
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,360
[gavel tapping] Mr.
President. Mr. President.

17
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,299
(President) Does the Senator yield
to the gentleman from California?

18
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,337
I am not done, Mr. President.

19
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,605
I would like to read...

20
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,767
from a speech by the late
Daniel Webster on this subject.

21
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,575
Delivered from this very floor.

22
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,943
"What do we want with this
vast, worthless area...

23
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,346
"this region of savages
and wild beasts...

24
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,520
"of deserts and endless mountain ranges?

25
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,353
"What can we ever hope
to do with 3000 miles...

26
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,727
"of cheerless rockbound coast...

27
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,425
"and not a harbor on it?"

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,489
[senators chattering]

29
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,557
Not a harbor on it?

30
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,034
[gavel pounding]
(President) Order! Order!

31
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,469
[snickering] Why, there's room
in the San Francisco Bay...

32
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,200
to float all the navies of the world.

33
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,366
[senators laughing]

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,002
His word against Webster's.

35
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,441
[all cheering]
Mr. President. Mr. President.

36
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,008
(President) Mr. Sargent.

37
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,610
Gentlemen. The learned Senator asks...

38
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,479
Who wants this railroad?

39
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,079
Well, I'll tell you.

40
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,724
This nation, crippled by
four years of war, wants it.

41
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,921
[senators chattering]

42
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,486
A great artery...

43
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,331
through which may flow the
gold and silver of the West...

44
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,593
into the empty treasuries of the East.

45
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,268
(Sargent) Grain and cattle
into a war-torn South.

46
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,275
And thousands of men
released from both armies...

47
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,409
want it for the work and
the wages it will bring.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,511
And the merchants of the whole world...

49
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,913
who need a shorter route
to the Orient, they want it.

50
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,454
[senators exclaiming]

51
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,047
[gavel pounding]

52
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,514
Gentlemen...

53
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,427
I move you the adoption
of this railroad bill...

54
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:29,231
that shall bind us
together, East and West...

55
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,333
forever as one people.

56
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,463
[senators cheering]

57
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,631
[gavel pounding]

58
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,376
(Lincoln) Mr. Ames...

59
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,909
I want to take a ride
on this railroad...

60
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,915
the first thing after I
retire from the presidency.

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,285
(Ames) Mr. Lincoln had the
vision to conceive this railroad.

62
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,092
You gentlemen must have the
vision to help us finance it.

63
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,396
(Barrows) Frankly, Mr. Ames,
the only vision I can see...

64
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,297
is a lot of loose dollars
rolling away over those prairies.

65
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,425
Good day, gentlemen.

66
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,094
(Ames) But there's more than profit...

67
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,070
in the lap of this undertaking.

68
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,835
This railroad is the
future of the United States.

69
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,843
Along its rails, new cities will rise.

70
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,003
Is there not some danger
that the Central Pacific...

71
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,949
which is building east across
California, may reach Ogden first...

72
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,111
and keep you out of
the Salt Lake Valley?

73
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,348
President Lincoln wisely arranged...

74
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,790
that the Central Pacific will build
only to the California state line.

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,223
Here, where our tracks
will join with theirs.

76
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,021
General Dodge, uh...

77
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,097
as Chief Engineer of
the Union Pacific...

78
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,734
are you quite sure that a railroad
more than 1000 miles long...

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,570
can actually be built
through such a wilderness?

80
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,476
Yes. Yes. My brother Oliver and I...

81
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,014
are staking our fortune
on General Dodge's word...

82
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,413
that it can be done.

83
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,610
How much of your fortune, Mr. Ames?

84
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,988
We'll back the Union Pacific down
to the last shovel in our factory.

85
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,590
You're enthusiastic.

86
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,751
I promised Mr. Lincoln
to see it through.

87
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,660
Mr. Lincoln is dead. Well,
my promise to him is not dead.

88
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,823
Splendid, Mr. Ames, splendid.

89
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:09,493
I'm beginning to see a golden
harvest in these iron rails.

90
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,599
Then you are with us?

91
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,203
My hand on it.

92
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,599
(Ames) Thank you.

93
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,073
Thank you, Mr. Barrows.

94
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,441
On the contrary, I am indebted to
you for showing me the fortune...

95
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,448
there is to be made out of Union
Pacific. Good day, gentlemen.

96
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,538
(all) Good day, sir.

97
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,709
(Barrows) Good luck, General Dodge.

98
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,810
Good luck. (Dodge) Goodbye, all.

99
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,821
Goodbye, sir.

100
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,287
Who is Barrows?

101
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,882
The biggest moneybag in Chicago.

102
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,723
He makes them and breaks them out there.

103
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,160
I never thought he'd join you.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,222
What do you think would happen
if the Central Pacific...

105
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,530
should build all the way to
Ogden in the Salt Lake Valley?

106
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,731
It would bust the Union
Pacific higher than a kite.

107
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,535
Much higher.

108
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,569
But he said that Lincoln had
arranged for the Central to stop...

109
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,408
at the California
border. Lincoln is dead...

110
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,877
and there are those in Washington who
do not wish the Union Pacific well.

111
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,212
Can't both lines have
terminals in Ogden? No, Whipple.

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,985
You miss the point.

113
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,522
The Union Pacific has
authority to build only...

114
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,495
to where it meets the Central. Well?

115
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,466
And if the Central should
pass through Ogden first...

116
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:20,299
and meet the Union in the wilds
of the Wasatch Mountains...

117
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,536
Yes. Exactly.

118
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,374
The Union would have
1000 miles of track...

119
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,915
and a gopher hole for
its Western terminal.

120
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,774
Splendid.

121
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,615
We'll sell Union stock
short and buy Central.

122
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,248
We'll make millions, Mr.
Barrows. A golden opportunity.

123
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,521
Pure gold. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

124
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:47,564
But suppose the Union
Pacific gets to Ogden first?

125
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,930
It won't, Whipple.

126
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,859
I can assure you.

127
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,365
It won't.

128
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,072
(Rose) # They call me
the rose of St. Louis #

129
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,613
# The rose of this river town #

130
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,380
##[Rose humming]

131
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,826
Gentleman to see you, boss.

132
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,587
Mr. Barrows.

133
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,198
Bring in a bottle of
that extra-dry champagne.

134
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,529
Yes sir, extra dry.

135
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:23,791
Take a seat.

136
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,168
Oh. Rose...

137
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,598
# They call me the Rose of St. Louis ##

138
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,903
Sit down.

139
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,874
We ain't had the pleasure of
seeing you here before, Mr...

140
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,846
[chuckles]

141
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,741
Interesting decorations.

142
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,986
Only one like it in St. Louis.

143
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,614
I suppose you brought the
idea with you from Panama.

144
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:45,880
Panama?

145
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,788
This biography of yourself, written by
the best detective agency in Chicago.

146
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,028
What's on your mind, mister?

147
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,928
How's that partner of
mine doing? Very good, sir.

148
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,239
Mr. Campeau...

149
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,709
in the past, your operations
have always been, shall we say...

150
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,143
of a minor nature.

151
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,105
Do you think you could manage the
biggest gambling outfit in America?

152
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,879
Do you think you could
handle 10,000 workmen...

153
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,318
with plenty of money...

154
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,151
out in the wilderness?

155
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,657
Supplying them with liquor...

156
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,259
and any excitement the devil can brew?

157
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,091
Do you think you could keep them drunk
and discontented, month after month?

158
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,700
Go on.

159
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,238
Excuse me, Mr. Allen.

160
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,175
Mr. Campeau would admire to
see you in the other room.

161
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,839
Excuse me, gentlemen. Al. Al Brett...

162
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,577
take over.

163
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,810
It's your deal.

164
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:52,685
It means keeping your tent with its many
diversions at the end of the track...

165
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,248
as it moves West...

166
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:58,821
and selling the tracklayers all the
trouble they'll buy. You'll be protected.

167
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,629
What's the split? None. You take it all.

168
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,234
Including orders from me.

169
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,005
What kind of orders?

170
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,373
They will all add up the same. Delay.

171
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,045
Anything... I might say everything...

172
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,173
to delay the building of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

173
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,711
Why not?

174
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,914
Longer it takes, the more money I make.

175
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,186
Mr. Barrows, this is
my partner, Dick Allen.

176
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,994
Late of the Union Army...

177
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,696
but never late with a gun.

178
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,430
He'll be very handy, I assure you.

179
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,692
I've been making a deal with
your partner. A big deal.

180
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,035
We're leaving St. Louis.

181
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,802
For where and for
what? West, Mr. Allen...

182
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,906
for excitement and profit.

183
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,042
[chuckling] All right. Deal me in.

184
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,669
Where's my drink?

185
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,742
Here. I don't use it.

186
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,106
No?

187
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,713
Never take another man's drink.

188
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,085
It's bad luck.

189
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,314
Well, gentlemen...

190
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,289
here's to...

191
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,919
[laughing]

192
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,361
whatever it is.

193
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,896
[all laugh]

194
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,790
'Tis that cottonwood you're feeding him.

195
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,259
He won't eat it.

196
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,296
It gives him a pain in his boiler.

197
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,632
[train whistle blowing]

198
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,166
Hey, Monahan.

199
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,200
Do you want I should spell you a
bit, Monahan. In case you fall asleep?

200
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,835
Mollie Monahan, will you come down
out of that before some Indian...

201
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,106
beats me to the pleasure of killing you.

202
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,545
I brought you supper.

203
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,717
Suppose you fell off, and
I had to stop the train.

204
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,185
If you were half the dutiful daughter...

205
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,687
that this engine is to me...

206
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,986
Hold your whist. Here's your bite.

207
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,795
Heavens above. What's
in it? Coupling pins?

208
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,491
Cartridges. I forgot to
put them in your valise.

209
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,564
Get back to the caboose, you brat.

210
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,205
Twenty hours to Cheyenne...

211
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,967
and I'm supposed to
live on powder and lead.

212
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,773
I think you've been eating dynamite.

213
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,209
(Mollie) Good night, Mr. Barley.

214
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,405
(Barley) Good night, Mollie.

215
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,473
[snoring]

216
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,777
[Fiesta muttering]

217
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,411
Down.

218
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,055
I want it up. No. Down.

219
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,884
I said up.

220
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,757
Now listen, lady...

221
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,296
I want some fresh air.

222
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,628
Sure, and you'll get it,
right through your skull.

223
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,827
The Indians relish shooting
at the lighted windows.

224
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,496
[Fiesta chuckling]

225
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,904
That woman, she's just
like my wife I had in Omaha.

226
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,309
You know my wife, she's so mean...

227
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,037
she barks like the dogs, but me, well...

228
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,742
you know what I do? You married her.

229
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,581
Oh, sure. You bet yourself.

230
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,219
<i>She can cook frijoles. Mmm.</i>

231
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,619
The best in the whole world.

232
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,858
(Fiesta) Mollie.

233
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,530
(Fiesta) But I look around and...

234
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,299
pretty soon I marry my wife in Santa Fe.

235
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,571
The best woodchopper in the country.

236
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,338
You bet you my life, the best.

237
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,871
But one day she gets
bite by a rattlesnake.

238
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,041
She did? Yeah.

239
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,085
Did the doctor get there in
time? No, she's already dead.

240
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,882
Your wife? My wife?

241
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:19,413
No, no, the snake. My wife...

242
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,756
My wife, the next day, she's
so angry, she bites her brother.

243
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,219
Sure...

244
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,333
and his whole family is poisoned.

245
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,327
[snorting]

246
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,104
(Fiesta) And, anyhow, I'm
already gone to Yuma...

247
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,767
and there I marry Carmelita.

248
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,779
(Mollie) Now what did you marry her for?

249
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,876
You think to cook for me?

250
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,316
No. To chop me firewood? No.

251
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,984
Well, what did she do?

252
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,420
She...

253
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,622
[both laughing]

254
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,059
Yes, sir. Carmelita sure is a honey.

255
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,761
Yeah.

256
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,265
Hey, what you know?

257
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,200
(Fiesta) Leach, what you do here anyhow?

258
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,296
Hunting for you.

259
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,801
General Dodge wants to
see us back in his car.

260
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,004
At the rate you're going, Leach,
General Dodge won't live that long.

261
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,276
New troubleshooter is getting
aboard, somewheres hereabout.

262
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,026
Thanks, Sergeant. Good luck.

263
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,599
General Dodge aboard, Conductor?

264
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,936
Yep. If you're Jeff Butler,
he's looking for you.

265
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,134
I'll report, soon as I wash
off some of the prairie.

266
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,110
Yeah. A fella gets
kind of sweaty riding.

267
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,782
Campeau's crowd's in this car, Mollie.

268
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,010
##[man humming]

269
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,609
Rattlesnakes.

270
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,278
No self-respecting rattlesnake
would ride with them.

271
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,584
[chuckling]

272
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,051
##[humming]

273
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,854
##[whistling]

274
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,490
(Dick) Mollie.

275
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,688
Mollie Monahan.

276
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,956
Dick.

277
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,929
Sure, Dick, they told me
you'd not be back this year.

278
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,939
Did you think you'd
get rid of me that easy?

279
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,599
[Dick laughing]

280
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,042
Something's dead.

281
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,740
[sniffing]

282
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,276
Easy.

283
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,246
We'll bury him when the time comes.

284
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,492
Every minute that passed
had your name on it.

285
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,654
Oh, that's easy to listen
to, but hard to believe.

286
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,789
Me father said... That
he doesn't like gamblers.

287
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,956
Neither do I.

288
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:44,434
Here you are practicing to fleece
the poor lambs at the End of Track.

289
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,596
Marry me, Mollie, and I'll reform.

290
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,439
You haven't changed a bit.

291
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,234
Except maybe for the worse.

292
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,007
You're in love with her
and her three sisters.

293
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,978
You've got cards in your blood.

294
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,938
And you in my heart.

295
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,349
Go along with your soft talk.
You'll die with your boots on...

296
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,544
and your four ladies won't
be walking behind you.

297
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,522
Would you walk behind me?

298
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,454
Would be safer than walking
beside you to the altar.

299
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,517
[chuckling]

300
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:15,362
All the pasteboard ladies in the world
aren't worth one of your little fingers...

301
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,924
with a ring on it.

302
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,403
I'd better be getting back
to the caboose. No. Not yet.

303
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,267
Turn your back to me.

304
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,337
Close your eyes. Both of them.

305
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,074
Turn your head away.

306
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,282
This is to keep your heart
warm for your wedding day.

307
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,621
Oh. 'Tis never for me.

308
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,293
Not if it doesn't fit. Oh, it'll fit.

309
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,626
It is the most beautiful thing ever was.

310
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,766
But far too grand for a
poor engineer's daughter.

311
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,575
Not that Monahan's a poor engineer.
He's the best there is, but...

312
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,218
I suppose a good engineer's
daughter can get...

313
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,222
just as cold as a poor
engineer's daughter.

314
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,088
And a gambler can love you
just as much as a saint.

315
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,093
[train whistle blowing]

316
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,261
We might as well face the facts.

317
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,200
Central Pacific has not stopped at
the California state line as agreed.

318
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,134
They're over the Sierras,
and they've surveyed...

319
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,638
right through to Salt Lake and Ogden.

320
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,139
What do you think? But
they've got an agreement!

321
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,675
The devil himself is against us!

322
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,439
(Dodge) And what
happens to the people...

323
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,207
who backed us with their savings?

324
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,646
Busted. And so are we.

325
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,544
We're going to reach Ogden first.

326
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,110
Well, the Central will be there in 10
months. Then we'll be there in nine.

327
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,418
Look at the map, General Dodge.

328
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,526
We've built only 516
miles in three years.

329
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,958
And we're still 500 miles from Ogden.

330
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,991
And we're still going
to get there first. What?

331
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,434
Over the Rockies and Wasatch Mountains
with Indians claiming your food supply?

332
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:00,861
[scoffing]

333
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,073
Only the Irish could do
it. And I doubt if they can.

334
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,078
Good news or bad? Good.

335
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,837
We had a council at Broken Bow.

336
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,041
Red Cloud says the Indians'll
lay off the railroad...

337
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,346
if the whites will lay off the Indians.

338
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,649
Captain Butler served with me in
the war. He's just signed on with us.

339
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,587
Meet the two gentlemen
you'll be working for.

340
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,852
General Casement, in charge
of tracklaying. How are you?

341
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,416
How do you do, sir? Mr. Reed.

342
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,126
You tell him what your job is, Sam.

343
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,688
I see that the tracklayers don't
catch up with the graders...

344
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,757
the graders don't catch
up with the tie cutters...

345
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,531
the tie cutters don't catch up with
the tunnel and bridge builders...

346
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,367
and the lunatic asylum
doesn't catch up with me.

347
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,100
[all laughing]

348
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,769
My job, sir?

349
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,506
To establish and maintain order
along the entire right-of-way.

350
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,637
Troubleshooter, huh?

351
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,808
Yeah, and there's plenty of it.

352
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,975
(Reed) What's the worst problem?

353
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,213
Sid Campeau.

354
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,382
His whiskey and cards and what goes
with them follow the End of Track...

355
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,893
like a flock of vultures.
They've cost us a life every day.

356
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,225
Men drugged, robbed, murdered.

357
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,565
Crews disrupted by hired agitators.

358
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,567
Leach Overmile and Fiesta
here have been assigned to you.

359
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,160
They can tell you how Campeau operates.

360
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,772
I don't believe I'll need bodyguards.

361
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,639
Oh, no? You'll need them, all right.

362
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,108
You think we no good, eh?

363
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,884
No. It's not that, I...

364
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,012
We've had a lot of experience, Captain.

365
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,057
We bodyguarded the last
two troubleshooters...

366
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,059
right up till the very
minute they was killed.

367
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,355
[chuckles]

368
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,227
We'll get along all right.

369
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,162
[train whistle blowing]

370
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,366
(Butler) There's just one
question I'd like to ask, General.

371
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,837
Yes? What's the limit?

372
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,998
None.

373
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,838
Because our town's on wheels,
we've no civil law out here.

374
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,844
You're the law. And it's up to you to
smash anything that threatens to delay us.

375
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,213
That's all the orders
there are. Yes, sir.

376
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,453
I declare, he seems like
a right nice young fella.

377
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,016
I hope he lives long enough
so as we can get acquainted.

378
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,098
[whistle blowing]

379
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,974
[horse whinnying]

380
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,398
[train whistle blowing]

381
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,230
Hey, what's moving? You are.

382
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,671
Oh, am I, now? Yep.

383
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:57,138
Lady, you're on a brake wheel,
and one whistle means turn it.

384
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,807
Are you running this
train all by yourself?

385
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,446
No, but passengers aren't allowed on
the platform while the train's moving.

386
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,114
Passengers. Me?

387
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,824
[exclaiming]

388
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,225
You poor tenderfoot.

389
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,555
[door slamming]

390
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,622
[creaking]

391
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,461
The new troubleshooter's
looking for you, Mr. Campeau.

392
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,527
For what?

393
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,039
I don't know. Heading this way, though.

394
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,775
Keep an eye on him.

395
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,869
Al.

396
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,642
Al Brett, Cordray.

397
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,344
Rose, you and Mame better get
to the other end of the car.

398
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,478
A lady can't get no rest.

399
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,853
A lady don't need none.

400
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,753
Sit down and keep your eyes open.

401
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,018
(Campeau) Dick.

402
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,523
Sit down, Mollie, and keep low.

403
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,829
Why? What's going on?

404
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,160
Campeau's expecting company.

405
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,406
[train whistle blowing]

406
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,020
That's him.

407
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,790
Wait here.

408
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,295
Lonesome, handsome?

409
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,869
[woman giggling]

410
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,546
Jeff Butler. Dick.

411
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,815
You old dogcatcher.
You old chicken thief.

412
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,389
[both laughing]

413
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,915
(Dick) Remember the last time
I saw you in Philadelphia...

414
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,585
Baltimore... Oh, now wait.

415
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,795
We started celebrating our discharge
from the Army in New York...

416
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,456
and we came up for air in Philadelphia.

417
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,865
I put you to bed in Baltimore,
and I woke up in Washington.

418
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,562
Old army pals, huh?

419
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,105
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be alive.

420
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,697
Jeff, this is Sid Campeau.

421
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,969
(Butler) I've heard of Mr. Campeau.

422
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,511
This is Mr. Brett and Mr.
Cordray. Captain Butler.

423
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,568
Howdy. Hello.

424
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:09,636
Howdy.

425
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,744
[laughing] You old sharpshooter.
What are you doing here?

426
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,149
I'm working for the railroad.

427
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,312
Doing what? I'm assistant
superintendent of the...

428
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,050
Just a fancy name for troubleshooter?

429
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,747
Maybe.

430
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,128
It looks like we'd see
quite a lot of each other...

431
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,294
for a while.

432
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,759
I was figuring on having
a little talk with you.

433
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,395
Maybe you'd better have a little
talk with your friend here first.

434
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,401
Tell your playmates they
can sit easy for a while.

435
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,568
[laughing] Same old Jeff.

436
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,847
This is my seat, and this is
Miss Mollie Monahan. Jeff Butler.

437
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,416
Sit down, Jeff.

438
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,647
Jeff and I fought, bled and died
together, all during the war.

439
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,122
It wasn't you two that
won the war, was it?

440
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,783
[chuckling] Practically.

441
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,889
How much of a friend of
yours is Campeau? Sid?

442
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,191
He's my partner.

443
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,994
You'd better get yourself
another partner, Dick.

444
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,056
[chuckles]

445
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,964
I've already got my eye on one.

446
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:06,993
Oh.

447
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,564
Is it another slap you're
asking for, Mr. Butler?

448
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,200
Darling, will you kindly
hold your temper...

449
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,212
your tongue, and your two
little fists. They ain't little.

450
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,077
(Dick) You can't fight Mollie and live.

451
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,172
[laughs]

452
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,047
She's the postmistress at End of Track.

453
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,743
The eyes and tongue of 1000 men
who never learned to read or write.

454
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,790
She belongs to the railroad.

455
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,826
Although you'd think the
railroad belonged to her.

456
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,754
What about Campeau?

457
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,324
What about him?

458
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,958
Part of my job is to clear him
and his outfit off the line.

459
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,900
No, you can't do it, Jeff.

460
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,865
Don't try.

461
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,597
We've been through a lot
of storms together, Dick.

462
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:47,270
We've slept under the same
blanket, eaten off the same plate.

463
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,142
Join up with me again.

464
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,307
I'm standing pat and liking it.

465
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,952
Well, I'm afraid we're in
different armies this time.

466
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,648
You think there'll be a
rope around my neck someday?

467
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,985
Maybe.

468
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,518
[chuckles]

469
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:07,463
Sure now, that's a crazy way for
two friends to be saying hello.

470
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,856
[all laughing]

471
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,733
(woman) Hey, what's that? Hey, look.

472
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,802
The Injun boy, he race the iron horse.

473
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,501
[all laughing]

474
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,807
Monahan will bust his boiler
if the Injun keeps up with him.

475
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,675
[Fiesta laughing]

476
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,311
(man #1) Come on, Indian boy.

477
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,782
(man #2) Open up, Monahan.

478
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:28,474
(Bessie) Say, he's cute.

479
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:29,542
(woman #1) Now, Bessie.

480
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,215
$5, I get him on my first shot.

481
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,279
You're on.

482
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,347
(man #3) He's going to beat us.

483
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,450
(man #4) Oh, no, he won't.

484
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,516
[woman laughing]

485
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:39,795
[laughing]

486
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,734
(woman #1) What did he do that for?

487
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:44,791
(woman #2) Oh, that's a shame.

488
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:45,858
(Brett) Pay up.

489
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,029
(man #1) That ain't
nothing. Why you all...

490
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,572
(man #2) Look out, Brett.

491
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,336
(man #4) Get out of the way.

492
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,676
[people clamoring]

493
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:53,733
[grunting]

494
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,378
No, Dick.

495
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,617
Everybody just stay in their seats.

496
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:05,346
Just keep eating your vittles,
Mr. Campeau, with both hands.

497
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,813
[groaning]

498
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,849
[all chattering]

499
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,027
(man #2) Use your feet.

500
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,993
[women exclaiming]

501
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,833
[gun firing]

502
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,203
You weasel.

503
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,730
One at a time, gentlemen,
you'll all get your turn.

504
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,340
[people clamoring]

505
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,558
[people chattering]

506
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,329
There's the man. Now,
what's going on here?

507
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,334
What are you fellas trying
to... Conductor, stop the train.

508
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,097
One of my men got thrown off.

509
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,331
Thrown off? Where? Don't
pull that cord, Conductor.

510
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,874
But Mr. Campeau said...
This train doesn't stop.

511
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,502
All right.

512
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,278
That shot didn't just kill an Indian.

513
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,805
It killed a dozen white men, and
scalped and tortured women and children.

514
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:06,873
Tsk.

515
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,947
What's a dead Indian, more or less?

516
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,455
The Army's been killing them for years.

517
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,391
The Army doesn't kill
Indians for fun, Campeau.

518
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,325
And I don't think you do, either.

519
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,126
He's sure gonna be unpopular.

520
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,827
Not with me.

521
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,982
[men chattering]

522
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,586
[train bell ringing]

523
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,763
[workers chattering]

524
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,138
(man) Get along.

525
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,935
[men chattering]

526
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,774
Thank you kindly. Good
day to you, Shamus.

527
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,285
Good day, Paddy.

528
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,718
'Tis news of me wife I've
come for, Mollie Monahan.

529
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,551
I've no letter for you, Paddy.

530
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,826
Why don't you send for her?

531
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,760
I've all but $20 of the passage money.

532
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,127
I'm on me way to the
Big Tent to win that.

533
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,598
Sure, Paddy, you fool.
You can't win at Campeau's.

534
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,165
I can't lose.

535
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,965
Only this morning...

536
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,299
I found this shamrock in
a prayer book she sent me.

537
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,604
Now, the shamrock's not
for that kind of luck.

538
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,074
Wait till you see.

539
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,112
(barker) One man's money is as
good as another's in the Big Tent.

540
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,879
Step right in, my friends.

541
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,977
If you don't feel
like taking a chance...

542
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,989
there's plenty of
dancing, at $1 a couple.

543
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,458
$1 a couple and there's
sweet music on the house.

544
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,730
Step right up, my friends,
and enjoy your luck.

545

##[band playing music]

546
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,648
Don't lean on my chair.
It's bad luck. Get away.

547
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,412
It's not your rightful card.
You took it off the bottom.

548
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,715
Say that again.

549
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,120
I'll clout it into your thieving head.

550
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,093
Stay where you are. (Paddy)
With me own two eyes...

551
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,184
I saw you slip it off...

552
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,250

553
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,318

[band stop playing]

555
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,762
(Paddy) You dirty blackguard.

556
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:36,856
[groaning]

557
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,330
The music. It stopped right with it.

558
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,397
Jeff.

559
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,007
Nothing I can do for him.

560
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,848
Where's his gun? He had none...

561
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,689
and he couldn't shoot one if he had.

562
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,220
(man #1) Who got plugged?

563
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,286
(man #2) Just some Irish tracklayer.

564
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,057
(man #3) Is he dead yet?

565
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,122
(man #4) I don't know.

566
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,032
Who was it? Oh, the pity of it all.

567
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,661
It was Paddy O'Rourke.

568
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,073
(Leach) One side, gentlemen,
please. Easy there.

569
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,899
Paddy.

570
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,737
Paddy O'Rourke.

571
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,784
The letter, Mollie. It came?

572
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,109
The letter?

573
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,050
From Nora.

574
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:35,848
Yes, Paddy.

575
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,561
Paddy's letter.

576
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,728
Could you be reading it to me?

577
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,907
Sure, Paddy.

578
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,480
Paddy, my darling...

579
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,544
my...

580
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,195
my heart's so full of
love for you, sure...

581
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,564
sure 'tis spilling out of me eyes.

582
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,266
'Tis such an impatient
husband you are, Paddy, but...

583
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,565
after all the work and worry is done...

584
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,767
we'll be together again.

585
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,446
And there will be no night...

586
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,048
nor day between us...

587
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,377
at all.

588
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,914
"No night...

589
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,825
"nor day between us."

590
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,356
Nora.

591
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,186
A lad lies murdered, and
nothing will be done about it.

592
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,051
From a far country he came...

593
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,020
to do his little part
building the railway.

594
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,757
A great and good thing for us all.

595
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,499
And what will you tell his
widow, you men that run this...

596
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,903
this hell on wheels?

597
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,931
That's what it is.

598
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,902
A hell on wheels that claims a
man's life for every day in the year.

599
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,448
Here's a mite for the widow. Who's next?

600
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,880
Come on you Paddies, put it in the hat.

601
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,615
[men chattering]

602
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,416
(croupier) Twelve, red and even.

603
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,029
Don't touch that money. Why not?

604
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,101
I had that pot won. Maybe.

605
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,596
The hand wasn't played out, was it?

606
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:01,797
No. (man) No.

607
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,668
Which was Paddy's hand? This one.

608
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,977
Three treys.

609
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,910
Now deal yourself one.

610
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,614
Off the top.

611
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,619
A busted flush. Paddy wins.

612
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:28,426
Mollie Monahan. Keep your
hand above the table, Cordray.

613
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,958
I got manners. I'll
pick them up for you.

614
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:34,998
That belongs to Paddy's widow.

615
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,132
Leach! Take Mollie home.

616
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,699
Just as you say, Jeff, but
these fellas... Go ahead.

617
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,907
It is a fine thing you've done, Mr.
Butler. I'm thanking you for Paddy.

618
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,447
Come on, Mollie.

619
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,050
Clear out of Cheyenne, Cordray,
and keep off the UP right-of-way.

620
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,183
You got a big mouth, bucko.

621
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,617
Better keep it shut.

622
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,754
If you're not out of
this town in an hour...

623
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,857
one of us will keep his
mouth shut for a long time.

624
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,398
Come on, Jeff.

625
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,261
Let's go get a drink.

626
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:10,766
All right.

[woman screams]

629
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,630
(croupier) Number two. Black, even.

630
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,661
Say, you got eyes in
the back of your head?

631
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,599
I'm glad you keep that mirror clean.

632
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,206
He seen him in the looking glass.

633
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,936
(man #1) Doctor!
Somebody get that doctor!

634
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,705
(man #2) When Jeff shoots,
they don't need a doctor...

635
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,836
they need an undertaker.

636
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,312
(woman) Come on, boys! Drink up!

637

638
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,115
Keep your games going,
boys. Hit her up, Joe.

Not me. I'm staying.

644
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,589
Me, too.

(man) Let's go. I gotta go.

for a while. Come on.

Come on, you gandy dancers.
Get out there and go to work.

Free drinks, boys and girls.
Everybody have a drink on the house.

Board for End of Track.

655
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,995
There's not many men boarding
your work train, Jeff.

656
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,062
They'll be on it.

657
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,803
Are you going to clean out
the tent all by yourself?

658
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,935
Maybe.

659
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,141
I never thought one glass of
liquor would do that to you, Jeff.

660
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,944
But when the shooting
starts, let me know.

661
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,450
I'll be right over
there, dealing blackjack.

662
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,114
[laughs]

663
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,919
By doggies, I knowed
I'd miss all the fun.

664
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,590
Where's that good luck piece of yours?

665
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,461
Oh, you mean that gold nugget
I picked up out in California?

666
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,228
I got it here somewhere.

667
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,101
I always keep it with my knickknacks.

668
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,737
There it is, right there
in number five, Jeff.

669
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,910
Say, let me tell you how
I happened to pick that up.

670
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,471
How do you know that's real gold?

671
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,312
What do you know about gold nuggets?

672
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,248
Are you doubting that that's gold?

673
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,213
I wonder if there's any old-timer here
that knows real gold when he sees it.

674
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,280
I do.

675
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,050
Take a look at that.

676
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,533
That's gold, all right.
Where'd it come from?

677
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,865
Leach here picked it up at End of Track.

678
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,168
End of Track? A little
mite west of there.

679
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:57,899
Gold.

680
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,574
At End of Track?

681
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,105
Gold? Who found gold?

682
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,202
Who said "gold"? Gold?

683
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,269
What about gold?

684
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,678
(all) Gold!

685
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,909
(man #1) Who said "gold"?

686
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,382
They struck gold at End of Track!

687
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,043
He's found gold! (man
#2) What was that, gold?

688
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,886
Train for End of Track. Board!

[all shouting]

690
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,801
They found gold at End of Track.

691
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,394
Come back, you fools!
There's no gold! Come back!

693
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,210
Get them on that train
and keep them there.

694
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,186
I sure will. All right, Jeff.

00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,648
That puts you one up on me, bucko.

[train chugging]

702
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,761
Bucko's got a nice broad back.

703
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,827
Ain't he?

704
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,161
Hmm.

705
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,474
The way to get him ain't
with a gun. He's too fast.

706
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,582
Get me Duke Ring.

707
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,452
(Dick) # How I missed
her, how I missed her #

708
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,087
# How I missed my Clementine #

709
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,957
# Here I kissed her little sister #

710
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,693
# Then I forgot... ##

711
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,729
I'm looking for the lovely
postmistress of Hell on Wheels.

712
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,533
And what do you want to see her about?

713
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,574
About one of her little fingers.

714
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,342
The one she put in your eye
the first time you met her?

715
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,844
No. Not that one.

716
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,174
[both laugh]

717
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,976
Here, let me see them all.

718
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,112
That's too bad. What's
the matter with them?

719
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,346
No rings.

720
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,552
They'll catch cold. Rings!

721
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,956
Rings don't grow on trees.
Oh, no, not on trees.

722
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:33,463
<i>But there's a certain weed scientifically
known as the Ringus Weddingbellikus.</i>

723
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,925
Well, upon my soul.

724
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:47,966
[laughing]

725
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,776
'Tis some more of your black
magic, but gorry it's beautiful.

726
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,750
Grown especially for this finger.

727
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,619
No. You'd be pulling a wedding
bell out from under the next rail.

728
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,660
Well, keep it till your
finger changes its mind.

729
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,530
'Tis too much of a...

730
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,038
'Tis too much of a temptation, but...

731
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,944
the offer deserves thanking.

732
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:39,120
Wait. And what will the bold
Captain over there be thinking?

733
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,622
Hey!

734
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,999
(Mollie) Hey, hold on
there! Good morning.

735
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,003
Please, and who gave you
the right to use my handcar?

736
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,408
Oh, I thought it belonged
to the railroad. Hello, Dick.

737
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,912
It's mine to deliver
mail at the End of Track.

738
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,812
You going to End of Track? I am.

739
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,009
[train approaching] So am I!

740
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,382
[train whistle blowing]

741
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,088
That puts you two up on me, bucko.

742
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,868
Is it that you can't talk when
there's no gun in your hand?

743
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:22,494
Maybe.

744
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,336
'Tis a fine job you've done
in a few months, Mr. Jeff.

745
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,277
Restoring a bit of order
along the right-of-way.

746
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,373
It must give great pride
to your lady back in...

747
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,954
in Boston.

748
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,689
Is she your wife?

749
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,015
No.

750
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,184
[sighing]

751
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,626
Be like it's some sparrow's
got hold of your heart.

752
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,266
Is she very beautiful? Very.

753
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,304
And does she love you
very much? Very much.

754
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,400
Now how about delivering your mail?

755
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,012
The wind just whisked it out of me hand.

756
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,978
Well, seems a word from her is
more important than your business.

757
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,246
Yes. She's my mother.

758
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,586
Oh, 'tis sorry I am, Mr.
Jeff, and ashamed, besides.

759
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,995
[buffalo snorting]

760
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,806
Get back! Get back! Get back to the car!

761
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,678
[snorting]

762
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:42,678
Gorry, what are we getting
into? Come on, Jeff, run for it!

763
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,422
At least, now, you'll have plenty
of time to read your letter.

764
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,159
Yeah. If one of the
buffalo doesn't want a ride.

765
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,167
Your mother worries a great
deal about you, I'm thinking.

766
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,214
With all the fighting and
killing you're mixed up in.

767
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,413
I didn't know when I started.

768
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,109
What didn't you know?

769
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,779
No, you wouldn't be interested.

770
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,785
Captain, I've reached the point of being
fair crazy trying to understand you.

771
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,657
Mind if I smoke? That's what I mean.

772
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:31,758
The manners of a gentleman, the smile
of a boy, and the quick hand of a gunman.

773
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:36,636
Now. Now, however did you get started
on a career of death and destruction?

774
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:41,440
I couldn't decide between being a pirate
and a fireman, so took up engineering.

775
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,877
Driving an engine?

776
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,004
[grunts]

777
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,446
Get out of there!

778
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,974
No, building bridges and things.

779
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,612
But along came the war...

780
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,282
And they needed your guns
more than your bridges.

781
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,155
My dreams went up in smoke.

782
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,156
Then there's much in
common between us, Mr. Jeff.

783
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,832
How's that, Mollie?

784
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,732
Both of us seem to be wanting
things that don't want us.

785
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:12,141
You seemed to be getting what you
wanted just before we got on this car.

786
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,604
Oh, Dick.

787
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,952
I know. You think I'm an
outrageous flirt. Well?

788
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,955
But did you never know that
flirting gets into a woman's blood...

789
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,752
like fighting gets into a man's?

790
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:32,228
Now, a girl begins coquetting
to discover if she has the power.

791
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,798
Then she goes looking, like
a fighter after a bully...

792
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,858
for the hardest man to conquer.

793
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,264
But 'tis never the man she wants...

794
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,568
'tis the pleasure of
bringing him to her feet.

795
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:49,410
Till the right man comes along and
gives her the spanking she deserves.

796
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,539
That's the man she dreams of.

797
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,544
And the man she kisses.

798
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,556
The buffalo are most gone, and I'm
thinking we'd better be going, too.

799
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:06,357
We might have harnessed a couple
and had them pull us to End of Track.

800
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,212
[whistle tooting]

801
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,608
[bell ringing]

802
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,188
[men chattering]

803
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,238
(man) Rail!

804
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,751
[all chattering]

805
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,430
Rail!

806
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,613
Bend your backs to it!

807
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,417
(Dusky) Lay ahold of
that rail, me lad...

808
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,620
you're slowing us down.

809
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,291
Sure, if I was your mother, I'd be
ashamed of the strength you have.

810
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,061
'Tis the whiskey you
drank in Cheyenne...

811
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,466
not the work you're doing here
that gave you such a thirst.

812
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,698
Get along with you! Any trouble, Dusky?

813
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:56,761
Trouble?

814
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,241
Say, what was the matter with them crazy
muckers you sent out here the other day?

815
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,334
Why?

816
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,209
All over the hillside they
started digging for gold.

817
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,908
Found plenty iron, huh?

818
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:09,747
And they're laying three miles
of it a day, pay or no pay.

819
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,648
Hey, what is this I hear about
the railroad brass hats coming up?

820
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,249
Inspection tour. General
Grant's with them.

821
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,788
He'd win a lot of votes
in the next election...

822
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,557
by bringing our pay along with him.

823
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,620
He will.

824
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,226
Come on. Move it ahead.

825
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,824
[bell ringing]

826
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,696
Here's one to mail,
Mollie. Give it here.

827
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:32,105
Mollie, did my cousin from
Cork write? No, she didn't.

828
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,802
Any mail, Mollie? It is sorry, I am.

829
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,708
(woman) Have you got a letter
for us? No. Mrs. Cassidy.

830
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:36,939
(woman) Saint's alive! Who's dead?

831
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,505
Mrs. Hogan, I hear your
new baby came yesterday.

832
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,711
And a fine broth of a boy he
is, too. Shouldn't you be in bed?

833
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,277
Well, I had a mind to
stay in bed this morning...

834
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,051
but there was the washing to
do, so I says to meself, I says:

835
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,094
"Now, this is no time for playing sick."

836
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,560
What're you going to name the baby?

837
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:56,656
Union Pacific Hogan. Was
that your husband's idea?

838
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,399
Mike? Sure he's after going
to Cheyenne to celebrate.

839
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,303
The lad'll be half-grown
by the time he sobers up.

840
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,362
[laughs]

841
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,908
[bell clanging]

842
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,278
Injuns! Get the kids in!

843
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,441
[women clamoring]

844
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,818
Redskins!

845
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,548
(man) To your posts,
men! Get ready for action!

846
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:21,790
Hold your fire till they get closer.

847
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,921
[all chattering]

848
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,664
There's only two of them.

849
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,362
And they look like my men.

850
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,379
I smell worse trouble than Injuns.

851
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,939
Get back to work, you mollycoddles...

852
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,350
or I'll be banging on somebody's
pants with me pick-handle.

853
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,181
(man) Get back to the job, you terriers!

854
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,263
(Fiesta) We got plenty
troubles this time, Captain.

855
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:08,065
You know that Andy Calahan, the
foreman over at the grader's camp?

856
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,072
Yeah. What about him?

857
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,970
Nothing, only he's dead.

858
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:13,967
How?

859
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,672
Fella named Duke Ring
sort of lost his temper.

860
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,443
Yeah. Now, nobody's working at all.

861
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,108
But they gotta work.

862
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,419
We can't lay track if there's no grade.

863
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,547
Couple of hundred of them over
there yowling about no pay...

864
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,090
so we didn't start nothing.

865
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:32,254
I'll go on up and entertain Mr.
Ring. Back by sundown, maybe.

866
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:36,026
You better take us with you,
Jefferson. That foreman is awful dead.

867
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,129
Dusky! Dusky Clayton!

868
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,934
Would you give me the loan of this
team to take mail to the graders' camp?

869
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,443
That's no place for you
to be going now. Thanks.

870
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,405
Sorry, Mollie. Hey, what's this?

871
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,879
[bell ringing]

872
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,042
Well, by the soles of me feet!

873
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,725
What're you working for?

874
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,635
It ain't money because
you don't get none.

875
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,962
Are you working for your sweat?

876
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,605
That's all you'll get out of it.

877
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:23,407
Unless some Injun comes along
and tears the hair off your head.

878
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,448
Whoa.

879
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,887
[hammering]

880
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:37,954
Give me that.

881
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,764
That's Duke Ring.

882
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,763
You ain't gonna need this.

883
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,766
Oakes Ames would hate to see
his shovels used like that.

884
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:55,803
Wait here.

885
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,777
'Tis suicide you're contemplating,
going against that mob.

886
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,078
Maybe. Jeff.

887
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,983
No one's ever put any
sense into a man's brain...

888
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,182
through a bullet hole in his head.

889
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,082
Maybe you're right.

890
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,394
Whatever happens...

891
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,363
you keep out of it.

892
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,337
The fool ain't got a gun on him.

893
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,008
Hello, boys!

894
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,474
Where's your foreman?

895
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,214
Your foreman was a fine fellow.

896
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,629
This bruiser taking his place?

897
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,732
What're you going to do about it, bucko?

898
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,892
Nothing, Mr. Ring...

899
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:58,301
if these men are fools enough to
believe a lying windbag like you.

900
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,873
Lying, am I?

901
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,275
Have you been paid for
two months or ain't you?

902
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,574
(all) No.

903
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:08,778
Sure, sure. You've all got
wages coming. So have I.

904
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,480
We'll get every cent that's due us.

905
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,819
The railroad won't pay
you for sitting around...

906
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,017
watching Mr. Ring break shovels.

907
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,217
Now, let's go to work.

908
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,728
That sounds like horse sense.

909
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:22,859
Oh, does it?

910
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:33,538
I'll kill the first man
to move a shovel of earth.

911
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,449
You'll go out of here feet first, bucko.

912
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,952
[grunting]

913
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,613
[all laughing]

914
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,267
I'm not there. I'm over here, Mr. Ring.

915
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,839
I see you, you stinking railroad cop.

916
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,105
Still here, Mr. Ring.

917
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,080
This way, Mr. Ring.

918
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,206
Well, mates, there's your bully.

919
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,043
Nobody can make you work.

920
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,773
But if you're through with the job...

921
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,645
get out of camp and make room
for men who do want to work.

922
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:50,042
Well, boys, it's 1:00.
That's still horse sense.

923
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,849
What are we waiting for? Come on, boys.

924
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,650
Come on, boys, bring your shovels.

925
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,689
(all) # I've been
working on the railroad #

926
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:58,750
[sighing]

927
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,262
# All the livelong day #

928
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:04,027
# I've been working on the railroad #

929
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,125
# Just to pass the time
away # Hit the ties, Ring.

930
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,931
And don't stop to say
goodbye to Campeau.

931
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,698
# Don't you hear the whistle blowing? #

932
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,809
# Rise up so early in the morn #

933
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,111
# Don't you hear the foreman shouting #

934
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,740
# Oh, Dinah, blow your horn #

935
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,511
Gorry, what a man.

936
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,552
# I've been working on the railroad #

937
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,451
# All the livelong ##

938
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,988
Can you see him?

939
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,358
Last time I seen him, I was shooting
at him from a huckleberry patch.

940
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,484
[laughing]

941
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:36,494
Plenty big talk, but no payroll.

942
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,194
(Ames) Such a move means
disaster, General Grant.

943
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,162
Our credit is stretched
to the breaking point.

944
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:47,073
An element, lawless beyond all
reason, hangs onto our coattails...

945
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,872
here at the End of Track.

946
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:53,004
It's like a monstrous conspiracy
determined to wreck the railroad.

947
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,541
And now Mr. Barrows proposes
a new survey west of Laramie.

948
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,578
Reputable engineers advise me
our present route is impractical.

949
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:03,490
I'd rather take the
advice of one old buffalo.

950
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,028
A buffalo? Oh, come now, General.

951
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:09,592
This railroad is being built
on an old buffalo trail.

952
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,191
Those animals are practical
travelers, Mr. Barrows.

953
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,964
And I never knew one that changed
his route for financial reasons.

954
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,836
And we can't do it and reach
Ogden before the Central.

955
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:22,134
My only concern, General Grant, is
to lay an honest stretch of track.

956
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,874
(Dodge) Mr. Barrows wants
90 miles of additional track.

957
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,179
If that is ordered, then I
must resign as Chief Engineer.

958
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,013
But, General Dodge...

959
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:35,353
The Government expects the company
to finish the railroad as contracted.

960
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,917
It also expects General
Dodge to remain in authority.

961
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,319
Mr. Ames.

962
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:46,159
How much money do you need
for immediate bills and wages?

963
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,667
At least a million dollars.

964
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,799
You seem to have the interest of the
road so deeply at heart, Mr. Barrows...

965
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:56,138
I suggest you lend Mr. Ames the money.

966
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,443
A million dollars? Yes.

967
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,942
For the Union Pacific.

968
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,281
I consider it a privilege
to serve the road...

969
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:10,292
and the next President
of the United States.

970
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:14,922
The first shipment of cash will
be sent before the week is over.

971
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,327
General. Gentlemen.

972
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,130
Thank you, General. Thank you.

973
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,193
(all) Thank you, General.

974
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,934
It takes money to put iron
over those mountains, General.

975
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,772
[people chattering]

976
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,910
(barker) Come on in, boys. An
equal cache for one and all.

977
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,451
Can I trouble you for a light, stranger?

978
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,044
Sure.

979
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,291
Shipment of money is coming
in on a special, Tuesday night.

980
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:52,559
Payroll, huh? Yes. I prefer
that it should not arrive.

981
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,264
How much?

982
00:57:56,339 --> 00:58:00,639
$200,000. My money. I
want most of it back.

983
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,573
We'll get it.

984
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,644
Thank you for the light, stranger.

985
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,213
[barker chattering]

986
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,089
(Campeau) The money belongs to Barrows.

987
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,490
So it ain't a real holdup.

988
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,259
Does Jeff Butler know that?

989
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,029
What if he don't?

990
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,530
Is there any reason why you wouldn't
plug that yellow-livered skunk?

991
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,373
Jeff and I aren't partners in this game.

992
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,242
I'd plug him...

993
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:37,874
as quick as he'd plug me.

994
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,940
But don't go calling him names.

995
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,478
You ought to call him a couple.

996
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:50,586
He's certainly got the whole
town giving you the horselaugh.

997
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,289
Yeah, he's...

998
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,024
two up on me right now.

999
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,898
Mollie seems to think so.

1000
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,902
Are you looking for
something between the eyes?

1001
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,705
[chuckling]

1002
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,637
After I lift that payroll...

1003
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,245
nobody's gonna laugh.

1004
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,254
Nobody but me.

1005
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,183
[train rumbling]

1006
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,562
So long, Art. Hello,
Jeff. Where are you from?

1007
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,491
Laramie. What's there?

1008
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,434
Nothing. Tomorrow it'll be a city.

1009
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,735
They're packing up Cheyenne
now and loading it on the cars.

1010
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:40,401
Will you have a cup of tea while
I'm patching Monahan's pants?

1011
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:44,344
No, thanks. But I'll sit on your
front porch till the special gets in.

1012
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,143
Special? Who's on it?

1013
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,548
Old John Dough. Jeff,
it's never the payroll?

1014
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,985
I could do a jig for joy.

1015
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,614
[train approaching]

1016
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,182
I've sat on quieter front porches.

1017
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,989
And you've spooned on them
with better company, no doubt.

1018
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,433
Not better company.

1019
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,899
I'll dust the blarney
off that and be thankful.

1020
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,805
There's no blarney
between you and me, Mollie.

1021
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:16,676
I often wonder if I'll ever have
any other front porch than this.

1022
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,044
Someday you'll have your
house anchored under you.

1023
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,343
I don't know.

1024
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:25,684
I've never lived without wheels under
me head when I lay me down to sleep.

1025
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:30,023
You'll be darning socks for
some happy man before long.

1026
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,194
I hope his heart won't
be far from the rails.

1027
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,368
And where do you think you'll
spend your declining years?

1028
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,800
I probably won't have
any declining years.

1029
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,965
Don't say such a thing.

1030
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,477
You change the night to fear
and the wind from warm to cold.

1031
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,341
Feel my hand, 'tis ice.

1032
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,608
In my job, Mollie...

1033
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,645
a man can't look very far ahead.

1034
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,851
Maybe when the road's done, I...

1035
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,424
What do you mean, the wind's cold?

1036
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,492
There isn't any wind.

1037
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,365
'Tis no ordinary wind. 'Tis
the kind that witches ride on.

1038
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,907
It blows trouble.

1039
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,142
If you'll are making any promises
dealing with the future...

1040
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,807
you're taking a lot for granted.

1041
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:28,908
What's up?

1042
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,352
Well, sir, it might be a sewing
bee, and it might be a hayride...

1043
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:36,916
but there's eight of Sid Campeau's top
gunfighters missing from the Big Tent.

1044
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:40,190
Is Dick with them? I reckon
he is. He ain't there.

1045
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,764
Hey, Jeff! Yeah.

1046
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,924
Eight horses, they're
gone from Campeau's corral.

1047
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:48,903
Could you pick up their trail? The
Mexican boy said they ride east.

1048
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,769
Maybe the Injuns is
giving an ice-cream social.

1049
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,401
Pay train. That's what I figured.

1050
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,972
Mollie, run for the telegraph office.

1051
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,877
Tell Calvin to stop the
pay train at Pine Bluff.

1052
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,916
Leach, get an engine and
a flatcar. I sure will.

1053
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,008
Put our horses on the flatcar
and round up a few men.

1054
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:06,021
You bet yourself. We
have good time tonight.

1055
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:08,951
[bell ringing]

1056
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,885
[telegraph tapping]

1057
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:13,620
Oh, dear.

1058
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,794
Pay train went through
Pine Bluff 10 minutes ago...

1059
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,803
gathering speed for
the Pole Creek Divide.

1060
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:25,568
Calvin, get that chief dispatcher
over here. Take the key, Mollie.

1061
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,707
Try Egbert Siding. Oh, no.
It is closed after 6:00.

1062
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,771
Maybe Joe's playing solitaire.
Try anyway and keep trying.

1063
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,316
I'll see you later.

1064
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,975
The saints ride with you, Jeff.

1065
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,056
[whistle tooting] (Jeff)
Let her go, Clancey!

1066
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,615
[bell ringing]

1067
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:10,277
Let the silver lay. It's too
heavy. Not for me, it ain't.

1068
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:18,453
There's the headlights.

1069
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,090
Slow her down.

1070
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,963
(bandit) Train coming from the West!

1071
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,268
All right, boys. Let's get out of here.

1072
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,470
(man) Whoa.

1073
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:58,397
Split up! Every man for himself.

1074
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,204
Each of you, pick a man.

1075
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,504
[laughing]

1076
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,312
We got good fun, eh?

1077
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,981
That all depends. Yeah.

1078
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,043
[laughing]

1079
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:22,083
[gun firing]

1080
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,496
[gun firing]

1081
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,608
[steam hissing]

1082
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,702
[bell ringing]

1083
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,723
[glass shattering]

1084
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,823
What in the name of...

1085
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,165
Tell Campeau to send a couple
of men over to this car. Run!

1086
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:15,828
Gee, sure.

1087
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,174
Why do you throw mail
through the window?

1088
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,739
Hide that or you'll have a
killing on your front porch.

1089
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,012
What's happening?

1090
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:31,514
Quick. Well...

1091
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:33,581
[horse approaching]

1092
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,123
Hiya, Jeff. Where's the fire?

1093
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,955
Man ride by here just now? Yeah.

1094
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,795
You can still see his dust.

1095
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,163
You can get him with a little...

1096
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:47,395
hard riding.

1097
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:49,426
Thanks.

1098
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,300
You been here long?

1099
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:58,235
Just waiting for a cup of
tea and a kiss from Mollie.

1100
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:01,978
I'll join you.

1101
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:03,878
For the tea.

1102
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,648
[train whistle blowing]

1103
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,084
[knocking on door]

1104
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,053
Come in. Come in.

1105
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:18,422
Hello, Mollie.

1106
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,600
So it's the pair of you.

1107
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,035
Can we give this bucko
some tea? Sure, sure. But...

1108
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,972
Did you get to the
pay train in time? No.

1109
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,848
Well, what happened?

1110
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,382
Who broke your window? Oh, I...

1111
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,288
[laughing] Monahan must be back.

1112
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:48,326
No, some gandy dancer feeling his
liquor was throwing a bottle at the moon.

1113
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,399
What'd you do with it?

1114
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:58,067
Do with what? The bottle.

1115
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,543
Sure, now, I think
you're both a bit cracked.

1116
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,844
Much of a crowd at the
Big Tent tonight, Dick?

1117
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,647
I don't know. I was
out at the End of Track.

1118
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,553
The dirt at the End of
Track is white gypsum.

1119
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,550
You've got the same dust
on your boots I have.

1120
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:22,256
It's red. Like a rose, huh?

1121
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,596
More like the ground where
the pay train was held up.

1122
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:28,660
Now, don't tell me they
got away with the payroll.

1123
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,799
You should have asked that
fellow that rode by here.

1124
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:35,776
Well, say, that's mighty
serious for the railroad.

1125
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,744
Where were you, Jeff?

1126
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,518
Now drink your tea, and
you'll both be feeling easier.

1127
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,251
How much did they get? A mail sack full.

1128
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,758
A mail sack?

1129
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,465
Will you drink your tea and stop
staring like there was bullets in it.

1130
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:04,662
Well, out here, Mollie, you never can
tell where you're gonna find a bullet.

1131
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,834
That's right. A man
can't even trust a friend.

1132
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,781
Hello.

1133
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,387
There's no letters for you, I'm
not boiling tea for the house...

1134
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,020
and we don't want to
make up a male quartet.

1135
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,759
Captain Butler's a little
upset over a pay train holdup.

1136
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,394
Too bad, bucko. Somebody
put one over on you?

1137
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,700
Maybe.

1138
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:44,406
You've had your refreshment, Jeff,
and now you'll want to be traveling...

1139
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,141
after the robbers.

1140
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:48,450
Sounds like good advice.

1141
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,414
Maybe.

1142
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,521
Lost something? No.

1143
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:04,692
I just thought I might find the
bottle that broke that window.

1144
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,633
You know, there's a
fellow named Pullman...

1145
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:14,335
that just invented a new kind
of bunk that folds up like this.

1146
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,825
(Dick) Curiosity
killed a cat once, Jeff.

1147
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,000
You'd better say good night.

1148
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:47,500
Why? You leaving? No.

1149
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,608
But you are. This is Mollie's
place, and she told you to get out.

1150
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:58,511
Hold your yelps, all of you.

1151
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:05,820
Never in me whole life have I
seen two such outrageous fortunes.

1152
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,925
Sit down, Jeff, and look
what's in store for you.

1153
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,228
The little leaves, all
crooked and helter-skelter.

1154
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,997
Now, they tell you of life
and love and hope and grieving.

1155
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,904
Will the tea leaves tell me
everything that's in this car, Mollie?

1156
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:20,964
No.

1157
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,499
(Mollie) No, they...

1158
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,008
They're warning you to get moving...

1159
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,844
or you'll be taking the long
journey on a one-way ticket.

1160
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,581
What do you see in mine?

1161
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,751
(Dick) A girl with Irish eyes?

1162
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,453
About your size?

1163
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,796
No, I see two horns and a pointed tail.

1164
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,830
I feel that cold witches' wind, Mollie.

1165
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,795
How about some wood on the fire?

1166
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,440
Don't let your hand slip, bucko.

1167
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,937
That's your second mistake, Dick.

1168
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:03,007
What was the first? Sending for help.

1169
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,047
What are you waiting for,
Dick? Let him have it.

1170
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:07,787
Dick, wait.

1171
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:08,845
Will you...

1172
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:12,193
Will you look at this now?
This circle in your cup here.

1173
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,395
Does it look like a noose? No.

1174
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,063
It looks like a ring.

1175
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,905
A wedding ring? Well,
now, maybe it does...

1176
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:28,170
but let's not be talking about
it until after Jeff is gone.

1177
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:32,944
Does it look like this one, that was made
for the third finger of your left hand?

1178
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:36,411
Why...

1179
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,193
If this prying troubleshooter
ever gets out of me house...

1180
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,357
I'll tell you, it's... It's yes.

1181
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,460
Mollie.

1182
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,766
Dick's been with me all evening
waiting to plight me his troth.

1183
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,497
Dick's been with you? Yes.

1184
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,739
Now, will you please go home?

1185
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,515
Or are you waiting to
see it sealed with a kiss?

1186
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:11,518
[laughing]

1187
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,617
Did you hear that, bucko? Yes.

1188
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,224
I heard it.

1189
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:32,232
I'll be on me oath there's
no money here but $6.70...

1190
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:35,037
in the cash drawer, and I'm
keeping Monahan's savings...

1191
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,737
sewn up in the mattress.

1192
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,343
Will you swear to that by
the little cross you wear?

1193
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,781
Yes, I...

1194
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,316
I must have lost it.

1195
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:49,921
But I swear by what's
dear on this earth...

1196
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,928
and by all the love that's in me...

1197
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,592
and...

1198
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:03,595
Please go, Jeff, there's
nothing in this car you want.

1199
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,770
I guess that's right.

1200
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,511
[Mollie sobbing]

1201
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:18,018
Mollie, my darling, you were glorious.

1202
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,956
Me heart's still
jigging on me back teeth.

1203
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,220
Where'd you hide it? Me heart?

1204
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:31,992
No, I know where that
is. I mean the pay sack.

1205
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,037
The pay sack?

1206
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,896
Now what would I be
doing with a pay sack?

1207
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,306
Quit the blarney and turn it
over while you're still able.

1208
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,072
Threaten a Monahan, would you? If
I knew, I wouldn't be telling you!

1209
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,670
[chuckling] Don't hurt him, Mollie.

1210
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,074
All right now, clear
out, the both of you.

1211
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,812
Tell Campeau I'll be there pronto.

1212
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,854
Maybe I'd better stay
and help you with it.

1213
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,980
I carried it quite a
way without your help.

1214
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:56,849
Out.

1215
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,122
[sniffling]

1216
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,224
[sighing]

1217
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:11,431
First it's me heart,
and now it's me knees.

1218
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,373
Where does Monahan keep his
Rule G? On top of the shelf.

1219
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:21,382
How long will it take you to pack?

1220
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,181
Why did you do it, Dick?

1221
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,883
We've a lifetime together
to talk about that.

1222
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,853
Suppose we find out first...

1223
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,498
if they've got lakes in
Ireland the color of your eyes?

1224
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,329
Take off your sweet lip
and say what you're meaning.

1225
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:42,870
Or if you'd rather stay in America...

1226
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,772
there's New York, St.
Louis, San Francisco.

1227
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:49,811
And there's General Casement's
car across the tracks.

1228
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,411
What do you mean? Back it
goes. Every penny of it.

1229
01:15:56,218 --> 01:16:00,211
I'll not be helping you rob the railroad
that's been mother and son to me.

1230
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,854
You're crazy, Mollie.

1231
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,219
Do you know what there is in that sack?

1232
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:10,223
Champagne and carriages
and pretty dresses...

1233
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,166
and a good time for
the rest of our lives.

1234
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,893
There's nearly $200,000 in cash.

1235
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,601
Use your wits, man.

1236
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,768
Do you think you could
travel one mile with it now?

1237
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,846
Jeff Butler suspicions you. The
whole railroad will be after you.

1238
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:28,041
The only chance of saving your
neck is to return it yourself.

1239
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,381
Me? You.

1240
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:36,584
Or you'll be dancing with your feet off
the ground, and that's not a pretty sight.

1241
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,223
Not for a bride on her wedding day.

1242
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,930
I love you, Mollie.

1243
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,398
I believe you do.

1244
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:55,905
But there'll be no talk of a
wedding till you've done as I say.

1245
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,815
It's the first time I've ever
discarded aces for a queen.

1246
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,858
Where's the money? You're sitting on it.

1247
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:20,558
Nobody knew the money was on that
train but you, Casement, and myself.

1248
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:22,068
And Campeau.

1249
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,829
How did he find out? I don't know.

1250
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:30,607
Campeau's partner is a close
friend of yours, isn't he?

1251
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,541
He was.

1252
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,075
I want that payroll, Butler.

1253
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,185
(Reed) Or I want your resignation.

1254
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,977
Good evening, gentlemen.

1255
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,854
'Tis sorry I am to be interrupting
you, General, but this belongs to you.

1256
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,154
To me? What is it? The payroll.

1257
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,252
The payroll? The payroll? What?

1258
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,990
Where'd you get it?
'Twas like this, I was...

1259
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,624
Wait. How did you know it was
the payroll? By the bullet holes.

1260
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,190
I wasn't shooting as badly as I thought.

1261
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:54,257
Sure, that explains it.

1262
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,134
The poor bandit running for shelter,
dropping the bag from weakness...

1263
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,732
with your bullets in his back. The
bullets didn't go through the bag.

1264
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,940
Where did you find it? Well, Mr.
Allen and I were taking a walk...

1265
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,345
there's such a beautiful moon
tonight... Never mind the moon.

1266
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,179
How long have you
been with Miss Monahan?

1267
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,513
Not long enough.

1268
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,577
Watch your talk, Allen. We intend
to hang the man who did this job.

1269
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:16,613
No fooling.

1270
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,057
Mollie, how did you come by this?

1271
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,491
Well, now, I'll not remember a thing...

1272
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,394
if you all keep charging at
me like a bull at red flannels.

1273
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,658
Go on.

1274
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:27,668
Well, we were taking some tea
over to Grandpa O'Shaughnessy...

1275
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,465
Grandpa O'Shaughnessy
has drunk nothing...

1276
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,733
but straight whiskey
since the war of 1812.

1277
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,299
Well, except when he's got
the misery in his back...

1278
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,038
and then he puts one part of
tea to seven parts of whiskey.

1279
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:40,411
Miss Monahan, are you telling
the truth? Well, not quite.

1280
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:45,117
As a matter of fact, we were on our way to
Father Ryan's to talk about getting married.

1281
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,711
(Casement) Getting married? You two?

1282
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:48,483
Yeah, show him your ring, Mollie.

1283
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,589
I'm waiting to hear
where you found the money.

1284
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,787
On the tracks near Mollie's car.

1285
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:58,593
How near? As near as
you might throw a stone.

1286
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,761
Or a bottle? Well, anyway,
we brought it right here...

1287
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,168
didn't we? Yes.

1288
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:06,105
Before we even talked to
Father Ryan about our wedding...

1289
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,232
in the morning.

1290
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:13,539
Yes. Mollie, it's a medal
you deserve for this...

1291
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:14,877
as well as congratulations.

1292
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,783
I agree with General Casement, but
the wedding will have to be tonight.

1293
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:20,014
But there's no great
hurry. Sure, there is.

1294
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,112
We're moving up to Laramie...

1295
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,487
and Father Ryan's church will
be on a flatcar in two hours.

1296
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:27,494
You gonna be best man, bucko?
(Reed) Captain Butler has work to do.

1297
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,866
I want the man who
robbed that train, Butler.

1298
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,799
Yes, sir.

1299
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,435
I hope you deserve her, Dick.

1300
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,804
We're all very grateful
to you, Miss Monahan.

1301
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,278
Now, Mollie, what can we do for you?

1302
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:46,439
(Reed) I'll tell you
what we can do for her.

1303
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,779
We'll give her a wedding tonight
that'll go down in history.

1304
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,250
I wouldn't want to be
putting you to that trouble.

1305
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:52,479
We could wait until...
(Casement) Trouble?

1306
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:53,612
I'll drive you to the church myself.

1307
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:54,814
(Reed) That's little enough.

1308
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,187
Why, she saved our bacon.

1309
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,283
Mollie, you've saved the railroad.

1310
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,922
[bell ringing]

1311
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:01,656
[people chattering]

1312
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,262
(man #1) The church goes
on the next train, George.

1313
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,331
(man #2) Hey, lend us your hammer.

1314
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,494
(man #1) The board house comes now.

1315
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,197
(foreman) All right,
Donovan. Come on, O'Toole.

1316
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,762
Don't take all week.

1317
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,735
(man #1) McGukkin's a
sound sleeper, ain't he?

1318
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,506
Hot or cold, he goes.

1319
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:25,178
Murder alive! If you wanted to come in,
why in blazes didn't you knock at the door?

1320
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:28,154
Leave hold of it, Mike.
Everything goes to Laramie.

1321
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:31,885
And where is Laramie? It's
wherever we set down this town.

1322
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,086
[bell clanging]

1323
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,255
All right, boys, come on, we'll
take the block. The roof comes next.

1324
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,094
All right, Sullivan.

1325
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:40,091
Come on, take the block.

# Baby, fare thee well #

1329
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,403
(woman) Where's Jeff Butler
taking them tracklayers?

1330
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:50,535

going, they mean business.

1332

# But the only thing
that satisfies her #

1337
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:03,821
# Is a good big drink of gin #

1338

What is that? The Irish are coming.

1342
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:19,072
Jake, give him a free drink. Okay.

1343
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,232
Keep the ball rolling.

1347
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,784
Hello, Campeau.

1348
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,953
I hear you're moving to Laramie.

1349
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,025
What about it?

1350
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:43,254
Go on over in the corner and turn
your back and keep your hands up.

1351
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:47,301
Come on back. You've got visitors.

1352
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:59,105
[woman screaming] One
yelp and you'll get the ax!

01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:03,506
Get over here!

1356
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,678
(Dusky) That's what
claps me ax through skull.

1357
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:07,888
(man #1) Don't you reach for your gun.

1358
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:11,352
(man #2) Who do you
think you're shoving?

1359
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,324
Get those Irish
clodhoppers out of my place.

1360
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:18,889
They just came down to help you move.

1361
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:24,129
Fiesta, take Mr. Campeau in there.

1362
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:28,400
Please. (man) Get one for me, Jeff.

1363

1364
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:34,911
Leach, watch the door.

1365
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,627
Come on, boys. Free
drinks for everybody.

1367
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,060
Nobody ain't drinking, Jake.

Ain't you heard the
Irish is teetotalers?

[crowd laughing]

1370
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:02,599
It's the first time I've heard about it.

1371
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:05,175
Who held up that train, Campeau?

1372
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,979
How should I know?

1373
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,045
What'd he say, Fiesta?

1374
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:18,559
He say, pretty soon he
will tell you all about it.

1375
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:26,700
[Fiesta chuckling]

1376
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,201
Pretty soon.

1377
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:33,740
There were eight horses missing
from your corral. Where'd they go?

1378
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,541
I don't know. Somebody
must have borrowed them.

1379
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:43,173
Did you hear that, Fiesta?
Sure. You bet yourself.

1380
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,717
Sure, I hear.

1381
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:54,228
He say he think he knows
who take those horse.

1382
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,699
Who rode those horses? I don't know.

1383
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,440
I ain't left the tent tonight.

1384
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:16,140
Look here, Butler.

1385
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:19,644
You and your railroad
cutthroat can't bully me.

1386
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,849
He called you a cutthroat, Fiesta.

1387
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:24,118
[laughing]

1388
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,490
He knows me pretty well.

1389
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,536
Who led those men?

1390
01:24:37,772 --> 01:24:40,172
Butler, you're nailing
the lid on your own coffin.

1391
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:44,200
Dick nailed the lid on yours
tonight. I ain't seen Dick.

1392
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:49,375
Then you didn't know he turned
the money back to the railroad.

1393
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,583
I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,884
He sold you out to
the railroad, Campeau.

1395
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:57,220
That's what you get for
picking a man in love.

1396
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,721
You're lying. He turned the
payroll over to Casement.

1397
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:05,357
I saw Dick give that girl a ring,
and she promised to marry him.

1398
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,765
Looks like you're the
sucker this time, Campeau.

1399
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,596
Now you talk.

1400
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:21,347
All right, all right. What's
it to me? I wasn't there.

1401
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:25,644
Sure. Dick stuck up the train.

1402
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,548
What am I supposed to
do about it? Nothing.

1403
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:33,182
Just come with me. You, too.

1404
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:36,487
[yelping]

1405
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:37,929
I'm going.

1406
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:41,566
I declare, it won't seem natural
in Laramie without you boys.

1407
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:42,625
[coughing]

1408
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:45,566
Don't reach for your
handkerchief, Brett.

1409
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,302
Just use your sleeve if
you want to wipe your mouth.

1410
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:50,207
[crowd laughing]

1411
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:54,540
Leach, the mule's ready? Yeah.

1412
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:57,608
You and Fiesta take all the dealers
outside and get them started.

1413
01:25:58,419 --> 01:25:59,750
[Fiesta laughing] Yeah.

1414
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,755
And here. Don't forget this rat.

1415
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:06,091
Sure, we have big fun with him.

1416
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:07,150
[Fiesta laughing]

1417
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:11,698
For every crack of that
half-breed's whip...

1418
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:14,132
I'll put a bullet through
that pig's hide of yours.

1419
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:15,226
[crowd chattering]

1420
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,203
(man) Come out from
under the table, you.

1421
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:20,868
Dusky Clayton, it's all yours.

1422
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,068
(man) Take your hands off me.

1423
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:25,738
Spit on your hands, you
terriers, and smash into it.

1424
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:26,802
Yeah! Yeah!

1425
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:28,143
[tables crashing]

1426
01:26:28,216 --> 01:26:29,945
[glass shattering]

1427
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:34,446
I hope Dick don't get you, Butler.

1428
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,118
[continue banging]

1429
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:40,554
I don't want nobody to get you but me.

1430
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:48,293
There's a train east
tonight, Campeau. Be on it.

1431
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:52,867
You're seen out here again,
you'll be shot on sight.

1432
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,306
Now, dust!

1433
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,669
Come on, Jeff, get into the shindy.

1434
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:01,772
Haven't time. I'm going to a wedding.

1435
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,552
(Leach) All right, boys, put them back.

1436
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,357
(man) Cut it out!

1437
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:17,023
Now you boys has got your options
of getting out in 30 seconds...

1438
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:18,998
or being buried in 30 minutes.

1439
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,694
Why, I can't ride this way.

1440
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:24,568
It's a mite on handy, but the Indians
can't sneak up on you from behind.

1441
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,798
[laughing]

1442
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,773
Hey, you can't do this to us.

1443
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:33,042
Well, come on, mule.

1444
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,105
[mule braying]

1445
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:39,210
[both laughing]

1446
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,255
[gun firing]

1447
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,018
Hang the mule. I'm leaving.

1448
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:02,172
And I plight unto thee my troth.

1449
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,704
(Dick) And I plight unto thee my troth.

1450
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,212
(Father Ryan) Allow me to wish
you every happiness, Mrs. Allen.

1451
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,342
Thank you, Father.

1452
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,215
Congratulations. Thank you, sir.

1453
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,015
##[organ playing]

1454
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,971
Dick. Why, hello, Jeff.

1455
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:36,565
Come to kiss the bride?
No, Dick. I've come for you.

1456
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:40,638
You've got guns, I haven't.
That's your hard luck.

1457
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:44,313
Have you found proof,
Butler? Yes, Campeau talked.

1458
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:47,251
'Tis a terrible thing
you're doing, Jeff.

1459
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,847
And for what? They've
got the money back.

1460
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:53,189
The soldier that was guarding it
hasn't got his life back, Mollie.

1461
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:56,391
Killing?

1462
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,734
Dick would have been safe away
but for me. I got him into this.

1463
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,502
(Casement) Come with me, Mollie. No.

1464
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,738
The railroad gives short shrift
to a train robber, Mrs. Allen.

1465
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:12,736
Come on, Dick.

1466
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,915
'Tis a brief honeymoon
you're giving the bride.

1467
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:23,081
There's no other way, Mollie.

1468
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:28,355
Can I kiss my husband goodbye?

1469
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:32,831
All right.

1470
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:40,941
[inaudible]

1471
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,812
Could you know the
heart-scald that's inside me...

1472
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,287
there's much you'd understand, but I...

1473
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:59,291
I know the railroad law and I...

1474
01:29:59,961 --> 01:30:02,156
(Mollie) The window, Dick! Run for it!

1475
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:03,958
[all shouting]

1476
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,062
(Jeff) Don't shoot. Don't
shoot into that crowd.

1477
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:08,124
(woman) What did he do?

1478
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:09,191
(man) He robbed the pay train.

1479
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,495
What's the ruckus? Dick Allen. Got away.

1480
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:14,040
Well, I declare.

1481
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:15,700
[crowd chattering]

1482
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,444
Leach, get a couple of
horses. (Casement) No, Jeff.

1483
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,312
You go on to Laramie.
They'll be needing you there.

1484
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:25,015
Leach and Fiesta will stay here
and give Allen his medicine.

1485
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,912
It might be better that way, I reckon.

1486
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:34,722
Maybe.

1487
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:44,066
When you reach Laramie,
pack your things...

1488
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,129
and turn your car over
to the superintendent.

1489
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:49,005
Your service with the
railroad is finished.

1490
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:38,253
##[scatting]

1491
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:52,263
Lot of warm winter overcoats
on the hoof out there.

1492
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,101
[whistle blowing]

1493
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:56,538
I hope the hogger don't hit one of them.

1494
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,212
[whistle blowing]

1495
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:28,607
My apologies, Mrs. Allen.

1496
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:35,246
Disgraceful hour for a
bridegroom to be coming home.

1497
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:41,113
[laughing]

1498
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:44,756
I'll wash off some of Wyoming
before I kiss you good morning.

1499
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,257
A fine wedding night.

1500
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:53,561
Under a car with a floor
between me and my wife.

1501
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:00,167
You're not gonna give me
lead for breakfast, are you?

1502
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:08,209
You shouldn't be on this
train. Jeff Butler's aboard.

1503
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,477
Jeff? Back in the caboose.

1504
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:18,286
'Tis an awful chance
you're taking, being here.

1505
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:23,926
You're here, aren't you?
I'm not sure where I am.

1506
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:28,761
[whistle blowing]

1507
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:42,273
Now, don't look so glum.

1508
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:46,787
Here I am, all washed and beautiful
and wanting a most important kiss.

1509
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,252
I loved you before, Mollie.

1510
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:59,358
But after last night... Dick,
I must tell you straight out.

1511
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:04,101
I don't feel for you what a woman
should for the man she's just married.

1512
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,500
The cards are dealt, Mollie.

1513
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:12,339
I'm the husband you
found in a teacup. I know.

1514
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:16,912
Till death do us apart, but...

1515
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:21,513
All I'm asking for is
a little time to... Time?

1516
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,551
I'm borrowing it from the devil.

1517
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:27,093
Why should I wait? You're
asking me and I'll tell you.

1518
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:29,527
Do you know why I married you so quick?

1519
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:32,192
Yes.

1520
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:37,969
To stop Brett from putting
a bullet in Jeff's back.

1521
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:39,768
You married me knowing that?

1522
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,740
I love you enough to take
you any way I can get you.

1523
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,504
Listen to me, Dick. I...

1524
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:48,241
I've loved Jeff ever since I clouted
his face on the Omaha train...

1525
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:51,480
but I'm married to you and
I'll stay that way, but...

1526
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,482
Don't start out by making me hate you.

1527
01:34:58,259 --> 01:35:00,284
You won't hate me, Mollie.

1528
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,387
You'll love me.

1529
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:08,567
Gorry. What's hit us?

1530
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:09,694
[guns firing]

1531
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:10,896
Keep down. It's a big war party.

1532
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:11,960
[bullet whizzing]

1533
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:13,665
[ululating]

1534
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,146
What are they, Jeff?

1535
01:35:25,419 --> 01:35:27,114
Sioux, and a lot of them.

1536
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:29,282
[guns firing]

1537
01:35:39,233 --> 01:35:40,928
[speaking Sioux]

1538
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:47,968
[guns firing]

1539
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:00,352
The saints forgive me for taking
human life. The red devils.

1540
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:24,034
[Sioux yelling]

1541
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:33,516

Are you all right? I
don't know. I think so.

1545
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:46,859
Now's our chance. Once we're clear
of the train they won't get us.

1546
01:37:46,927 --> 01:37:49,657
I'm going to find Mollie. It's
too late to do her any good.

1547
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:50,924
Maybe.

1548
01:37:52,733 --> 01:37:55,099
Come on, you fool, before they see us.

1549
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:57,198
I hope you make it.

happened to the caboose?

Well, I'll be...

1568
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:18,072
Hello, bucko. Me prayers were answered.

1569
01:40:18,746 --> 01:40:20,873
I guess we're the only ones alive.

1570
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:23,313
How much ammunition you
got? A few for the pistol.

1571
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:25,113
About 16 for the carbine.

1572
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:28,688
Any chance of getting help?
If we could telegraph Cheyenne.

1573

Wires cut? No.

1574

But we've got nothing to send with.

1575
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:36,788
Mr. Calvin showed me how
to send without any key.

1576
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:38,331
How? Manna from heaven.

1577
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,891
The wires across the window.
Cut one and give me your gun.

1578
01:40:47,908 --> 01:40:50,399
When I break it, pull the other
end down through the smashed roof.

Through your private entrance?

1580
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:54,810
Now where's me poker?

1585
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:33,012

there? Leach and Fiesta.

Some operator feeling his liquor, Alida.

01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:50,125
When a man's on his trick
he ought not to... Wait.

1593

It's near an hour and I'm thinking
our message didn't get through.

1601
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:36,882
Sure it got through.

1602
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:39,748

Jeff.

1611
01:43:44,751 --> 01:43:46,742
They're working down this way.

What do you think?

1613
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:50,786
We'll try again, Mollie.

1614
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:52,525

Let them have it, Dick.

Something like old times, huh?

1625
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:56,888
Yeah, only you didn't have a wife
with you then. Make a barricade.

Faster, faster!

Jeff's on that train.

Why do you keep me loading when
there's shooting to be done?

1637
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:19,404
Because you wasted a shot on
that cigar store Indian out there.

1638
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:23,336
Yeah, what did you have against him?

1639

You're just joking to
keep me spirits up...

1640
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:28,938
because you know Cheyenne
never got our message.

No.

01:51:47,267 --> 01:51:48,495
I'll get her to the army doctor.

1722
01:51:48,568 --> 01:51:50,001
No, you can't, with that arm.

1723
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,903
I'll carry her. No, you won't.

1724
01:51:53,606 --> 01:51:56,598
Get up to Skull Rocks. I'll
bring you word there tonight.

1725
01:51:56,676 --> 01:51:58,803
No, I'm not going to leave her.

1726
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:01,176
She's mine. She's my wife.

1727
01:52:02,482 --> 01:52:06,384
When Leach and the soldiers come
back here, you'll be a dead man.

1728
01:52:07,821 --> 01:52:09,880
You're still wanted, Dick.

1729
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:18,292
[crying] Mollie, my darling.

1730
01:52:23,903 --> 01:52:25,894
[coyote howling]

1731
01:52:27,307 --> 01:52:28,865
[crickets chirping]

1732
01:52:38,184 --> 01:52:40,345
Hello, bucko. Hello, Dick.

1733
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:41,746
How is she?

1734
01:52:41,821 --> 01:52:44,688
Doctor says she'll
come through all right.

1735
01:52:45,692 --> 01:52:47,853
My thanks to the Big Dealer.

1736
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:51,528
I'm afraid it's going to be
a long pull for her, though.

1737
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,567
And you won't let me see her?

1738
01:52:55,335 --> 01:52:56,597
Dick...

1739
01:52:58,004 --> 01:53:00,871
you and I have fought
side by side many times.

1740
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:02,703
We've been through
hell and high water...

1741
01:53:02,776 --> 01:53:06,177
robbed the same chicken
coop, chewed on the same bone.

1742
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:09,813
But you're on the other
side in this fight...

1743
01:53:10,183 --> 01:53:14,483
and the next time I see you on Union
Pacific property, I'll have to...

1744
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:17,183
You got a match?

1745
01:53:18,358 --> 01:53:21,293
Won't your conscience
bother you for letting me go?

1746
01:53:21,361 --> 01:53:24,694
There's grub and blankets
in the pack on that horse.

1747
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:26,929
I won't be hung for
horse stealing, will I?

1748
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,989
[chuckles]

1749
01:53:28,268 --> 01:53:31,362
Belonged to an Indian.
He won't need it anymore.

1750
01:53:32,005 --> 01:53:33,199
All right.

1751
01:53:34,007 --> 01:53:36,066
All right. I'll get going.

1752
01:53:36,176 --> 01:53:37,507
Where to?

1753
01:53:39,612 --> 01:53:41,079
Central Pacific.

1754
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:45,644
You're going to help the
road that's trying to beat us?

1755
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:46,810
Yeah.

1756
01:53:47,153 --> 01:53:50,748
I'm gonna help them the same
way I helped the Union Pacific.

1757
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:54,326
Here. You might need that.

1758
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:58,025
Don't deal any cards off
the bottom with it. Thanks.

1759
01:53:58,298 --> 01:54:00,994
Extra cartridges in the pack. Thanks.

1760
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,431
You're all aces, bucko.

1761
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:05,937
But you're in love with Mollie...

1762
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,530
and don't you ever forget she's my wife.

1763
01:54:08,608 --> 01:54:10,803
I might. She wouldn't.

1764
01:54:18,017 --> 01:54:21,783
Now, when the Central meets the
Union's tracks, I'll be there, Jeff...

1765
01:54:22,088 --> 01:54:24,352
and you and the Union Pacific
and the devil himself...

1766
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:26,722
won't keep me from my wife.

1767
01:54:28,294 --> 01:54:30,785
I'd hate to kill you with your own gun.

1768
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:33,457
I'll be there, Dick.

1769
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:38,967
Oh, Jeff...

1770
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:42,674
you're wasting your time on Campeau.

1771
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:45,672
The man behind him is
Barrows, the banker.

1772
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:47,407
Thanks.

1773
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:50,579
So long, Dick. So long, bucko.

1774
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:22,237
[wind howling]

1775
01:55:26,419 --> 01:55:29,582
Thirty days? Thundering
Hades! We can't lose one day.

1776
01:55:29,656 --> 01:55:33,456
The ground in that tunnel is frozen
harder than rock. We can't dig through!

1777
01:55:33,526 --> 01:55:36,256
We've got to blast
every inch for 900 feet.

1778
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:37,887
Stuck here for 30 days?

1779
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:39,693
And Ogden only 60 miles away.

1780
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:41,393
And the Central on the plains...

1781
01:55:41,467 --> 01:55:44,595
with nothing to stop them
but daisies and buttercups.

1782
01:55:44,671 --> 01:55:47,367
In the Army, when we can't smash
through the enemy's center...

1783
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,101
we always go around the flanks.

1784
01:55:49,175 --> 01:55:50,972
What's that, Butler?

1785
01:55:51,044 --> 01:55:52,944
Lay a track on the snow.

1786
01:55:53,012 --> 01:55:54,138
What? On the snow?

1787
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:56,909
On the snow? No one
ever laid track on snow.

1788
01:55:56,983 --> 01:55:58,314
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1789
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:01,251
Go ahead, Butler. I'll
show you what I mean.

1790
01:56:02,522 --> 01:56:05,252
Go around the mountain
instead of through it.

1791
01:56:05,325 --> 01:56:07,657
Then finish your tunnel
later. Impossible.

1792
01:56:07,727 --> 01:56:08,887
Impossible?

1793
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:11,226
It was impossible to lay
four miles of track a day...

1794
01:56:11,297 --> 01:56:13,128
impossible to clear out the gamblers...

1795
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:15,326
impossible to make
engines climb mountains.

1796
01:56:15,401 --> 01:56:18,199
Jumping Beelzebub! It was impossible
for Moses to cross the Red Sea.

1797
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:20,330
Why can't we lay track on top of snow?

1798
01:56:20,406 --> 01:56:22,203
Well, let's find out.

1799
01:56:22,575 --> 01:56:24,440
[all muttering]

1800
01:56:25,545 --> 01:56:26,842
You never seen the like.

1801
01:56:26,913 --> 01:56:29,541
A track laid on 10 feet of snow.

1802
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,712
We have the race as good as won.

1803
01:56:31,784 --> 01:56:32,808
[chuckling]

1804
01:56:32,885 --> 01:56:34,910
Come here before you hang yourself.

1805
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,353
That Jeff Butler...

1806
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:38,686
don't wear all his
brains in his holster.

1807
01:56:38,758 --> 01:56:40,749
Who's going to take
the first train over?

1808
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:44,285
Now, who else would they be trusting
to it but me and old McPherson.

1809
01:56:44,364 --> 01:56:46,457
It is a chancy thing, so
don't go breaking your neck.

1810
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:49,501
Well, 'tis the first time for
an engine to run on snow...

1811
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:52,333
and if he don't like it,
I'll put snowshoes on him.

1812
01:56:52,405 --> 01:56:55,738
Here, open your mouth and
take what's good for you.

1813
01:57:00,947 --> 01:57:03,677
Tastes like it come out
of McPherson's boiler.

1814
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:06,719
The highest and longest
railroad in the whole world...

1815
01:57:06,786 --> 01:57:09,186
had just come out of McPherson's boiler.

1816
01:57:09,255 --> 01:57:11,553
So don't you be insulting him.

1817
01:57:11,858 --> 01:57:13,086
Here...

1818
01:57:13,893 --> 01:57:16,225
take this along in case you...

1819
01:57:19,332 --> 01:57:21,766
Let me kiss you to keep you warm.

1820
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:44,084
Looks like you won't need to put
those snowshoes on him, Monahan.

1821
01:57:44,157 --> 01:57:46,591
Well, he's been through fire and snow...

1822
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:49,389
and if he comes to a
river, he'll swim it.

1823
01:57:49,495 --> 01:57:50,484
[laughing]

1824
01:57:57,537 --> 01:58:00,370
They're going to make it. Sure they are.

1825
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:12,681
Jump, Monahan! Jump!

1826
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:15,220
There she goes! Look out, Monahan!

1827
01:58:35,374 --> 01:58:37,035
They're both gone!

1828
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,805
(Casement) Poor old Monahan.

1829
01:58:39,245 --> 01:58:40,576
[gasping]

1830
01:58:46,252 --> 01:58:47,241
[panting]

1831
01:58:47,854 --> 01:58:49,947
I know you're hurting me...

1832
01:58:50,089 --> 01:58:51,989
no more than you can help.

1833
01:58:52,058 --> 01:58:53,184
Monahan!

1834
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:03,559
Monahan! Praise Heaven, you're alive.

1835
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:05,828
I fell clear. We'll get you out.

1836
01:59:05,905 --> 01:59:07,429
It's no use, Jeff.

1837
01:59:07,507 --> 01:59:10,408
Me and him has come to End of Track.

1838
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:11,838
Oh, no.

1839
01:59:19,452 --> 01:59:21,818
Now. Oh, no, it's no use.

1840
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:26,354
You'll have to beat the Central...

1841
01:59:26,425 --> 01:59:28,791
to Ogden without us...

1842
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:31,094
if you can.

1843
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:33,525
That'll be hard without you.

1844
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:35,157
Mollie's cross.

1845
01:59:42,241 --> 01:59:44,971
Bury us both together, Jeff.

1846
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:49,508
Here where we can hear
the trains thundering by.

1847
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:55,951
There's nothing like
hearing an engine whistle...

1848
01:59:56,889 --> 01:59:58,789
in the still night.

1849
02:00:17,343 --> 02:00:19,243
What's to be done now?

1850
02:00:21,647 --> 02:00:24,115
Start shoring up that track, Dusky.

1851
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:42,459
And what will happen
to the railroad now?

1852
02:00:43,603 --> 02:00:46,265
As soon as the track's
shored up, we'll try again...

1853
02:00:46,339 --> 02:00:48,136
with another train.

1854
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:53,274
Hook this car on it, will you?

1855
02:01:12,298 --> 02:01:16,632
There's only one thing wrong
about dying in the snow, Jefferson.

1856
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:19,261
A fella's liable to catch cold!

1857
02:01:19,338 --> 02:01:21,431
Here she comes! Tighten up!

1858
02:01:26,545 --> 02:01:29,810
Good boy, Jeff! The
Central can't beat us now.

1859
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:39,151
He's over! They've made it!

1860
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:41,352
[all cheering] I told
you they could do it!

1861
02:01:46,465 --> 02:01:48,933
You passed the 1000 Mile
Tree back there, General.

1862
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,263
We're gonna beat them, Jeff.

1863
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,634
We lay six miles of track
today, seven tomorrow...

1864
02:01:52,705 --> 02:01:54,900
Then wire your congratulations
to the Central Pacific.

1865
02:01:54,974 --> 02:01:55,963
Why? What's wrong?

1866
02:01:56,042 --> 02:01:58,909
That parlor engineer that Asa M. Barrows
brought with him just condemned...

1867
02:01:58,978 --> 02:02:00,240
27 miles of our track.

1868
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:02,042
What? Condemned 27 miles?

1869
02:02:02,114 --> 02:02:04,082
Why, that'll let the Central
into Ogden ahead of us.

1870
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:05,640
Barrows, huh?

1871
02:02:07,086 --> 02:02:08,178
Boy...

1872
02:02:08,754 --> 02:02:11,723
Get me Leach Overmile
and Fiesta. Yes, sir.

1873
02:02:12,525 --> 02:02:15,551
You lay the track into
Ogden, General Casement...

1874
02:02:15,728 --> 02:02:17,719
I'll handle Mr. Barrows.

1875
02:02:19,665 --> 02:02:21,428
You'll regret this.

1876
02:02:22,335 --> 02:02:25,168
You'll regret this as long as you...

1877
02:02:26,205 --> 02:02:28,435
Don't you worry none
about us, Mr. Barrows.

1878
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:31,271
You just think about yourself. Here.

1879
02:02:32,945 --> 02:02:34,742
This is plain abduction.

1880
02:02:34,814 --> 02:02:36,281
Do you hear that, Fiesta?

1881
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:37,373
Abduction.

1882
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:38,439
[chuckling]

1883
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:41,179
That is why I had to
marry my first wife.

1884
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:42,817
[laughing]

1885
02:02:43,155 --> 02:02:44,850
How much do you want?

1886
02:02:44,924 --> 02:02:48,724
We don't want nothing. We're just interested
in the Union Pacific, same as you are.

1887
02:02:48,794 --> 02:02:50,455
Here, put that on.

1888
02:02:51,263 --> 02:02:54,255
Now, about this track you
say won't pass inspection.

1889
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:55,459
What about it?

1890
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:59,334
You and us are going to walk over
every inch of that 27 mile of track...

1891
02:02:59,405 --> 02:03:03,068
and then you're going to show
us every place that needs fixing.

1892
02:03:03,142 --> 02:03:04,336
What?

1893
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:06,876
And then you're going to fix it.

1894
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:14,313
Walk over 27 miles of track.

1895
02:03:14,387 --> 02:03:17,447
Here's your cane, Mr.
Barrows. Time's a-wasting.

1897
02:03:26,499 --> 02:03:28,967
Here's another one, right there.

1898
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:31,229
[sighing]

1899
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:35,506
Seems to me like I've found more
the matter with this track...

1900
02:03:35,574 --> 02:03:37,166
than you have, Mr. Barrows.

1901
02:03:41,046 --> 02:03:42,809
He will ruin the railroad.

1902
02:03:42,882 --> 02:03:45,112
You're all mixed up, Mr. Barrows.

1903
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:47,812
You're trying to drive the
tie through the spike...

1904
02:03:47,887 --> 02:03:50,481
instead of the spike through the tie.

1905
02:03:53,292 --> 02:03:54,816
##[humming]

1906
02:03:55,027 --> 02:03:57,188
I do declare, he's improving.

1907
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:02,700
General Casement. Yeah?

1908
02:04:02,768 --> 02:04:05,498
At this very moment, the
Union Pacific's first train...

1909
02:04:05,571 --> 02:04:07,732
is pulling into Ogden, Utah.

1910
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:10,804
The victor in the great
race to girdle the continent.

1911
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:13,344
<i>Say, does the New York Tribune
own this telegraph line?</i>

1912
02:04:13,412 --> 02:04:15,243
<i>We're about to turn it
over to the Boston Post.</i>

1913
02:04:15,314 --> 02:04:16,440
Gentlemen...

1914
02:04:16,515 --> 02:04:19,143
President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point, west of Ogden...

1915
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:22,051
as the place where the two Pacific
railroads shall meet and join their rails.

1916
02:04:22,121 --> 02:04:24,055
Promontory Point? Where is that?

1917
02:04:24,123 --> 02:04:27,456
And so President Grant has chosen
Promontory Point as the meeting place...

1918
02:04:27,526 --> 02:04:29,118
[all chattering] for the two railroads.

1919
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:30,787
<i>The actual meeting place...</i>

1920
02:04:45,411 --> 02:04:47,038
[knocking on door]

1921
02:04:47,847 --> 02:04:49,007
Jeff.

1922
02:04:49,348 --> 02:04:51,873
I've not seen you in a month of Sundays.

1923
02:04:51,951 --> 02:04:53,578
Sit yourself down.

1924
02:04:54,887 --> 02:04:59,085
I just came over to say goodbye before
you get lost in the crowd out there.

1925
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:01,991
Everybody's coming to
see the engines meet.

1926
02:05:03,262 --> 02:05:04,559
You know...

1927
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:07,997
California sent a golden
spike to clinch the last rail.

1928
02:05:09,969 --> 02:05:11,903
But when they drive it...

1929
02:05:12,771 --> 02:05:15,239
it will mean the end of everything.

1930
02:05:16,008 --> 02:05:17,441
Not for you.

1931
02:05:18,611 --> 02:05:20,374
Dick'll be out there...

1932
02:05:20,446 --> 02:05:23,609
waiting to take you to a
home that's not on wheels.

1933
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:27,016
And no engines whistling
to put me to sleep.

1934
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:31,784
And where will your
restless boots be taking you?

1935
02:05:31,924 --> 02:05:33,084
Texas.

1936
02:05:33,759 --> 02:05:35,886
They're starting
another road down there.

1937
02:05:35,961 --> 02:05:38,521
Dodge asked me to go as an engineer.

1938
02:05:38,597 --> 02:05:41,157
It's the coming true of your dream.

1939
02:05:41,967 --> 02:05:43,525
I am glad for you.

1940
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:45,632
Sure...

1941
02:05:45,938 --> 02:05:49,203
sure there'll be some girl
to throw you sheep's eyes...

1942
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:54,440
and boil the tea when
you call for your mail.

1943
02:05:58,484 --> 02:06:00,645
Mollie. 'Tis just the excitement...

1944
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:02,949
of joining the rails and all.

1945
02:06:03,355 --> 02:06:06,324
Remember me to yourself
sometimes when you're...

1946
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:10,761
when you're riding the handcars with
some of them beautiful Texas women.

1947
02:06:15,801 --> 02:06:17,826
It's you I'll always want.

1948
02:06:17,903 --> 02:06:20,599
Some of your sweetness
got into my blood.

1949
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,870
I guess it's there for life.

1950
02:06:24,043 --> 02:06:26,568
And my heart will be answering you...

1951
02:06:27,379 --> 02:06:29,472
as long as ever it beats.

1952
02:06:36,956 --> 02:06:41,916
And now you'll be merciful if you'd take
yourself out of here as quick as you can.

1953
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:45,457
Goodbye, Mollie.

1954
02:06:55,541 --> 02:06:56,769

1959
02:07:20,199 --> 02:07:22,929
Ain't no hard feelings
on our part, Mr. Barrows.

1960
02:07:23,002 --> 02:07:26,529
I'd put you in jail but for
one thing. You like us, eh?

1961
02:07:26,605 --> 02:07:28,971
I hate the sight of you.
You've cost me millions.

1962
02:07:29,041 --> 02:07:31,339
But you've cured my indigestion.

1963

[both laughing]

1964
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:39,349
(bartender) How come you
ain't out to the big jamboree?

1965
02:07:40,486 --> 02:07:42,579
I got something else to do.

1966
02:07:45,924 --> 02:07:49,018
...and that this mighty
enterprise maybe unto us...

1967
02:07:49,094 --> 02:07:51,460
as the Atlantic of thy strength...

1968
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:54,795
and the Pacific of thy love. Amen.

1969
02:07:56,368 --> 02:07:59,599
I'll bet that all them that lies
under the sod between here and Omaha...

1970
02:07:59,672 --> 02:08:01,867
would love to see this sight.

1971
02:08:02,641 --> 02:08:05,303
They're laying golden rails in Heaven.

1972
02:08:06,412 --> 02:08:10,212
And Monahan's giving the angels
a free ride on old McPherson.

1973
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:12,209
He is that.

the greatest railroad
enterprise of the world...

02:08:26,932 --> 02:08:28,695
has just been laid.

1980
02:08:29,068 --> 02:08:30,535
And the last spike...

1981

Atlantic and the Pacific...

Never since history commenced

so magnificent in contemplation...

02:08:54,626 --> 02:08:58,221
and by whose citizens the Pacific
Railroad was inaugurated...

her sister states...

is about to be consummated.

1997

From her mines of gold...

1998
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:13,377
she has forged a spike.

she has hewn a tie.

2001

And by the hands of her citizens...

2002
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:22,609
she offers them to become a
part of the great highway...

2003
02:09:22,955 --> 02:09:26,118
which is about to unite
her in closer fellowship...

2004
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:28,523
with her sisters of the Atlantic.

2005
02:09:28,594 --> 02:09:31,495
From her bosom was taken the first soil.

2006
02:09:31,764 --> 02:09:35,825
Let hers be the last
tie and the last spike.

2007

May God confirm the
unity of our country...

2008
02:09:41,473 --> 02:09:45,876

two great oceans of the world.
