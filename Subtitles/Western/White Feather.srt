Some of the other tribes have
already started to move out.

Well, I'll be glad
to see the end of it.

514

for Broken Hand.

That Cheyenne knifed him.

Where is she?

I did not tell you of
American Horse because...

552

what was in his heart
was not in mine.

553
01:01:28,525 --> 01:01:30,925
The word of my father was given,
but not my word.

554
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:34,430

He came here. He tried to kill me.

in the stockade.
