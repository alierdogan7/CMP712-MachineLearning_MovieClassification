1
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,780
Yeah

2
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,080
When did you turn recluse?

3
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,640
You and the Jew settled in?

4
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,790
The Jew's

5
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,800
a born

6
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,460
fuckin' householder

7
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,610
Scouts furniture in the fucking catalogues mornin' and night

8
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,020
The Mrs. Ellsworth's

9
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,290
a 10-day miracle

10
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:12,150
Up and about and up and fucking doing

11
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:15,271
Meets with fucking Hearst today, her and fucking Ellsworth,

12
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,794
that I'd have thought would have steered her fucking clear

13
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:18,839
Hearst's invite?

14
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:20,602
Lady's bright idea

15
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,731
I've pretext enough if you'd

16
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,802
have me call to dissuade her

17
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:30,610
Don't you get in the fucking middle

18
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:35,390
Jesus fucking Christ, Al

19
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,280
She might as well set herself afire

20
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:45,023
I can't imagine that cocksucker got to you

21
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,640
Or you're folding your fucking tent

22
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,673
The last shot ain't yet fired

23
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:50,843
Stage is coming

24
00:02:57,355 --> 00:02:58,563
My God, look at Wu

25
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:01,400
Lost his mind in San Francisco

26
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,171
You think he married the nigger?

27
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,830
I'm talking about his suit

28
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:08,471
Mr. Blazanov!

29
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,070
Merrick!

30
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:30,282
Oh God

31
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:33,973
I am barely speaking to you

32
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:35,820
Who the fuck is that?

33
00:03:37,607 --> 00:03:40,520
A shabby, shabby exit from Virginia City

34
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,410
No "Farewell, Jack."

35
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:44,221
No "By your leave."

36
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:45,373
Nothing

37
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,473
Did you notice I was being pursued?

38
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:49,170
Is that us over there?

39
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,550
That is we, my dear, yes

40
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,200
I will install us momentarily

41
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:56,961
Countess

42
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:57,951
I stay 

43
00:03:58,296 --> 00:03:59,713
till the costumes come down

44
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:00,692
Admirable

45
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:03,001
Only the most minimal of civilities

46
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:04,173
"Hello, how are you?"

47
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,011
"A bit warmer today than Tuesday."

48
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:09,061
last may be too forgiving

49
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,011
Aunt Lou!

50
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:14,360
Hey

51
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:18,510
Good to see you

52
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:21,931
Hearst's meals are about to improve

53
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:24,972
Come on in

54
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:25,573
Okay

55
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:33,240
Go away

56
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:34,722
Stay close to the Jew

57
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,681
If it's Ellsworth apprising you of the widow,

58
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,893
let him fucking continue and do likewise for me

59
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:42,393
That's more fucking like it

60
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:49,841
Very considerate of you

61
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,361
to come to me when I thought I was coming to you

62
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,833
As I was feeling well, I thought you'd agree the

63
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,111
exercise might be beneficial

64
00:04:58,885 --> 00:05:01,003
Does your examination confirm my suspicions

65
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:03,653
as to how I'm feeling?

66
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:05,083
It does

67
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:06,461
You seem

68
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,330
fully recovered

69
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,430
I'm delighted to be recovered

70
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,381
And to find my own judgments reliable

71
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:16,022
I would, however,

72
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:19,862
advise against rushing back into things

73
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:23,133
Would any meeting between us be complete, Doctor,

74
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:26,141
until I'd had your counsel against something?

75
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,432
Have you finished taking

76
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,561
the medicine I gave you?

77
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,152
Implying what, Dr. Cochran?

78
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,391
I'm implying nothing, Mrs. Ellsworth

79
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,161
I'm putting a question to you

80
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:40,142
I disposed of the medicine you gave me, Dr. Cochran,

81
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,301
knowing I had a weakness for it,

82
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:44,092
without having finished taking it

83
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:44,880
I see

84
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,321
You seem incapable of

85
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:49,101
crediting me as a full and

86
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:51,542
normal person

87
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:53,873
I credit you as exactly that, Madam,

88
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:57,021
which is to say as having limits like the rest of us,

89
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,390
and  to urge upon you the humility

90
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:01,432
of not asking more of yourself

91
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:02,931
than is reasonable

92
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:04,962
And I'd add my observation

93
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:07,141
that refusal to make such adjustment

94
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:11,342
sometimes is symptom in women of an inadequate recovery from the rigors

95
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:12,500
you've just endured

96
00:06:14,538 --> 00:06:15,961
You say this as my physician?

97
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:17,021
Yes

98
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,292
Not my reprover

99
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:19,510
or rebuker?

100
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:20,310
No

101
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:23,791
Then thank you,

102
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:24,820
Doctor,

103
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:26,900
and good morning

104
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:34,692
You ain't getting' no cobbler, Mr. Hearst,

105
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,681
till I get my hands on them boots

106
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:38,590
Uh, here they come.

107
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:39,463
Here they come

108
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:43,511
Not one spoonful till I got 'em clean

109
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:46,320
Filthy

110
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,462
It's frontier living out here, Aunt Lou

111
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:49,660
Where I go, 

112
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:50,961
ain't no frontier

113
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:53,212
I bring some standards with me

114
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,091
Ah…

115
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,821
I miss Missouri yet, Aunt Lou

116
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:01,763
Wasn't the world peak of ripe back then?

117
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,100
Didn't even the birds seem

118
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:04,120
to sing different?

119
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:05,651
More like they meant it

120
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:06,622
More like they meant it

121
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:07,422
You  understand

122
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,013
I don't suppose you operate another pair in secret

123
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,010
You know I wouldn't fib

124
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,071
Then I'll brush 'em up directly

125
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,580
I got you living right here in the building, Aunt Lou

126
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:21,202
I wouldn't even think about any other arrangements

127
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,351
Mightly generous, Mr. Hearst

128
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:26,902
Mighty brave

129
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:27,692
Will you take a walk, 

130
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:28,783
see the camp?

131
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:31,113
I'll take a walk as far as my kitchen

132
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:33,843
I should have known you'd say that

133
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:35,733
You want that peach cobbler, don't you?

134
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:36,662
I do for a fact

135
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,302
And they know downstairs who's boss

136
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,530
Is this here a rich place, Mr. Hearst?

137
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,432
Oh,

138
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,480
very, very rich, Aunt Lou

139
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:47,250
For pure scale,

140
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:50,122
maybe the richest find I've seen

141
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:53,751
Guess we can live without them birds then

142
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:03,380
The high points

143
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:05,380
of the fucking high points of your trip, Wu

144
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:09,141
Cause I won't be able to follow you anyway

145
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,664
Wu

146
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,249
San Francisco

147
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:15,161
You look like a fucking idiot,

148
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:18,302
if no one has yet conveyed to you the truth

149
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,091
Wu,

150
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:20,442
San Francisco,

151
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:21,861
Hearst

152
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:22,931
Yeah, you

153
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,411
in San Francisco,

154
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,073
collecting workers for Hearst

155
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:27,090
Ho

156
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,242
How soon, fucking Wu?

157
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:32,030
The many Chinks

158
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,480
in Hearst's employ?

159
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:34,332
Huh?

160
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:41,590
"Hello, hello, hello, hello!"

161
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,270
The many chinks here, huh?

162
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,221
How soon?

163
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,190
Ah!

164
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:49,560
10 Day

165
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:51,650
"10-Day, Wu."

166
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:54,523
Clever cocksucker

167
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:55,822
You come back with more fucking English

168
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:57,521
Ho

169
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,341
Now once I get my ducks in order,

170
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:01,673
you

171
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,402
will give your information

172
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:04,213
to Hearst

173
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:05,340
in a sit-down,

174
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,522
so we can gauge

175
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:09,501
his attitude toward me

176
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:11,003
Wu,

177
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:12,372
Hearst,

178
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:13,512
"Swedgin."

179
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,361
And "Swedgin" must act as translator,

180
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:17,900
as he is the only one in camp

181
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:19,932
versed in both languages

182
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:21,471
Ho

183
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:25,673
Chung Kuo

184
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:28,183
Am I right or am I fucking wrong?

185
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:29,821
Chung-Kuo

186
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:31,270
Chung-Kuo, Heng-Dai

187
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:33,591
Heng-Dai

188
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:34,843
Heng-Dai, Chung Kuo

189
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,390
And I'll tell you when the meeting is, huh?

190
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,320
Welcome home, Wu

191
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:46,890
Mmm

192
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:51,921
It's arrogance,

193
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:53,860
nothing more to Goddamn less

194
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,242
Do not use profanity, please,

195
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:57,601
speaking to me

196
00:09:58,448 --> 00:09:59,541
For  goodness sake

197
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,492
Apologizing for my language,

198
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:03,433
I ask you consider my meaning

199
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,852
It hardly seems arrogant to me to seek an equitable

200
00:10:08,227 --> 00:10:10,810
and mutually beneficial resolution with Mr. Hearst

201
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,482
Then spare him that paper with your pretty ideas

202
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,792
Tell him your price for how much you'll sell,

203
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,051
because Hearst don't let his partners set policy

204
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,301
I  hadn't realized you were so intimate with his business methods

205
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,102
Please don't be smart with me

206
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:25,041
Not about this

207
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:25,612
"This,"

208
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:26,850
Mr. Ellsworth,

209
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:28,880
being the question of my mine?

210
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:30,742
Well, what in the hell else would it be?!

211
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:32,713
Excuse me

212
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,580
I will meet with Mr. Hearst

213
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:36,203
I'll be delighted

214
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:38,412
if you should choose to accompany me

215
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:40,442
Oh, I ain't one to miss a train wreck

216
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:45,153
Though if you cannot forbear from patronizing me,

217
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,023
I'd prefer you didn't come at all

218
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:51,123
All right, Mrs. Ellsworth,

219
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:52,841
all right

220
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:53,993
Empty

221
00:10:58,118 --> 00:10:59,550
You sure you don't want me to work behind here, boss?

222
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:00,890
If I wanted you working behind here,

223
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:02,141
you'd be fucking working behind here

224
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:03,261
Fucking work over there

225
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,582
It occurs to me, Al,

226
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:07,823
as you and he are 

227
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,763
so evidently well-acquainted,

228
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,723
the decent interval that

229
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:14,433
Mr. Langrishe is owed to make his domestic arrangements

230
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,823
I might spend hearing you talk of him

231
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,470
Ever wonder if you expressed yourself more directly, Merrick,

232
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:20,801
you might fucking weigh less?

233
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,332
I see no logic in that whatever

234
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:24,813
I don't want to talk of Langrishe

235
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,262
He makes me fucking nervous

236
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:27,131
On what account?

237
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:29,252
I can't say on what account

238
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:29,822
That type,

239
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,233
he type you don't know exactly how you feel about him 

240
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,750
is who you're made nervous by

241
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:36,552
Young man!

242
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:39,280
Keeping the wolf away, I see

243
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:41,563
Jack

244
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:44,852
John Langrishe, sir

245
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,663
The operator has the manners of a pig

246
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,842
A. W. Merrick, Mr. Langrishe,

247
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:50,582
publisher of "The Deadwood Pioneer."

248
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:51,362
Ah!

249
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,412
Accounted for the halo I see above you

250
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,390
Shit blizzard's early today

251
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,973
He takes his tone with you as a familiar

252
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,361
Oh, we're well-acquainted, Mr. Swearengen and I

253
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,352
Mmm, new friends,

254
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:03,602
old campaigners

255
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,100
The infrequent bloody win

256
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:06,993
Always superfluous, bloodshed

257
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:09,520
The deeper damage is best

258
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:12,371
Ahh!

259
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,201
Candidly, Richardson,

260
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:30,272
as I imagine you foraging for berries and grubs,

261
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:32,553
and  flicking at insects with your sticky tongue,

262
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,223
I feel a certain dismay

263
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:37,082
What are you talking about?

264
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:38,673
You are to be discharged, fool

265
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:40,362
As, I suspect

266
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:41,971
in a wink of time,

267
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,413
once some stage from a different direction arrives 

268
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,181
with my replacement, am I

269
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:47,782
What did we do wrong?

270
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:48,320
Your error, 

271
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,140
surprisingly enough,

272
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:51,893
is not to be a grotesque

273
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,193
of inconceivable stupidity,

274
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,513
but that you are white and male

275
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:59,011
and not repulsively obese

276
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:00,762
As for my own,

277
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:05,581
I wonder if it lies in an excessive courtesy

278
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,553
and eagerness to please

279
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:10,750
Shoo, skunk. Shoo

280
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:12,073
Go, go

281
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:14,730
Mr. Hearst

282
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:17,141
Farnum, have you a moment for us to talk?

283
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:17,773
I do

284
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:20,120
I'd ask only that you be brief

285
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,371
and forbear from

286
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,243
false camaraderie

287
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:27,932
Come, Hearst

288
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:29,790
I've seen the Ethiop

289
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:30,780
Who indeed could miss her?

290
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,522
And even as she supplants Richardson,

291
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:35,203
what person, I wonder,

292
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:39,012
of what depraved exotic origin have you engaged

293
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:40,613
to take my place?

294
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,800
I hadn't thought of replacing you

295
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:45,562
Do you want me to?

296
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:51,442
The world begins to dance before my eyes

297
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:52,511
As for Richardson,

298
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:54,870
Aunt Lou will be taking his position,

299
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:58,211
but he can keep doing whatever else it is that he does

300
00:13:58,575 --> 00:13:59,862
with no reduction in wage

301
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,820
What a surprising and gratifying turn

302
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:04,453
Paid through Tuesday

303
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:06,081
That one's paid through Thursday

304
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:11,263
Having secured your approval as to my hiring plans,

305
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:12,182
I wonder now 

306
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,983
if I might elicit the information I came for,

307
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:17,180
which is in regard to Mrs. Ellsworth

308
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:20,211
I am abjectly at your disposal

309
00:14:23,765 --> 00:14:24,652
For some time,

310
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:29,280
without the unseemliness of approaching her directly,

311
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:31,571
I have sought without success

312
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,343
to generate a connection with Mrs. Ellsworth

313
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:35,470
A haughty cunt

314
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,892
Formerly weak for dope

315
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:39,940
Most fundamentally a sexual peccant,

316
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,461
though I'm sworn against providing specifics

317
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,100
Now, 

318
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:48,463
as it seems of her own volition,

319
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:51,983
Mrs. Ellsworth appoints to meet with me,

320
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:56,721
leading me to wonder what change in her situation prompts her approach

321
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:58,143
I will look into that, Sir,

322
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,480
vigorously and immediately

323
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,273
You don't know

324
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:01,572
I do not know at present

325
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,550
Just send her up when she gets here

326
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:04,883
I can seek the knowledge out

327
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:06,440
I can pursue it as a first priority

328
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:07,753
Just send her the fuck up

329
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:08,363
All right, Sir

330
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:09,453
And may I say…

331
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:12,762
how delighted I am our relation is to continue?

332
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:28,871
Why don't you see to your type?

333
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:29,660
Excuse me?

334
00:15:29,786 --> 00:15:30,272
Type

335
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,070
Don't you use type to print out your words?

336
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,222
Uh, well,I'd hoped to secure from Mr. Langrishe

337
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:37,581
I want copious discourse between us, Mr. Merrick

338
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,302
Where shall I find you soon?

339
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:40,393
Well,  we could speak now if you wish

340
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:41,953
No, not now, young man

341
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:43,192
Not immediately

342
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:44,772
But soon

343
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:46,411
Very, very soon

344
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:47,683
Where is your lair, 

345
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:49,593
that I may beard you?

346
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,641
My lair adjoins the Gem

347
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:53,273
Wonderful

348
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:54,581
I can be bearded there most hours

349
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:55,471
Fine

350
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:57,731
Thank you Thank you very much

351
00:15:58,006 --> 00:15:59,400
Thank, uh, very nice to meet you, Sir

352
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:01,633
Ah, the camp is lucky to have you

353
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,722
Uh, no way, actually,

354
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:04,242
you would know that

355
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,572
Go on there, Merrick Get away

356
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:07,750
Oh, incessant and unrelenting,

357
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,821
exactly that type of banter

358
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:11,331
I'll just go out the front

359
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:13,090
You know, I could go out that way

360
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,072
but I

361
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:14,802
I'll

362
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:19,690
You're looking fucking well, Jack

363
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,242
It's the learning fucking nothing, Al,

364
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,261
that keeps me young

365
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:27,832
Please

366
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:30,323
I hope you'll forgive the disarray

367
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,613
I seem to feel a greater priority

368
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,801
about making space for myself than

369
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,643
adorning the space I've made

370
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,060
Refreshments?

371
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:40,402
No

372
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:42,842
I must say

373
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:46,453
I feel less the grown man just now

374
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,851
than a boy from Missouri

375
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:52,082
My Aunt Lou Marchbanks

376
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:53,360
has come to camp

377
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:55,580
Is your Aunt's visit a surprise?

378
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:56,020
No.

379
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,662
Heavens no, no.   I

380
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,490
expecting my stay to be brief,

381
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,500
I left her at other diggings

382
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:05,812
Your Aunt Lou prospects, too?

383
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:07,562
My Aunt's my nigger cook

384
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:08,510
I see

385
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:09,832
Wonderful, wonderful cook

386
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:11,551
And a tyrant, of course,

387
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,143
as the best ones always are

388
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,000
I quite quake before her

389
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:16,451
Do you?

390
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,482
About our conversation too,

391
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:21,420
wanting so awfully much we come to an agreement

392
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:22,641
Don't disappoint him,

393
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:25,311
being as he's 12 with his Aunt in camp

394
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:27,240
I've learned that we 

395
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:28,941
shared time in the Comstock,

396
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,072
Mr. Ellsworth. I'm sorry we didn't meet

397
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:32,302
Whatever's toward what he wants

398
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:35,620
Not a flying fuck if it's true or how fucking soaked in blood

399
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,752
That talk serves no purpose

400
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:39,971
What talk to a murderer does?

401
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:42,553
I'd not be insulted in my own rooms, Mr. Ellsworth

402
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:44,963
Where shall we go for me to do it?

403
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:48,231
Will you be in this afternoon, Mr. Hearst?

404
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:50,221
There's bodies in here

405
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:51,072
I certainly can be

406
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:54,020
The walls are down to make room for 'em. I see every fucking one!

407
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,663
Perhaps we could speak later then

408
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,430
I will look forward to that

409
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:02,442
You don't look forward to nothing far as her,

410
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:04,103
you murdering cocksucker

411
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:05,141
You hear me?

412
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,062
I'm very glad to have met you

413
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:27,123
I recognize 

414
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,780
perhaps as I never fully recognized before,

415
00:18:30,348 --> 00:18:32,172
how profoundly you feel about him

416
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,093
I know him

417
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:35,633
I will present 

418
00:18:36,937 --> 00:18:37,901
my offer to him

419
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:38,663
You will not

420
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:40,070
I will not permit it

421
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:40,793
You 

422
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:42,761
behave in his rooms 

423
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,870
as virtually a maniac

424
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:47,572
and now assert your superior prerogative?

425
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:48,790
I forbid you, yes

426
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,641
Well, I suppose that settles it

427
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,073
I know him

428
00:19:09,436 --> 00:19:11,360
May I ask you to collect Sofia

429
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:13,513
once you've seen me home?

430
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:15,113
Do you understand?

431
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,072
In ways you can't

432
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:18,221
Mr. Ellsworth, 

433
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,752
you hardly need explain yourself to me,

434
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:22,080
your wife, 

435
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:23,900
in the thoroughfare,

436
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:26,383
having once laid down the law

437
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:36,713
Hey

438
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:37,742
Look at me!

439
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:39,951
Talk to me

440
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:46,180
He said they come up in cage

441
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:47,873
The guard was behind Jory

442
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:51,800
The guard wait for air change

443
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:54,671
First breath from above, he push Jory to the wall,

444
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,350
catch his legs and cut them off.

445
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:58,511
He saw it?

446
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:00,961
Jory was organizing

447
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:03,290
That's why they push him to the wall

448
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:07,870
We're awful sorry

449
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,242
Get the fuck away from him!

450
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,063
Get out of here go ahead

451
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:11,942
Get on

452
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:16,803
Accident

453
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,140
Another friend, he says,

454
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:30,623
was shot 10 days ago in bar

455
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:32,602
At the Gem

456
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:34,370
The friend talked union too

457
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,552
Jory and him were in the bar when he was shot Now they're dead

458
00:20:38,096 --> 00:20:39,271
Pasco says he'll be next

459
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:56,890
Tell them they can go

460
00:20:57,545 --> 00:20:58,911
when they're done crying

461
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:01,093
Make them understand 

462
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,570
I was only talking to him

463
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,023
Hole in the building's front wall

464
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:12,602
He can pop out at any moment

465
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:13,643
Hearst

466
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:17,241
I'd not have him see us together

467
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,251
Prudent

468
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,251
Ah,

469
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,393
bacon

470
00:21:24,996 --> 00:21:27,391
Might have a bit of a human aftertaste

471
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:31,593
Lurid with Chinese

472
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:33,182
No one suggests a theater here

473
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,240
Only observing, turning you outward

474
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:38,563
Deen a ma na ha mo goh ya!

475
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,622
Eh, chon choy!

476
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:41,773
Whi nee fie!

477
00:21:42,197 --> 00:21:42,922
Fie ne jowa!

478
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,722
Jow!

479
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,473
Boss of the neighborhood

480
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:48,152
Won a war to take over

481
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:54,840
One hopes you are his backer and not his tailor

482
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:00,203
You're the first I've fucking revealed this to

483
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:02,062
Fucking throbs all the way up

484
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:05,533
Goes with me to the grave

485
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:08,420
Yeah

486
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,481
You fucking tip your hat to everybody?

487
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:15,503
Everybody

488
00:22:19,535 --> 00:22:19,823
Morning

489
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:24,420
We're low on our hardware, just doing the order

490
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:29,320
Dogs

491
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:32,023
For him to laugh at 

492
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,822
while we chase our tails

493
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:38,350
I'm gonna write it up anyway

494
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:40,861
Hearst's phony fucking accident,

495
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm gonna present it to him

496
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:45,042
and put him on notice

497
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:52,910
I'm 

498
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:56,780
concerned about Mrs. Ellsworth, Trixie

499
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,940
If concerned means 

500
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:00,842
"Is she using?"…

501
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,653
I don't think she is

502
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:09,731
I don't either

503
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,343
Then why'd you ask if she was?

504
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:12,141
I didn't

505
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:13,221
You just 

506
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:15,210
took me for asking that

507
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,073
Ask the one you want to then

508
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:20,792
I'm concerned that her 

509
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:21,973
temperament is

510
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:24,243
is labile

511
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,372
I guess that means she's talking through her cunt?

512
00:23:33,027 --> 00:23:36,402
Her moods seem inappropriately variable

513
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,362
Saying "variable,"

514
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:41,791
I don't disagree

515
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:45,902
I said so myself this morning to somebody else

516
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:52,782
Did I fucking embarrass you, Doc,

517
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,522
hat you go so fucking red?

518
00:23:57,828 --> 00:23:58,761
Don't throw a fit, Doc

519
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:00,883
Look, I'll put it out

520
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:20,572
This is new

521
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:25,402
This entire area

522
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:27,450
is recent

523
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,413
The Ellsworth house, the richest claim 

524
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:32,163
next to Hearst, that woman

525
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,611
What sort of plays 

526
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:34,652
does she favor?

527
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:36,470
Oh, Christ, she told me 

528
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:37,432
and I fucking forgot

529
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:41,070
Goes through her men like Sherman to the fucking sea

530
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:44,393
This

531
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:49,061
can't remember who this fucking belongs to

532
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:53,780
And who does this fucking belong to?

533
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:56,530
Well, I guess this belongs to 

534
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:57,583
fucking everybody

535
00:25:02,806 --> 00:25:03,741
The Bullock house

536
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,123
Fucking Sheriff

537
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,872
Insane fucking person

538
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:16,173
The one at Swearengen's, too,

539
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:17,552
I'll put him on notice about

540
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:24,500
I'm gonna put him on notice about it all

541
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:32,742
Wouldn't be looking for anyone coming through the wall to deal with your Johnson

542
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:34,802
And don't you try fucking coming to my side either,

543
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,763
or your Jew head will be wearing that fucking dresser as a tiara

544
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:39,521
All right

545
00:25:39,878 --> 00:25:40,970
We're supposed to read your mind,

546
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:43,313
understand what you fucking mean

547
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:44,410
I mean…

548
00:25:47,438 --> 00:25:47,831
all right

549
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:49,290
Shut the fuck up

550
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:53,511
"Please don't smoke" means "I'm at death's fucking door."

551
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:56,683
You can smoke

552
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:01,261
I'd prefer…

553
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:04,110
if 

554
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:05,622
you did it outside

555
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:12,121
You're a fucking idiot, anyways

556
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:20,570
Pus is a deeper yellow

557
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:22,700
Aw, cocksucker

558
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:25,583
What are you staring at? Fucking boot fits, huh?

559
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:30,372
Home base, young man

560
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:33,433
There's the whole fucking area on the other side

561
00:26:33,797 --> 00:26:34,770
I'm quite worn out

562
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:37,202
I fucking started this job,

563
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:38,253
I'll fucking finish it

564
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:40,640
This motherfucker

565
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:42,142
Al…

566
00:26:44,237 --> 00:26:46,763
It's not the first impression I'd make

567
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:53,763
Heartfelt thanks

568
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:14,172
With such disagreement among the statements, Mr. Bullock,

569
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:18,013
on what basis could an inquiry justifiably go forward?

570
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:19,911
I put you on notice, Mr. Hearst

571
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:21,963
I identify a pattern in these events

572
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:27,443
Unless some law is broken, Mr. Bullock,

573
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:29,720
whose sanctions you have power to apply,

574
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:32,133
why in fuck should I care

575
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:34,982
what pattern you identify or don't?

576
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:36,872
There is a sanction against murder

577
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,640
The man lost his legs in a shaft

578
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:40,003
It happens quite often

579
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,382
I now learn that your worker who died in the Gem last week

580
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,772
was killed by two of your guards

581
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,012
I defy you to prove that event,

582
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:49,392
about which the two of us have spoken,

583
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:50,311
was murder

584
00:27:50,718 --> 00:27:53,912
Whereas, in the same saloon nine days ago,

585
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,853
two guards of mine, giving no provocation,

586
00:27:57,335 --> 00:27:58,281
had their throats cut

587
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:01,703
with two others of my guards as witness

588
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:03,862
Certainly,the guards who survive 

589
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:06,113
are capable of naming the killers

590
00:28:06,996 --> 00:28:08,811
Shall I have them make complaint?

591
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:16,323
I put you on notice

592
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:30,170
Many new people are in the camp, Mr. Merrick

593
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,200
And a very eventful time we had during your absence, Mr. Blazanov

594
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:38,062
You and I will have much to discuss in our evening perambulations

595
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:42,943
Okay

596
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:44,431
Main line coil,

597
00:28:44,948 --> 00:28:46,680
artificial line coil,…

598
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:47,182
new 

599
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:49,341
armature lever,

600
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:50,483
separate battery,

601
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:51,562
supplementaries

602
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:52,882
All new contrivances 

603
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,103
I was instructed about in Chicago

604
00:28:55,725 --> 00:28:57,743
Without this many innovations,

605
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:00,503
differential duplex would no be possible

606
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:02,753
Differential duplex?

607
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:05,063
Can you speak in

608
00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:06,453
a high voice, 

609
00:29:06,796 --> 00:29:07,470
Mr. Merrick?

610
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,381
I can speak in a low voice

611
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:14,250
Blazanov then will speak in high voice

612
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:19,263
Keep speaking on in your low voice while Blazanov

613
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:21,720
at the same time, speaks highly

614
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:25,781
Blazanov : This is duplex telegraphy
Merrick : From this point on, I shall speak in my low voice

615
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:31,832
Blazanov : Both messages sent at the same time…from the same office at different voltages
Merrick : Excuse me, but I can't understand you when we both talk at once

616
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:39,061
And recorded elsewhere by instruments with appropriate sensitivities

617
00:29:42,168 --> 00:29:43,301
Well, I

618
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,422
I won't keep you from your work

619
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,252
Mr. Merrick?

620
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:53,192
I met a girl in Chicago

621
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,161
Oh, 

622
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:56,213
yes?

623
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,673
Also for our…

624
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:00,772
perambulations

625
00:30:02,005 --> 00:30:02,342
Hmm

626
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:06,521
Yeah

627
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:10,593
Seeing you on your balcony the other night, Mr. Tolliver,

628
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,100
taking in the life of the camp,

629
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:13,742
I thought maybe it was time we had a talk

630
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:17,202
I regret we have to meet in this environment, Sir

631
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:18,212
Not at all

632
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:19,032
No

633
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:21,630
Changes that have gone on here,

634
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:23,802
it's not the place I'd be seen in by you

635
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:26,390
I'm sure whatever changes you allude to, Mr. Tolliver,

636
00:30:26,696 --> 00:30:28,162
will come clear from your behavior

637
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:28,940
Fresh start

638
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:31,930
How many men

639
00:30:33,036 --> 00:30:34,833
would be grateful for that opportunity?

640
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:36,263
Do you have more you wish to do with that,

641
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:37,662
or shall I state my business?

642
00:30:37,787 --> 00:30:38,642
Please, 

643
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:40,181
state your business

644
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:42,261
Your letter from Mr. Wolcott

645
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:45,023
naming me as having knowledge of his misdeeds

646
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:48,243
A letter I mentioned to you, yes,

647
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,461
in a conversation I regret

648
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:53,731
5% of my holdings I recall as your demand,

649
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:55,830
or you would circulate the letter's contents

650
00:30:55,956 --> 00:31:00,323
Exactly what I regret and now find reprehensible and why I thank God

651
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,481
that you take a new look at me

652
00:31:02,848 --> 00:31:03,872
To this point, Mr. Tolliver,

653
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:06,322
you make no materially different impression

654
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:07,002
Still lying,

655
00:31:07,307 --> 00:31:08,063
still bullshitting

656
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:09,910
I hope I'm not, Sir, but I

657
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:13,801
I can certainly understand why that would be

658
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:15,441
your material second impression

659
00:31:15,698 --> 00:31:19,292
Shall I show you the letter from Mr. Wolcott that I have in my possession?

660
00:31:19,698 --> 00:31:21,300
That's not necessary from my point of view

661
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,021
You tell me you've got it,

662
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:24,330
I believe you

663
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:25,611
Here it is

664
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:27,253
Will you compare it to your letter?

665
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:28,892
Verify its authenticity?

666
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:30,411
It's not necessary

667
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:31,833
Shall I read to you certain 

668
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,610
pertinent sections on

669
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,013
Wolcott's assay of your nature

670
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,331
and likely behavior after his death?

671
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:43,130
is detailing your complicitous participation in the aftermath of his crimes

672
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,743
disposing of the bodies and so forth?

673
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:49,430
You have no letter from Wolcott, Mr. Tolliver

674
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:55,900
Let's say that's the case

675
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:57,373
I just did Let's hear you say it

676
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:01,500
I have no letter from Mr. Wolcott

677
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:02,293
Never did

678
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:03,522
I never did have one

679
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,543
You're a lying, blackmailing sack of shit

680
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:08,852
What do you want?

681
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,033
I want you to go to work for me

682
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,400
How was your walk?

683
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:23,341
I seemed to get around adequately

684
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:25,552
Seemed to get along with that dandy

685
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,510
Yeah, he's all right

686
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:30,851
Theater fella, huh?

687
00:32:31,525 --> 00:32:32,423
Langrishe?

688
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:37,681
He's a fucking promoter of the first fucking quality,

689
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:38,690
I can tell you that

690
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:39,453
I don't go to plays 

691
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:41,011
so I can't speak to his worth 

692
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,010
as an actor

693
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:45,103
Ahh

694
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:46,141
Tuesdays…

695
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:48,511
he'll tend to have amateur nights

696
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,101
Been to plenty of those

697
00:32:50,975 --> 00:32:51,642
Virginia City

698
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:54,242
Guy farted seemed near an hour

699
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:57,673
Well, that don't sound like no amateur

700
00:33:00,698 --> 00:33:01,362
Bullock

701
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,991
Tell that Chinaman when I want admission to his meat locker,

702
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,111
it behooves him 

703
00:33:05,456 --> 00:33:06,520
to fucking cooperate

704
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:07,820
What did he do instead?

705
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:08,832
Said "Swedgin"! 

706
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:10,291
 and barred my way

707
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,480
Had you eyes to select your own cut?

708
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:13,793
Are you gonna fuck with me?

709
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:17,411
I had eyes for the Cornishman killed in here last week

710
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:18,353
I explained it to him, 

711
00:33:18,658 --> 00:33:20,152
and he Goddamn understood me

712
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:23,061
Did he mosey over to a corner,

713
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:24,432
 lift up a fucking tarp?

714
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:27,750
Yeah, he went to the tarp

715
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:29,421
That's what the croaker was under

716
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:32,611
That's our nook in Wu's structure

717
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:37,401
Why Wu delayed cooperating,

718
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,642
he hadn't known the croaker was under there

719
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,343
His stupid suit so overcome me,

720
00:33:44,476 --> 00:33:45,812
it slipped my mind to tell him

721
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:48,581
I want that body

722
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:51,172
I'll see Wu hands it over

723
00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:58,602
Hearst just had another Cornish killed at his diggings for trying to organize

724
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,793
They're calling that one an accident

725
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:02,242
What makes you think 

726
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:05,172
any good will come of confronting Hearst now?

727
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:07,302
Now is when he's killing people

728
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:08,703
What, you feel he'll leave off soon?

729
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:10,981
Tactics and timing ain't the issue

730
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,182
The hell you say

731
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:19,162
If his pigs get that body,

732
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:21,660
Wu is their next fucking meal

733
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:23,503
You make him understand

734
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:01,562
"Chez Ami"

735
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,113
"Cooperage"

736
00:35:05,577 --> 00:35:07,313
I'm watering these kids' vegetables

737
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:08,840
We don't do the other anymore

738
00:35:09,966 --> 00:35:10,562
Very good

739
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:14,760
Lovely building

740
00:35:15,715 --> 00:35:16,382
Sturdy?

741
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:17,582
Get away now

742
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:30,940
I apologize

743
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:32,483
for the awkwardness

744
00:35:33,017 --> 00:35:34,913
between you and my husband

745
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:35,800
My dear Phoebe,

746
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,512
Mrs. Hearst, like your Mr. Ellsworth,

747
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:41,690
while pleasantly conversable on most subjects,

748
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:44,881
find others not to suit her at all

749
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:57,131
Will you hear my offer, Mr. Hearst?

750
00:35:57,878 --> 00:35:58,862
Of course

751
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:05,543
I am willing to sell to you 

752
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:08,030
a 49% ownership in my claim,

753
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:09,163
in return for

754
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:10,852
and here…

755
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:13,093
of course, I am out of my depth

756
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:13,980
but 

757
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:16,522
for the sake of beginning a negotiation,

758
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:17,061
I'll say 

759
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:18,853
5% of your holdings in the hills

760
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,821
You would have an easement through my holdings for the

761
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:24,402
transport of your ore,

762
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:28,582
unqualified in any regard except that it not impede my mining operation

763
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:29,572
Naturally,

764
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:30,851
at a separate fee,

765
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:33,572
I would wish access to transport for my own 

766
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:35,381
ore

767
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:37,380
Have you finished?

768
00:36:39,507 --> 00:36:40,840
I have, yes

769
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:42,810
Your proposal is 

770
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:44,291
thoughtful,

771
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:46,360
but I'm afraid I lack

772
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,591
the qualities that

773
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:51,080
minority participations require

774
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:53,433
As I said, these are the most 

775
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,151
preliminary thoughts

776
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:58,430
A vulgar man would ask before preceding any further

777
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:01,112
if you would require him to produce his jackknife 

778
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,413
and make himself a capon before you

779
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:09,491
What in my ideas

780
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:11,412
do you find emasculating?

781
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:15,012
I can offer no inside explanations, Mrs. Ellsworth,

782
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,501
as I am not a capon,

783
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:19,581
which details offend me and why

784
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:22,342
your proposal offends completely

785
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:25,811
It mistakes my nature absolutely

786
00:37:31,756 --> 00:37:32,370
All right

787
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:34,321
Will you hear my counterproposal?

788
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:35,692
I think not, Sir

789
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:37,612
Do hear it, Mrs. Ellsworth

790
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:39,841
Let me name an amount to buy you out

791
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:42,971
I will not hear it, Mr. Hearst

792
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:45,543
Let me out

793
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:48,471
Shall I scream?

794
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:52,342
The hour makes the thoroughfare uncertain

795
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:57,853
Will you have an escort until your dear home's lights appear before you?

796
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:00,353
No

797
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,803
You are reckless, madam

798
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:11,363
You indulge yourself

799
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:36,620
Stand your watch. I'll

800
00:38:36,788 --> 00:38:37,423
I'll get this part later

801
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:26,300
Everything fixed to your liking, folks?

802
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:27,542
Wonderful

803
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:28,473
Thank you

804
00:39:29,118 --> 00:39:30,041
Have you supped sumptuously?

805
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,223
Actually, we have

806
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:32,141
I'm delighted

807
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:32,932
Countess?

808
00:39:33,306 --> 00:39:33,990
Costumes were damp

809
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:34,981
Oh dear

810
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:36,343
Are you drying them?

811
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,130
You are, of course

812
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:40,492
I am tedious beyond bearing to ask

813
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:42,183
A newly rakish tilt

814
00:39:44,268 --> 00:39:47,080
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph Company

815
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:48,663
Telegram for Mr…

816
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:51,042
"Langinshire."

817
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:52,600
Langrishe!

818
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:53,411
Langrishe

819
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:54,533
I am he

820
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:56,133
Telegram

821
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:56,882
Yes

822
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:05,442
Wait

823
00:40:11,898 --> 00:40:12,451
Thank you

824
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:13,613
Very welcome

825
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:19,771
What did you give?

826
00:40:20,196 --> 00:40:20,473
A dollar

827
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:21,452
Too much

828
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:23,431
Chesterton and Bellegae 

829
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,632
are in transit from Cheyenne

830
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:28,273
Having "suffered the tortures of the damned"?

831
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,310
"Endured indescribable 

832
00:40:30,385 --> 00:40:30,991
inconvenience."

833
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:33,343
"The damned" was from Fort Kearney

834
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:36,500
I shall take the air

835
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,460
Shall I accompany you?

836
00:40:40,017 --> 00:40:41,711
My destination is beneath you

837
00:40:41,995 --> 00:40:43,051
At least something would be

838
00:40:44,135 --> 00:40:44,611
Good evening

839
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:46,701
Good evening

840
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:48,791
Madam

841
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:49,943
Sir

842
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:53,031
Wonderful food!

843
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:58,673
We got fish and we got ham,

844
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,242
and don't pay no attention to the menu

845
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:10,413
The thought

846
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:12,210
I'd put into it,

847
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:15,130
all the time I took to write it out

848
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:16,900
and put it by and look again

849
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:21,602
I began to read to him my proposal,

850
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:23,772
but I I was more and more afraid

851
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:24,372
I was only 

852
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:25,952
chanting sounds

853
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:30,032
Finally, I made myself look to him

854
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:34,103
to confirm that I was speaking intelligently and being understood

855
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:35,112
Now you know

856
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:38,811
He grinned at me

857
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:40,303
like a jackal

858
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:44,861
This is what I would have spared you

859
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,453
He scorned my offer

860
00:41:47,397 --> 00:41:47,983
He said I 

861
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:50,600
mistook his nature

862
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:51,930
absolutely

863
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:52,540
You did

864
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:53,341
Yes

865
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,882
And was there more?

866
00:41:58,337 --> 00:41:59,993
After the jackal smiled?

867
00:42:00,777 --> 00:42:01,403
It seemed

868
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:03,891
very possible that there could be,

869
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:05,351
but finally he let me go

870
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:06,613
He had restrained you?

871
00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:11,142
I was very afraid

872
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,340
I can't say with any certainty exactly what was happening

873
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,653
What the hell do you mean?

874
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:19,181
Did you try to leave,

875
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:20,913
and did he prevent you?

876
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:23,973
Don't use that tone of voice with me

877
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:28,020
Well, I guess I know what that means

878
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:30,041
Oh, do you, Mr. Ellsworth?

879
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:33,471
That you're a Goddamn fool who almost go what she deserved

880
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,631
And what would that have been?

881
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:39,212
And why would I have deserved it?

882
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:47,662
I only wanted to protect you

883
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:49,491
You 

884
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,272
can't

885
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,230
I wish you'd eat that outside, Mr. Hearst

886
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,651
I wanted to be sure you have all you need

887
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,580
And more besides

888
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:09,612
And now you done seen for yourself

889
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:12,532
I really don't care what others think of me, Aunt Lou

890
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:14,551
And you need only care what I think

891
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:17,140
God, I hate these camps

892
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,251
All this deferring and adjusting to other's

893
00:43:20,008 --> 00:43:21,263
wrong-headed stupidities

894
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:24,542
I must have missed where they way better in San Francisco

895
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:24,790
They're not

896
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:25,593
They're worse

897
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,480
Can't bear San Francisco

898
00:43:28,746 --> 00:43:30,460
Don't let Mrs. Hearst hear you saying that

899
00:43:30,788 --> 00:43:31,811
Aw, she knows, she knows

900
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,500
She knows why I always leave so quickly

901
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:41,283
Goddamn truth is I'd rather be off by myself, Aunt Lou

902
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:42,970
Free to do my work

903
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:46,673
"Boy-the-Earth-Talks-To."

904
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:48,262
That's your Indian name

905
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,401
That's right, You remember

906
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:53,311
Only Goddamn conversation I care to have

907
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:56,310
Her telling me where to dig into her

908
00:44:04,315 --> 00:44:04,801
Wonderful

909
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:06,703
Thank you, Sir

910
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:18,841
Haven't ate potatoes quite that smooth

911
00:44:20,555 --> 00:44:22,580
I don't know if I ever had 'em that smooth

912
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:28,023
These elections can't be a joke

913
00:44:30,555 --> 00:44:33,030
More tail-chasing for him to laugh at us about

914
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:34,680
Hearst

915
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:36,572
The offices have to count for something

916
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,440
How will you work that?

917
00:44:47,355 --> 00:44:47,951
Laws

918
00:44:48,637 --> 00:44:49,463
Jesus Christ!

919
00:44:50,556 --> 00:44:51,261
Excuse me

920
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:54,311
Seems like one way more for his kind to run us

921
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:57,560
Laws do

922
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,401
Who will have strawberries?

923
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:14,610
I hope you'll take it as measure of my keenness, Sir,

924
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,070
and curiosity

925
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:18,040
Yes, yes, yes, Mr. Tolliver

926
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,690
You wish to know your duties in my service

927
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:23,663
Well, I make my way through the muck to learn the details

928
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:28,642
Your duties will be to answer like a dog when I call

929
00:45:29,578 --> 00:45:30,433
Like a dog?

930
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:34,633
Complications of intention on your part in dealings with me

931
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:35,692
or duplicity 

932
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:37,552
or indirection

933
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,922
behavior, in short, which displeases me,

934
00:45:40,646 --> 00:45:42,711
will bring you a smack on the snout

935
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:44,593
Ouch

936
00:45:44,848 --> 00:45:48,223
When administered by a practiced hand such a blow can be

937
00:45:48,948 --> 00:45:49,581
more painful

938
00:45:50,006 --> 00:45:51,951
and grievous even than your

939
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:54,103
recent sufferings

940
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:57,821
I don't doubt the hand would be practiced

941
00:45:58,137 --> 00:46:00,541
Mr. Swearengen recently discovered as much

942
00:46:01,937 --> 00:46:02,402
I gather

943
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:04,973
it cost him a finger

944
00:46:07,436 --> 00:46:09,632
But I should say too that

945
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:12,891
in these rooms just this afternoon

946
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:15,552
such displeasure brought me near to murdering the Sheriff

947
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,061
and raping Mrs. Ellsworth

948
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:22,610
I have learned through time, Mr. Tolliver, and

949
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:25,563
as repeatedly seem to forget

950
00:46:26,978 --> 00:46:28,543
that whatever temporary comfort

951
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,911
relieving my displeasure brings me, my long-term

952
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,641
interests suffer

953
00:46:35,636 --> 00:46:37,602
My proper traffic is with the earth

954
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:40,063
In my dealings with

955
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:42,473
people,

956
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:45,002
I ought solely have to do with niggers

957
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:47,941
and whites who obey me like dogs

958
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:53,461
If he hadn't meant me to wag it, Sir,

959
00:46:53,748 --> 00:46:55,970
why would the Lord give me a tail?

960
00:47:00,505 --> 00:47:00,922
So

961
00:47:01,396 --> 00:47:03,221
I make you my second deputy,

962
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:07,393
you clever little heathen monkey tongue

963
00:47:11,476 --> 00:47:12,900
You stand there, Richardson

964
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:15,130
You're lucky for Aunt Lou

965
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:19,340
Don't shy away from a little noise now

966
00:47:20,115 --> 00:47:21,313
Ah chung ow chi

967
00:47:22,085 --> 00:47:23,280
See I speak your stuff

968
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:24,723
You savvy?

969
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:26,532
Clatter them Goddamn sparrows

970
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:31,103
"I love your cobbler like sunset, Lou."

971
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:33,393
And back-broke niggers in the fields

972
00:47:34,808 --> 00:47:35,421
George Hearst…

973
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:37,712
do love his nose in a hole more,

974
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:39,291
and ass in the air,

975
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:42,002
and back legs kickin' out little lumps of gold

976
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:43,510
like a fucking badger

977
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:45,653
No more use for them nuggets, either

978
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,032
Past counting them up,

979
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:49,832
and saying that big number to astonish niggers

980
00:47:50,217 --> 00:47:51,923
to remind us we in the world

981
00:47:54,808 --> 00:47:55,370
Hah!

982
00:47:56,517 --> 00:47:57,791
I seem to have won

983
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:00,550
That's the 13 orphans natural

984
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:04,651
Shall we clatter them motherfuckers again?

985
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:12,582
Strange affectations your devil friend has

986
00:48:12,465 --> 00:48:13,402
Shabby appearance,

987
00:48:13,828 --> 00:48:14,832
derelict hotel

988
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:18,200
Put the hole through that wall just before he worked on my hand

989
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:20,012
Americans…

990
00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:23,121
it never occurs to them to try the window

991
00:48:25,717 --> 00:48:26,780
I'll tell you the truth

992
00:48:29,508 --> 00:48:31,921
I begin to wonder if I mightn't be fucking queer

993
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:35,861
You see more to admire in the male asshole than you'd…

994
00:48:36,578 --> 00:48:37,901
realized hitherto?

995
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:40,241
That I haven't gone yet for Hearst's throat

996
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:42,011
Ambition

997
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,193
and the blessed simplicities of action

998
00:48:44,748 --> 00:48:46,503
don't always quarter in comfort

999
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:48,923
I've no fucking ambition past trading

1000
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:50,881
to my favor 

1001
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:52,262
and coming…

1002
00:48:52,988 --> 00:48:53,690
once a day

1003
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:55,591
Bullshit!

1004
00:48:56,845 --> 00:48:58,423
A thing of this order

1005
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:00,863
you'd as soon not see ruined

1006
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:02,863
or in cinders

1007
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:06,392
I will if I fucking have to

1008
00:49:07,716 --> 00:49:08,960
Avoiding it

1009
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:11,033
if I could

1010
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:18,612
Good night, Al

1011
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:20,702
Good night

1012
00:49:23,146 --> 00:49:23,643
Few enough

1013
00:49:24,558 --> 00:49:25,982
I find tolerable

1014
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:29,882
Lucky our paths have crossed again

1015
00:49:32,607 --> 00:49:34,133
Don't misinterpret that

1016
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,110
All right, Jack
