<i>NARRATOR:
Into the West came many men.</i>

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,457
Some were good men
and some were bad men.

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,866
<i>Some were good men
with some bad in them.</i>

4
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,929
<i>And some were bad men
with some good in them.</i>

5
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:32,601
<i>This is the story
of two pretty good bad men.</i>

6
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,311
<i>Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry.</i>

7
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:41,185
<i>Together, these gentlemen
substantially altered</i>

8
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,721
<i>the course
of America's frontier.</i>

9
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,625
<i>They did a lot to change
railroad schedules, too.</i>

10
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,128
<i>And in all the trains
and banks they robbed,</i>

11
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,357
<i>they never shot anyone.</i>

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,765
<i>This made our two Iatter-day
Robin Hoods very popular</i>

13
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,303
<i>with everyone but the
railroads and banks.</i>

14
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,507
<i>Because unlike Robin Hood,</i>

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:08,343
<i>Hannibal Heyes and Kid Curry robbed from the
rich and kept the money for themselves.</i>

16
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:12,479
<i>It was a good life,
but times were changing.</i>

17
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:17,285
<i>Safes were getting better, the
posses were getting bigger,</i>

18
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:20,318
<i>sheriffs were getting smarter,</i>

19
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,252
<i>and modern communications
made it only a matter of time</i>

20
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,861
<i>until they would be captured
and maybe even killed.</i>

21
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,137
Stand and deliver!

22
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,608
Who says so?
Kid Curry.

23
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,307
Hannibal Heyes.

24
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,955
AII right. Everybody out!
Move it, pronto!

25
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,424
Let's go, move it!

26
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,567
How're you boys coming
with that safe?

27
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,573
She's gonna blow
sky-high!

28
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,475
Take the dirt, folks!

29
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,240
Look out!

30
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,984
Pull her down, boys.

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,022
I'm Birdie Pickett.
I'm so...

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,917
How much dynamite
did you use, Kyle?

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,791
Every last stick of it.

34
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,296
For one little old safe?

35
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,662
This ain't no
little old safe.

36
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,559
This is a Brooker 202.

37
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,453
What's the delay?

38
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,518
Well, I'm sure
I don't know, ma'am.

39
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,389
Better go check
your fuse, Kyle.

40
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,123
I ain't going in there!

41
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,228
Listen, when the leader ofthe
gang tells him to do something,

42
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,738
don't he have to do it?

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,868
Yeah, that's my understanding.

44
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,504
But what makes you
such a great leader, Heyes,

45
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,946
is that you never tell
no man to do a thing

46
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,074
you wouldn't do yourself.

47
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,414
You wanna be leader?

48
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,953
After you.

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,896
Kyle got it wet.

50
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,565
Well, whose fault is that?

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,509
I warned you not to ford
that river, didn't I? Huh?

52
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:02,638
Oh, no.
No, you and your short cuts.

53
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,340
Don't get
proddy, Wheat.

54
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:09,187
Hey! Folks are getting restless.
They're starting to mutter.

55
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,846
Mutter what?

56
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,119
Oh, like, maybe you two
don't know what you're doing.

57
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,248
(SCOFFS)

58
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,591
Like if you can't even
blow up the safe,

59
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,995
maybe you ought to get in
some other line of work.

60
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,662
That kind of talk
could ruin us.

61
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,568
Well, I happen to agree with him.
Wheat...

62
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,200
Wasn't no offense meant, Kid.

63
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,766
None taken, Wheat.

64
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,905
Now, I wanna remind you boys that
we don't exactly have a Iot oftime,

65
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,643
so if you would just Iet Heyes here
have a few quiet minutes to work...

66
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,618
Oh, sure, sure.
Come on, Kyle.

67
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,090
(COUGHS)

68
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,225
I suppose
you boys are wondering

69
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:57,166
what a little old lady from Boston is
doing way out here in the Wild West.

70
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,171
Ma'am, I wonder if you could
kind of keep your voice down.

71
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,001
My partner
has to hear the tumbler.

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,073
Tumblers? Oh, I know. But if
you don't mind an opinion,

73
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,047
I don't think that you
and your friend are cut out

74
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,312
for this sort ofthing.

75
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,217
Well, now,
wait a minute, ma'am.

76
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,778
Now, this ain't been
our best day.

77
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,619
MRS. PICKETT: I'm sure.

78
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,628
But I do thinkthat
you ought to read this.

79
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,322
What's this?
Some kind of religious tract?

80
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,894
Well, it may be the answer to
all of your problems, my dear.

81
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,532
Now, you just take it and read
it when you find the time.

82
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,405
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

83
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,638
And now you had
better get back to work

84
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,737
because I see
your friends are frowning.

85
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,477
Uh...

86
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,683
It's no use.

87
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,620
This safe ain't human. lt'Il take
me two hours to get into it.

88
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,213
AII right, then,
let's make tracks.

89
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,156
This train's due
into Columbine right now.

90
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,820
Posse will be leaving out of
Columbine 10 minutes from now.

91
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,487
Lot oftruth in there.

92
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:03,134
Yeah, but there's $50,000
in this safe.

93
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,827
We ain't leaving it behind.

94
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,461
What are you suggesting
we do with it?

95
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,597
HEYES:
We're taking it with us!

96
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,677
When I said,
"Let's make tracks,"

97
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,812
that ain't exactly
what I had in mind.

98
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,017
That posse's gonna be real
grateful to Heyes, ain't they?

99
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,821
How'd you do it, Wheat?

100
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,759
Smarter.
But how?

101
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,458
That's for me to know
and you to find out

102
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,228
when I'm the leader
ofthis gang.

103
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,747
WHEAT: Heyes, why are we heading
up towards the mountains?

104
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,223
HEYES: So we can drop
the safe off a big one.

105
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,126
(ALL GRUNTING)

106
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,172
Ifthat don't bust her
wide open, nothing will.

107
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,075
Yeah, I hope you're right,
Heyes,

108
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,875
'cause, the way I figure it, we got
the short end of an hour left.

109
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,422
HEYES:
Gotta be here someplace.

110
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:36,560
Keep looking, fellas. I mean, you
know it's gotta be here. I mean...

111
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,656
We'll find it. Don't worry.

112
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,558
I mean, we pushed her from up there.
She's gotta be down here, right?

113
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,406
The way I figure it, Heyes,

114
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,343
you owe me and the boys
about $50,000.

115
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,514
Now, we ain't got
no time for talking, Wheat,

116
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,174
we only got
time for looking.

117
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,150
Understand?

118
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,153
Yahoo! Here she is, boys!
Here she is!

119
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,624
What? Is she open?

120
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,820
No, she's buried.

121
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,415
"Sure-fire, boys.
Can't miss, boys.

122
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,477
"Ifthis don't work,
nothing will, boys."

123
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,545
(SCOFFS)

124
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:42,024
Now, Wheat, you said you had
an idea better than Heyes'.

125
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,187
I figure me and the boys
are ready to back you up.

126
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,752
Yeah, right.
Yeah.

127
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,125
AII right, men.

128
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,065
Well, the first step
is to

129
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,474
dig up that safe.

130
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,101
Good idea!
Right!

131
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,645
Dig up the safe!

132
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,009
(EXCLAIMING)

133
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,580
Well, don't let it
eat at you, Heyes.

134
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,346
Maybe he don't have
no second step.

135
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,653
(ALL GRUNTING)

136
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,523
Get over there.

137
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,622
Wheat, may I remind you that
we ain't got too much time.

138
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,756
We already pushed
this 202 off a mountain,

139
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,232
and it didn't so much
as scratch her paint.

140
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,326
Heyes, listen, it's all in
the way you handle things.

141
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,134
Now, you dropped her into the mud.
I'm fixing to aim her on the rocks.

142
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:06,405
Mean, hard, pointed rocks. She'll
come apart Iike a two-bit barrel.

143
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,104
Wheat, may I point out...
We're ready, Wheat.

144
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,377
Just... I'm running
things now, all right?

145
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,342
AII right, boys,
let her go.

146
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,714
Well, could've been
a lot worse.

147
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,475
How?

148
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,052
Could've been my idea.

149
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,517
Sure making it easy.

150
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,818
Yup.

151
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,197
Maybe it's a trap.

152
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,033
You know, Iwasjust
thinking the same thing.

153
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,072
We better proceed
more cautious from here on.

154
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,704
They're awful smart.

155
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,900
No telling what that bunch
is up to.

156
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,666
Well, I guess that does it.

157
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,304
You two ain't just walking
away from all that money!

158
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,548
No, we're walking away from a posse.
Advise you to do the same.

159
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,677
I don't take advice,
I give it!

160
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,314
And I'm advising you two
to reconsider.

161
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,757
You walk away, we ain't gonna be obliged
to owe you no share in that money.

162
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,919
Well, that seems
fair enough, Wheat.

163
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,692
See you boys later. Wish you
all the Iuck in the world.

164
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,694
Be seeing you again,

165
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,733
if you don't
hang around here too long.

166
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,178
Let her go.

167
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,813
Heyes, what's amnesty?

168
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,611
Huh?

169
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,322
Where'd you get this?

170
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,159
Little old lady from Boston.

171
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,699
Said it could be the end
to all our troubles.

172
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,299
What's amnesty mean?

173
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,298
Well...

174
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,639
Well, what it means is there's more
chicken thieves, land grabbers,

175
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,203
and rag-picking penny stealers
around than there is Iawmen.

176
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,943
So if a man wants
to turn himself in,

177
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,212
governor might see fit
to wipe his slate clean.

178
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,185
"Might" see fit?

179
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,222
Depends on who you are
and what you done.

180
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,382
Oh.

181
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,758
Well, I don't suppose
we'd have a chance.

182
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,153
You don't suppose right.

183
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:17,795
Hey, good Iuck now!
You better hurry, boys!

CURRY: There's one thing
we gotta get, Heyes.

188
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,926
HEYES: What's that?

189
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,557
CURRY: Out ofthis business!

190

(GUNS FIRING)

191
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,465

(CLEARS THROAT)

195
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,508
What can I do for you?

196
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,648
Howdy, Lom.

197
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,758
Heyes.

198
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,557
Oh, Lom, no. Is that any way to
say hello after all these years?

199
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,624
Hello, you're under arrest,
and where's the Kid?

200
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,142
Ought to get a lock
for that side door, Lom.

201
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,518
Nice to see you, Lom.

202
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,451
Well, it ain't nice
to see you.

203
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,354
I'm gonna tell you straight
right now, both of you.

204
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,586
If you have a mind to pull
something here in my town,

205
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,357
you'd best be primed to walk
over my body doing it.

206
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,122
Lom, we're friends.

207
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,599
Were friends.

208
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,033
Oh, now, Lom.

209
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:09,267
We never held it against you. Sporting
a big tin star, big as a hog's head.

210
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,472
Coffee, Lom?
No, thanks.

211
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,806
Yeah, ru...

212
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,746
Well, you know, Lom, we still
think of you as one of us.

213
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,949
Well, what do you want?

214
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,028
What do you know
about this?

215
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,166
Amnesty?

216
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,839
That's a program the governor's
trying out to see if...

217
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,835
(CHUCKLES)

218
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,978
You ain't thinking of amnesty
for you two?

219
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:54,211
Oh, that's for cheap crooks
and small-time grifters.

220
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,415
Oh, well.

221
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,649
Can we help it if we're a
bit better at what we do?

222
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:03,285
You can't tell me the governor's
gonna penalize us for excellence.

223
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,056
And one thing's for sure.

224
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,324
Whoever does our talking is
gonna have to believe in us.

225
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,960
Does your... Does your talking?
You don't mean me?

226
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,833
Well, hey, Lom.

227
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,875
The only man we know who can look
the guv straight in the eye,

228
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,605
tell him an outlaw
can turn good, and mean it.

you be careful.

May I speak with you,
Sheriff?

234
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,957
Oh, hello, Miss Porter.

235
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,229
Isn't it kind of Iate for you
to be out by yourself?

236
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,272
Oh, I was working Iate.
I'm on my way home now, but...

237
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,774
Oh, I didn't realize that you were
right in the middle of something.

238
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,402
I ain't in the middle of nothing.
These are just a couple of...

239
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,879
Old, old friends.

240
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,938
Well, any friends
ofthe Sheriff's

241
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,747
are instantly put on my list
of preferred acquaintances.

242
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,255
Aren't you going to
introduce us, Lom? Huh?

243
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,013
Oh, sure.

244
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:12,886
May I present,
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones.

245
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,254
This is Miss Porter
of Porterville.

246
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,131
Charmed, I'm sure.
Delighted, ma'am.

247
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,693
Mr. Smith. Mr. Jones.

248
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,100
Actually, Lom, what I came
to talk to you about was

249
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,302
we're handling a very large payroll
at the bank tomorrow and...

250
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,911
Oh, perhaps I should explain,
I'm running the local bank.

251
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,884
And I was thinking we ought to talk about
some additional security measures.

252
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,747
I'm sure we should.

253
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,423
You are the local banker,
ma'am?

254
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,153
In my father's absence, yes.

255
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,889
Well, I'II drop by the bank the first
thing in the morning, Miss Porter,

256
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,363
and look into your
security arrangements.

257
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,162
Oh, that would be fine, Lom.

258
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,795
Although I'm fairly confident
with our big new Brooker safe.

259
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,429
Brooker?
Brooker, ma'am?

260
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,132
HEYES: Not the Brooker 202?

261
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,870
No. The Brooker 404.

262
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,440
Oh...

263
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,275
Brooker 404.
404.

264
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,145
Well, you just
rest assured, ma'am.

265
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,414
There ain't a man in these
parts can open a Brooker 202,

266
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,148
let alone a 404.

267
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,916
Now, how is that, Mr. Smith, that
you know so much about safes?

268
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,921
Well, it's kind of in his
line of work, Miss Porter.

269
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,224
But the Brooker 404
is brand new!

270
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,197
I didn't know anybody knew
anything about them.

271
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,665
It is new to these parts,

272
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:28,069
but they've had one for some months
at the Mercantile Bank of St. Louis,

273
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,136
and the Farmer's Bank
at Fort Worth, too.

274
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,677
Mr. Smith, you've given
your secret away.

275
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,242
I have?

276
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,412
You are in banking!

277
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,343
Yes.

278
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,387
Yes, you could say that,
couldn't you?

279
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,989
Mr. Smith, given your choice,
would you pick a Brooker safe

280
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,753
or a Magnalock?

281
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,359
I'd pick either one.

282
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,992
Actually, I'm more
in the money end of it.

283
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,892
My partner, Mr. Jones, here,
is the security expert.

284
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:03,771
An expert? Right here in Porterville?
Well, ma'am...

285
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:07,709
Oh, Lom, now, you know how I've been
trying to prove myself while Daddy's away.

286
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,805
It's just that,
being only a woman, I...

287
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,948
I feel I need guidance.

288
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:19,616
Lom, do you think that we might
prevail upon your friends

289
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,022
to take an interest
in our little bank?

290
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,618
Well, I'm sure they'd do
just that, ma'am,

291
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,587
if they were to stay in town.

292
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,765
As it happens, they'll be
leaving real sudden Iike.

293
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,564
However, Lom, since
she is a friend of yours...

294
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,799
And since we do have some unfinished
business with you, Lom...

295
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,671
Then you will take a look
at our security systems?

296
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,574
Oh, with pleasure, ma'am.

297
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,442
First thing in the morning,
ma'am.

298
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,983
I know I'II be in good hands.

299
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,415
Good night.

300
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,953

304
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,131
So that's it.

305
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,463
AII this talk about amnesty
is just an excuse

306
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,593
for you to be here
while you set up the bank.

307
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,568
Lom, if you know one thing about me and
the Kid, you know our word is good!

308
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,870
We never come anywhere
near this town before

309
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,378
'cause we didn't want to cause
any trouble for you.

310
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:20,410
AII right, if you can't help
us now, okay, I understand.

311
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,280
You make our excuses to the lady, tell
her we had to leave town unexpected.

312
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,879
Let's go, Kid.

313
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,858
Wait, boys.

(SIGHS)

315
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,966
I guess I knew all along that
you stayed out of Porterville

316
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,661
just to keep my record clear.

317
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,739
I suppose one good turn
deserves another.

318
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:45,271
Then you'll do it?

319
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,506
You'll talk to the governor?

320
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,780
With all the heat he's been getting
from the banks and the railroads,

321
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,978
he might even thank me for coming up with
a way to put you two out of business.

322
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,718
When can you get started?

323
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:00,052
No sense in waiting. I'II take
the 7:15 train in the morning.

324
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,090
AII right, Lom.
You're a good man.

325
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,253
Yeah, I told you.
I told you.

326
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,654
So long, Lom. Be seeing you.

327
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,491
We'll be waiting right here
for you when you get back.

full of you-know-what, huh?

329
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,866
Well, so long, Smith. So long, Jones.
AII right.

330
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,530
I expect you can stay out
oftrouble till I get back.

What could happen?

this safe before the bank opens.

00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,296
Well, I'm very grateful to you
for your efforts, both of you.

340
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,735
Our pleasure, ma'am,
and our business.

341
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,499
Oh, that's so apparent.

342
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,336
Are you satisfied,
Mr. Smith?

343
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:02,411
Yes, ma'am.
You got your money's worth.

344
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,708
Five tumbler,
sequential action.

345
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,776
But a good dynamiter
could blow it.

346
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:13,620
Well, he'd have to get through the steel
bars on our windows and our doors first.

347
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,992
Well, I wish we could continue
this discussion,

348
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,589
but if you'll excuse me,
I must open our doors.

349
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,739
HARKER: Hey, gents!

350
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,374
Don't make no move
toward your guns!

351
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,277
And who says so?
Me.

352
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,411
Acting Sheriff
Harker Wilkins.

353
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:47,688
AII right, you just step right on
in there, gentlemen. That's fine.

354
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,385
Yes, here.

355
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:54,761
Now, on official orders from
elected Sheriff Lom Trevors,

356
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,324
you are directed
to give me your firearms.

357
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,795
Go on. Unstrap them now.

358
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,746
That's fine, that's fine.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.

359
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,679
Thank you.

360
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:22,084
Oh, now, here. You just put that
right back where you got it from.

361
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,194
You best to tell him.

362
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,323
He don't put it back,
he's gonna get in big trouble.

363
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:34,461
Oh, you best
to put it back, Mr. Jones.

364
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:37,930
Hmm.

365
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,901
There. Thank you kindly.

366
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:52,017
Hey, Deputy, would you mind filling
in some ofthe spaces with words?

367
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,157
Yeah, well,
you men is on my list.

368
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,154
Your what list?

369
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,661
Well, my list
of known transients,

370
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:03,899
placed in myjurisdiction by Sheriff Trevors
to be enacted upon in his absence.

371
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,169
Transients being found
in possession of firearms

372
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,672
while under my
aforementioned jurisdiction,

373
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:14,871
which is in violation of Article One
ofthe Temporary Transients Act,

374
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,540
and makes them subject to immediate
arrest and imprisonment.

375
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,140
This was Lom's idea?

376
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,742
Relax.

377
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,686
He's just trying to make sure
we stay out oftrouble, huh?

378
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,416
Oh, we're fine without a gun?
Uh-huh.

379
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,220
What other kind of
special rules you got?

380
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,727
Well, now there's Article Two,

381
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,128
which says that ifthere's
any trouble in the whole town,

382
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,793
that's from a busted window
to a throwed horseshoe,

383
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,202
that I am to pick up and
arrest all known transients.

384
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,938
(BOTH GROANING)

385
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,174
Hey, how many transients
you got on that list?

386
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,474
Two.

387
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,781
Oh, cheer up, Kid.

388
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,517
If it's worth having, it's
worth giving something up for.

389
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,217
Lom's only testing us.

390
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:05,792
Yeah, he gave us wings
and took away the sky.

391
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,354
Mr. Smith! Mr. Jones!

392
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:13,496
I'm sorry. We hadn't really
completed our discussions

393
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,095
when I had to break away.

394
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,969
Hadn't we?
No.

395
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,805
I could certainly
use you, in the bank.

396
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,805
You mean to work there?

397
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,408
Inside, ma'am?

398
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,345
But you don't have to make
your decision right now.

399
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,543
We'll take the jobs.
Huh?

400
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,220
Why not? And I for one
am not too proud.

401
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,950
Like Miss Porter says, it's
only till her Pa gets back.

402
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,618
And, well,
look at it this way.

403
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,684
We're strangers
in a strange town,

404
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,788
but inside a bank,
why, we'll be right at home.

405
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:45,198
Kind of keep our hands
in the... So to speak.

406
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,065
Well, I...
Ma'am, excuse me.

407
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,504
We're really gonna have to talk
this up between the two of us

408
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,337
if you don't mind.
Not at all.

409
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,673
I'm only thrilled you'll even
consider helping me out

410
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,735
in Daddy's absence.

411
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:59,840
Could I possibly hope for an answer
by the close of business today?

412
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,885
Oh, oh, oh, of course, ma'am.

413
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,977
One way or another.
Yes, of course.

414
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,784
Thank you. Goodbye.
Goodbye.

415
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,721
You...

416
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:32,939
And I still say, why not?

417
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,417
You know, the sooner we grab off
ourselves some regularjobs,

418
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,511
the sooner we gonna get off
that list oftransients,

419
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,886
and the sooner we gonna get
our shooting irons back.

420
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,117
What's old Lom gonna think
we're up to, though,

421
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,160
if he hears we're
working in the bank?

422
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,830
I don't know about
that other one,

423
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,104
but I bet you a dollar
that's Kid Curry.

424
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,367
Just Iike when I seen them
riding through Fort Griffin,

425
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,204
one jump ahead ofthe posse.

426
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,983
Then there's
the constant temptation,

427
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,145
which I ain't sure
I got the strength to resist.

428
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,519
Hey, you,
at the end ofthe bar.

429
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,789
Not you. You.

430
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:24,161
Me and my friend here just been
wondering who it is you resemble.

431
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,230
Well, my mother mostly.
So they tell me.

432
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:31,607
(SNORTS)

433
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,200
Well, now I see
why you don't wear a gun,

434
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,472
when you can shoot off
your mouth that way.

435
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,083
Well, you know
what we got here, Mr. Smith?

436
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,512
We got ourselves a walk-off.

437
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,978
No, no, no,
don't get started.

438
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:51,155
Walk-off?
I don't Iike that, mister.

439
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,491
And I don't even know
what it means.

440
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,759
Well, then, I'm gonna tell you.
No.

441
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,427
You see when the good Lord
was making men,

442
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,403
he got a whole bunch ofthem
all whomped up together.

443
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,066
And then he decided to knock
off for the rest ofthe day,

444
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,075
thinking he'd put
the brains in later.

445
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,243
But guess what happened?

446
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,972
A whole bunch ofthem critters
just upped and walked off

447
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,516
(MIMICKING INAUDIBLY)
before he ever got back.

448
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,687
And that's what we got here,
walk-off.

449
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,756
Don't you push him.
You can't back it up.

450
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,425
Sir, I would Iike to apologize
for my friend.

451
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,559
And also want you to be sure

452
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,502
that you keep on noticing
that he ain't wearing a gun.

453
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,799
Neither am I.

454
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,505
Neither am I.

Don't let that stop you, in
case you feel Iike reaching.

457
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,022
Okay, Heyes, step aside.

458
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,563
No! No, you can't.

459
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,098
He's asking for it.

460
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,725
AII right. I'm asking
for something, too.

461
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,031
Something we ain't never
had a chance at before!

462
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,333
We ain't got no chance now
that eyeballer knows who I am!

463
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,398
But he can't be sure. Not unless
you go and prove it for him!

464
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,540
Okay. We'll play it your way.

talking it over

00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,859
and he'd Iike to apologize.
He'd what?

469
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:40,827
Yes, sir, that's a fact. I'd Iike
to apologize. I'm very sorry.

470

I've got a big mouth.

471

Yes, sir.

No guts.

You'd better be careful when you
stand up on your hind legs that way.

475
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,222
You might be confused
with something human.

Yes, sir.
I'II remember that.

477
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,224
You're right. He isn't the man
I thought he was.

478
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,660
But even so,
I don't Iike that face.

tomorrow in the a.m.

around here for me to see.

They're camped a couple miles
south of here.

They'II be pushing them beeves
through here in the morning,

stay hid till they're gone

I don't know if a transient can
Iegally hold ajob in Porterville.

499

Well, he can't 'cause the minute
he's got a job, he ain't transient.

500

being about 10 minutes ago.

ruling from the Sheriff...

something in it for you boys.

507
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,312
Sent it by telegraph, too.

508
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,913
Says here, "Tell Smith and
Jones everything looks good."

509
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:20,260
Now, I Iike to keep
my $100 bills in piles of 10,

510
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,856
and my $10 bills
in piles of 100.

511
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,129
And on my righÍ.

512
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:30,936
I'd Iike to have a pile
of $50 bills, 20 ofthem,

513
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:34,842
and 20 $50 bills on my left.

514
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:39,075
And the ones, you keep them...
What's the matter?

515
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,551
Oh, I don't know.

516
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:47,354
No, nothing, Mr. Pincus. I think
I gotta get some fresh air.

517
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,255
You look a little bilious.

518
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,418
Uh-huh.

519
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,639
(GROANS)

520
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,539
I've got green spots
in front of my eyes.

521
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,912
I've got fives and tens.
I don't know if I can take it.

522
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,814
Iwasjust thinking how natural
you looked behind them bars.

523
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:22,023
Leastwise, I ain't got time
to be tempted by Miss Porter.

524
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,825
Hello. Hello. Mayl
talk to you for a minute?

525
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:26,952
(CLEARS THROAT)

526
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,989
Mr. Jones, I wonder if we might
get together tonight for dinner?

527
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:32,758
To discuss security.

528
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,633
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but
I've other plans for tonight.

529
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,884
Who's that?

530
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,350
Me.

531
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,727
What do you want?

532
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:09,266
Well, first off, I'd Iike you to notice
there ain't nobody around to watch us now.

533
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,767
And I'd Iike you to notice
that I am wearing a gun.

534
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,205
You looking
for trouble?

535
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,266
No.

536
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,675
No, no trouble.

537
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,079
Just here to give you
a little piece of advice.

538
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,011
Don't take this herd
through Porterville.

539
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,251
Take the other road up
through Salt River.

540
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,291
You're given
the orders, mister.

541
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,053
I expect you can back them up.

542
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,425
There's two of us
and one of you.

543
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,464
That's two guns
against one.

544
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,226
That don't hardly seem fair.

545
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,799
Yeah, it's fair.

546
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:42,004
You see, this gun of mine
shoots two bullets at one time.

547
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,006
Huh? Now, what's that
supposed to mean?

548
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,969
Just what I said.

549
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,333
Here's one.

550
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,113
That's the other one.

551
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,575
That's two.

552
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,452
Get the idea?

553
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,132
Yes, sir.

554
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,033
We'll be going
by way of Salt River.

555
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,108
Thought you might.

556
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,647
Good night, boys.

557
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,788
Well, you can sleep easy.

558
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,628
Them boys ain't gonna be driving
that herd through town after all.

559
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,602
You didn't go up...
Oh, no, no, no, no.

560
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,669
No, Ijust suggested
a safer road.

561
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,332
So all our troubles
are over.

562
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,261
I don't Iike it.

563
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,193
Bank sits right there
next to Sheriff's office.

564
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,938
I wish Heyes was here
to think it out.

565
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:31,603
If I couldn't figure it out better than him
any day of the week, I'd just plum quit.

566
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:35,307
Tomorrow morning, we'll just
take that little bank

567
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,944
without Hannibal Heyes
and the Kid.

568
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,803
(CLEARING THROAT)
AII right, now.

569
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,481
We're all gonna
just walk in there,

570
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,140
looking innocent and normal.

571
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,253
Well, anyway, we're all
just gonna walk in.

572
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,261
And I'm gonna go first.

573
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,364
I'm gonna sashay
right up to the teller

574
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,127
and I'm gonnatell him to fill
this bag up full of money.

575
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,370
Uh, rest of you,

576
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,698
you... Listen,
why don't you just

577
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,109
stand around,
ready to cover me

578
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,147
in case we have to
shoot our way out?

579
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,244
Ain't you nervous, Wheat?
Huh?

580
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,247
Well, you've never done
first bandit before.

581
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,384
Who's nervous?
I ain't nervous.

582
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,399
Don't move and don't holler,
'cause this is a stickup.

583
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,114
(WHISPERING) What are
you doing back there?

584
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,586
One thing I ain't doing
is getting robbed.

585
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,017
Put that gun away.

586
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,856
0h, yeah?

587
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,093
Just read that.

588
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,890
Why do I have
to read that?

589
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,232
I wrote it!
Now, you get out of here.

590
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,369
Now, wait just a minute.

591
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,062
Do you mean to say
that you're...

592
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,139
That you're
Iegally working here?

593
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,369
Yes, I am.

594
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,775
Then you ain't got no right
to tell me not to rob it.

595
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,743
I'm only telling you
as a friend

because this here bank is

wait outside

while me and Heyes
talk to Wheat there.

Amnesty.

612
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,342

He's talking with the governor
right at this very minute.

617

He's talking to the governor?
For you two?

618
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,087
Well, yeah.

619
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,132
Now, we'd have put in
for you, too,

620
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,633
but we didn't know
where you were.

621

As soon as we get it, it's a cinch
for you and all the rest ofthem.

'Cause... Well, we're much
bigger crooks than you are.

You really think
we got a chance?

624
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,708
Sure, and tell you what.
You take the boys,

you go Iay Iow
for a couple days.

Well, go over
to Salt River.

627
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,016
And then, as soon as
we get the good word,

628
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,215
we'll bust over on
and tell you.

629

Ain't that gonna be
a nice surprise?

to seven sorry lives of crime.

Glad you see
the advantage, Wheat.

00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,058
Go on out there
and tell the boys.

633
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,535
Right, right.

634
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,970
We'll be waiting
for the word.

635
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,371
Yeah.

636
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,751
Well, what'd they say?

637
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,125
What are they up to?

638
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:52,332
They're fixing to rob
the bank without us.

639
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,085
That man you were
talking to

640
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,853
and those other men,
what did they want?

CURRY: Well, they're just
looking for work, ma'am.

642
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,858
Poor devils, we told them
to try Salt River.

643
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:27,532
Oh, well, they certainly
do seem grateful.

644
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:31,930
By the way, ma'am.

645
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:34,567
Sorry I couldn't take you up
on that dinner last night.

646
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,274
But I am free tonight.

647
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,145
How about you and me
doing the town?

648
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,809
Why, I'd love to.

649
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,145
Come on.

650
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,881
Now, wait. What's the idea rousting
a man out of bed Iike that?

651
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,889
You'll see.
Come on, come on.

652
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,885
What, now?

653
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,993
Just...
Just wait a minute.

654
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,248
Miss Porter,
can you get home by yourself?

655
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,379
Well, I usually do, but...

656
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,426
Well, then I'II be saying good
night to you now. Sorry, ma'am.

657
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,620
Never mind.

Hey, what's the trouble?

659
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,928
You'll see. Come on.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

661
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,315
Look at them.

662
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,516
Give me a good one.

663
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,252
Okay.
A pair of eights good?

664
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,659
So, what's wrong with them?
Who are they?

665
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,196
Transients.

666
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:04,096
Listen, they was over to the bank
this morning looking for work.

667
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,761
And don't you deny it because
I've got a full report.

668
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,235
Who's denying it?

669
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,033
We told them to go over
to Salt River.

670
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,437
Yeah, but they didn't do it.

671
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,105
Come here.

672
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,205
Bartender here tells me
they've been sitting

673
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,305
right in that spot
for 14 hours.

674
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,873
Well, that doesn't make it
our responsibility.

675
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,545
Yeah, but I got a feeling
that you know who they are.

676
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,780
What?

677
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,450

00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,517
I said.

679
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,430
I got a feeling
that you know who they are.

680
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,522
Yeah, how come?

681
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,931
Well, 'cause
two oftheir horses

682
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,468
got the same brand
on them as yours have.

683
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:42,965
Now...

684
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,166
We bought them broomtails
off a herd

685
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,731
must have been 2,000 strong.

686
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,403
Now, it's just likely
somebody else bought a couple.

687
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,238
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but,
they're still transients.

688
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,341
And as such,
is subject to all the rules

689
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,682
and regulations
applying to same.

690
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:02,054
So, I got to go in there
and take their guns.

691
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,797
He's about to get
his head blowed off.

692
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,607
Well, now, boys, I'II just
have to take your guns

693
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,807
until you decide
to ride out of town.

694
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,383
Where did you hear that?

695
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,946

Well, Kid.

699
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,093
Looks Iike it's time
for us to stand up

700
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,194
and be counted
on his side ofthe Iaw.

701
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:50,999
Let's go.

702
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,534
Transients?

703
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,068
Sounds Iike a hanging offense
if ever I heared one.

704
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,204
0h. no. no, no.

705
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,010
Nothing serious
Iike that at all.

706
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,107
Just means I got to
take your guns.

707
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,848
(CLEARS THROAT) Oh, I guess...
lfthem's the rules,

708
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,755
I guess we didn't
know the rules.

709
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:12,293
Well, we'd be more than
happy to oblige, Sheriff.

710
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,022
That's all there is to it.
You'll see.

711
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,825
Thank you.
Thank you kindly, gentlemen.

712
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:19,197
There we are.
Thank you very kindly.

713
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:23,430
There, now. You see there? Transients
ain't necessarily hostile.

714
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:26,964
Hmm?

715
00:49:32,937 --> 00:49:35,577
I thought you was gonna
wait over at the Salt River.

716
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:38,586
What difference does it make,
as long as we're waiting?

717
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,488
Oh, I don't know.

718
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:43,657
But do you have to do it right here?
Right out in public?

719
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:51,093
AII right,
I'II tell you the truth.

720
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,193
We just about busted.

721
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,235
And me and my horse is
just plum stove in.

722
00:49:59,263 --> 00:50:02,506
Those few miserable dollars
Iying out there on that table,

723
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,476
that's all the cash we've got
in the world between us.

724
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:06,907
So?

725
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,474
So we can't...

726
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,150
We can't afford
no place to stay.

727
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,521
But you see,
if we just sit here

728
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,492
passing the same few
miserable dollars

729
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,187
back and forth
between us,

730

buying a short beer
every now and then, well,

731
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,963
we can't get throwed out.

732
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,604
And we have got
a roof over our heads.

733
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,437
Just as long as we don't
let no one else in the game

734
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,637
who might walk off
with what little we got.

735
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,940
Yeah.

736
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:40,608
Now, hey, come on. Now, now,
don't be so down, you know.

737
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,878
You won't have long to wait.
Now, Lom's gonna be back

738
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,977
tomorrow night, 11:15 train.

739
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,817
You just sit tight, huh?

740
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,118
Yeah, well, we're just
sitting here waiting.

741
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,584

AII right, gentlemen,
what's the name ofthis game?

744
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:26,841
Yes, sir.

745
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,210
It's them transients. They're still
sitting around that poker table.

746
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,913
About 22 hours now.

747
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:33,977
Must be a big game.

748
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,251
No, ain't never been
more than $12 in the pot.

749
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,720
And it look Iike
they discourage new money.

750
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,985
I can't figure that out.

751
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,327
Well, maybe
they're waiting for someone.

752
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,161
Or got nothing better
to do.

753
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:51,029
Look, you got their guns,
they're staying put.

754
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,405
What more do you want?

755
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,367
Yeah.

756
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,277
I sure will be glad that Sheriff
gets back tonight, though.

757
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,771
Yeah.

760

we're gonna be sitting
smack under that safe,

instead of dirt.</i>

tells us

764
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,086
when we meet that train
tonight,

765
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,817
we better not plan
on staying here.

766
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,622
Now, where are they going?

767
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,633

right now. Weren't you?

772
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,288
Yeah, we just heard
they're taking on hands

773
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,953
over to the Tumble T.

774
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:55,957
So, we're on our way.

775

Oh, listen, Mr. Deputy.
Mmm-hmm?

778
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,999
You wouldn't mind,
would you,

779
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,631
if we just have ourselves
maybe just one little

780
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,404
extra hand of poker before we left town?
I mean, would you?

781
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,378
Oh, I reckon not. You boys sure
have been cooperative and all.

782

Yeah, of course, I'II have
to take my leave of you.

Yeah, well, you just
tell that Sheriff,

786
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:23,218
as far as we're concerned, he can just
leave you in charge any old time.

787

Well, now, thank you, gents.
Thank you, yes.

788

How come you sit still
for 36 hours,

795
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,885
then pick a time Iike this
to decamp?

796

We're not going no place.

when Lom gets back?

799

I mean, if you ain't
got that amnesty?

800
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,129
Figured we'd better
have our guns, just in case.

a point there, Heyes.

01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,729
No, Kid, this is one bank
we gotta blow by ourselves.

850
01:00:25,489 --> 01:00:27,025
You know, Heyes,

851
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,395
you've got a real big heart.

852
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,576
Yeah.

853
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:54,426
I can see it! We're
smack-dab under the safe.

854
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:08,146
There she is.
We're right on top of her.

855
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,364
We know the Deputy's
gonna be waiting

856
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,339
at the station at 11:15.

857
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,206
It's a good three minutes
from the station to the bank.

858
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,111
It should give us
just time enough

859
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:42,150
to grab the money and run
before Lom gets back.

860
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,213
So, that's when we blow it up.

861
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,777
At exactly 11:15.

862
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,015
WHEAT: 11:05.

863
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,356
I don't know, Wheat. That's
an awful lot of dynamite.

864
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,896
Yeah, that's an awful
lot of safe we got up there.

865
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,310
KYLE: We'll be long gone out
ofthis tunnel when she blows.

866
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,840
It's gonna be a big one.

867
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,531
CURRY: You sure we ain't
overdoing it?

868
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,959
Kid, may I remind you,

869
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:38,872
we are dealing with
a Brooker 404.

870
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,815
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

871
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,609
There. Howdy, Harker.

872
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:57,743
Howdy, Sheriff.

873
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:58,979
You arrest those two fellows
Iike I said?

874
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,283
I sure did.
Everything's under control.

875
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:47,626
You all right?

876
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:51,401
I don't feel a thing.

877
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:53,173
HEYES: What happened?

878
01:08:54,664 --> 01:08:56,575
I can't figure it out, Kid.

879
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,904
I don't know, Heyes.

880
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,345
But it must have been
awful good dynamite.

881
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,115
That's what happened, Heyes.

882
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,077
They're what happened.

883
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,846
AII right, boys.

884
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:43,747
That don't belong to you.

885
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:45,349
Nowjust Ieave the money
where it is.

886
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,485
Try and stop us.

887
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:50,555
HEYES: Don't you dare,
Wheat.

888
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,963
(GUNS FIRING)

889
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,125
Don't you dare!

890
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:56,268
Go on, go on.
Go on, get!

891
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,668
CURRY: Put it down,
you heard him.

892
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:01,868
Get! Go on! Get!

893
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,340
And don't come back.

894
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:06,713
And don't try that again.

895
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:17,079
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, you were wonderful!

896
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,921
You were wonderful!
You were wonderful!

897
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,757
Just the two of you
against those men.

898
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:23,957
Lom, you should have seen it.
I saw it all.

899
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,125
Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones
saved the bank.

900
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:28,533
They fought along those
outlaws side-by-side.

901
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,104
"Put that down," they said.
"That doesn't belong to you."

902
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,039
They fought for that moneyjust
Iike it was their very own.

903
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,537
LOM: Uh-huh?

904
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:40,274
Well, I think even the governor might
be interested in what they did.

905
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,606
I'd Iike
to discuss that, boys,

906
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:47,420
if you wouldn't mind stepping
into my office for a moment.

907
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:56,523
Yahoo, we got it!
We did get the amnesty.

908
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,122
Yes, uh-huh.

909
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,463
But, please, please,
don't tell me anything

910
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,264
about what happened
here tonight.

911
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:05,996
Hey, Lom.
Yeah?

912
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:10,203
One thing, though.
If we did get the amnesty,

913
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:11,869
how come
you had us arrested?

914
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,973
Well, I was afraid
the governor's telegram

915
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:18,678
would get here before I did,
setting out the terms.

916
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,584
And I was afraid
the terms might scare you off

917
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,316
before I could explain
about it.

918
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,481
Terms?

919
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:25,719
What terms?

920
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,289
Well,

921
01:11:31,187 --> 01:11:33,599
you've been granted
provisional amnesty.

922
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:37,136
Course, the governor can't come
flat out and give you amnesty now

923
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:39,605
without Ietting himself in
for a lot of criticism.

924
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,468
So...

925
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,168
First, you gotta prove
you deserve it.

926
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,340
Till then, only you and me
and the governor will know.

927
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,849
It'Il be our secret.

928
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,274
Secret.

929
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,819
How long?
The governor figures a year.

930
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,086
Figures if you can stay
out oftrouble for 12 months,

931
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,523
you can do it forever.

932
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,319
Then you got it,
the whole thing.

933
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:03,762
Fresh start,
clean bill of health, amnesty.

934
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:07,893
So, all we've got to do is just
stay out of trouble for one year.

935
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,635
But we'll still be wanted.

936
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:12,969
We'll still be blamed for
everything that goes wrong.

937
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,633
We'll still be
the same men we was

938
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,677
before you talked
to the governor?

939
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,905
That's true.
But it's only for 12 months.

940
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,413
You can do it, boys.
I'm sure you can.

941
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:24,650
Just Iike you stayed
out oftrouble

942
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,313
for the last few days
right here in Porterville.

943
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:30,317
Now, that wasn't so hard,
really, was it?
