[Screams]

4
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,950
Call the cops! [Panting]

5
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:16,582
Excuse me.

6
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,125
Finally! We got to get going.

7
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:23,492
Vic: What the hell happened here?

8
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,345
[Sighs] This kid's name
is Marshall Jeffords.

9
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,979
- He's part of a Bighorn Horizons Group.
- A what?

10
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,779
Wilderness leadership, uh,
courses for young people.

11
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,946
You mean one of those "ropes
and trust falls" kind of deals?

12
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,245
[Chuckles] It's more than that.

13
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:35,046
It changed my life.

14
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:37,746
Anyway, Marshall found their group leader,

15
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:39,312
Adam Kaufman, dead.

16
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:41,245
He's at their campsite, about two miles in.

17
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:42,846
- You call Bighorn Horizons?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:44,679
The only good signal is
over by the trail map.

19
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,312
They're en route.

20
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:48,612
That's Branch's truck. Did he go on ahead?

21
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:49,779
I didn't see him.

22
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,912
Marshall, this is the Sheriff.

23
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:54,646
Marshall, I'm Sheriff Longmire.

24
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,412
You think you could show us the way?

25
00:02:56,413 --> 00:02:58,579
You mean I gotta go back up there?

26
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,979
Been here two weeks.

27
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,879
Last night was solo night.

28
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,979
We all had to be out here completely alone.

29
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,712
Not supposed to come back
to camp till 24 hours is up.

30
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:17,912
It's intense, right?

31
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:19,412
So, what made you come back early?

32
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:20,712
Marshall: I didn't.

33
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:22,245
Time was up by my count.

34
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:24,113
Others should be back by now.

35
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:28,712
They told me I was gettin' away

36
00:03:28,713 --> 00:03:30,414
from seeing dudes get whacked.

37
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,545
This how you found him?

38
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:36,746
Marshall: Nah. W-when I found him,

39
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:39,113
he... he didn't have that
pen sticking out of his neck.

40
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:41,742
You did an emergency tracheotomy?

41
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,823
Man, they showed us how to
do that back at the office

42
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,912
before we even got up here.

43
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:47,445
I figured he... he passed out,

44
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,013
hit his head on a rock or something.

45
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,445
I even did mouth to mouth

46
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:53,145
and, uh, t-t-t-that heimlich maneuver.

47
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,879
I mean, we 100 miles from
nowhere. I had to try somethin'.

48
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,412
Walt: There's nothing you
could have done, Marshall.

49
00:03:58,413 --> 00:03:59,779
He was already dead.

50
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,846
Suffocated... after he got hit on the head.

51
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:03,912
Susan: Adam?

52
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:06,679
- Ma'am. Ma'am.
- Adam.

53
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,178
Adam?

54
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:09,812
Still trying to figure
out what happened here.

55
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:11,479
We need your help.

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,246
I understand your company
put these trips together.

57
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:16,046
- Uh, yes.
- Okay.

58
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,679
Now, we can't seem to
locate the last six students.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,046
I need to talk to them.

60
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,746
Marshall says they're soloing.

61
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:22,646
Any idea where?

62
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,946
[Sighs]

63
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:27,113
They're supposed to stay
within whistling distance.

64
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:30,047
[Whistles]

65
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:34,712
Yeah, they should, uh,
they should whistle back.

66
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:35,979
[Person whistles]

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,879
Well, that's one.

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,379
You know this area well?

69
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,145
- I used to lead these trips.
- Good.

70
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:45,145
Work with Deputies Moretti and Ferguson.

71
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:46,879
See if you can find the others.

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,476
I'll take Marshall back to the station.

73
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:50,679
Marshall, you ready to go?

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Hell yeah.

75
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:06,046
Ruby, this is Marshall.

76
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,712
He could probably use something to eat.

77
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:08,979
What I really need is a nap.

78
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,646
I ain't slept in a week.

79
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,679
Well, there's a cot right
around there, to your right.

80
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,979
Cool.

81
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,345
Have you heard from Branch?

82
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:18,079
No. I assumed he was with you.

83
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,712
[Sighs] If he calls in,

84
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:21,779
I need to talk to him right away.

85
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,679
Should I be worried?

86
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,946
Is there a problem?

87
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:28,979
I'm not laying there. That's a jail, man.

88
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,446
Not if I leave the door open.

89
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,679
[Knock on door]

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,779
[Sighs]

91
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,746
Come in. [Clears throat]

92
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:42,912
Sean, uh, Vic's not here at the moment.

93
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:44,912
Um... You really shouldn't use that door.

94
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:46,013
It's... it's private.

95
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,646
I know, but this is private.

96
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,979
How so?

97
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,379
I understand if I want

98
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,979
to get a restraining order against someone,

99
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,113
I need to talk to you.

100
00:05:53,114 --> 00:05:55,746
Who do you need a restraining order for?

101
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:57,512
You know, I'm not sure yet.

102
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,813
That was in my mailbox this morning.

103
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:08,812
Not gonna say anything?

104
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,212
Oh, that's right. You're
not much of a talker.

105
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:14,013
It's a couple of weeks back.

106
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:15,479
We were in Arizona, on a case.

107
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,946
I assume Vic told you about that.

108
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,113
She told me about it.

109
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,846
I just wanted to see how you'd react

110
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,079
when you saw the picture.

111
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,479
Little tactic I learned from my wife.

112
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,579
Huh. What'd Vic say about the photo?

113
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,912
Did she know what this means?

114
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:29,746
I-I-I haven't talked to her about it yet.

115
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:31,113
Just lead to an argument.

116
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:33,746
She'd probably think I
had someone following her.

117
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:36,013
Did you?

118
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:38,212
No.

119
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:39,812
Who do you think took the photo?

120
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,679
Ed Gorski.

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,712
I gather you know about Gorski,

122
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,212
so you can understand, Sheriff,

123
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:47,779
why I'd be a little sensitive

124
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,679
about Vic's relationships
with her superior officers.

125
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,145
Hmm.

126
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:54,080
You don't have anything
to worry about from me.

127
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:58,013
Okay. Great.

128
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:01,297
So I guess the restraining
order's just for Gorski then.

129
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,145
[Door opens]

130
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:07,347
[Door closes]

131
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,557
Marshall?

132
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,553
Oh, my God.

133
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:20,820
Vic: Two of the Bighorn Horizons
students came back in to camp.

134
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,920
Ferg and the Taylors are out
looking for the other two.

135
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:27,054
Okay.

136
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,086
Something wrong?

137
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:31,486
Huh? Uh, no. No. No.

138
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:34,621
Just, uh... Just worried
about those missing kids.

139
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:43,821
[Foliage rustling]

140
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:50,288
[Man and woman moaning]

141
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,887
[Clears throat]

142
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:59,153
[Coughs loudly]

143
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:01,255
Man: Yeah!

144
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,320
Sheriff's department!

145
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:06,020
- What the... oh, my God!
- What?

146
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,420
Oh, no.

147
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,286
[Sighs]

148
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,054
This kind of thing never
happened on my trip.

149
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,420
[Sighs]

150
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:15,687
How well did you know Adam?

151
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,920
Noel: He thought he was the Great Santini.

152
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:19,987
He was always like, "out
here, you will find your edges,

153
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:22,153
and those edges will carve
out who you really are."

154
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:24,174
Some of us could handle
that. Some of us couldn't.

155
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:25,186
Like who?

156
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:27,353
Wolverine.

157
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,987
Who's Wolverine?

158
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:31,787
He's not on my list of students.

159
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,820
Right. His real name is Trey Campbell,

160
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,453
but e-everyone called him Wolverine.

161
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,121
Why?

162
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,887
He was always talking about comic books

163
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,086
and... and horror movies
and playing with his knife.

164
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,086
And he's always fantasizing about death...

165
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:47,253
who might be attacked by a bear first,

166
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:49,753
what it would feel like to
have your entrails ripped out.

167
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:52,353
How'd Wolverine get on
with your group leader?

168
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:54,645
Marshall: That boy was not
equipped for Bighorn Horizons,

169
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:55,920
and Adam...

170
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,620
he didn't have much patience for him.

171
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,987
Two days ago, Wolverine
just refused to go on.

172
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:02,987
He sat down on the ground in protest,

173
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,353
and Adam was like, "fine."

174
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:05,520
And he just left him there.

175
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,520
And he hasn't been seen since?

176
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:11,453
You guys think this Wolverine
guy is capable of killing Adam?

177
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:14,487
[Telephone rings]

178
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:18,887
Sheriff's office. This is Ruby.

179
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:21,887
Walt, Ferg.

180
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:23,119
Okay. I thought I saw him.

181
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,386
Deputy Ferguson left word.

182
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:25,787
He said he found another campsite,

183
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,286

See, he marked the way
to the campsite for you.

188
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,221
We'll call as soon as we're in range.

189
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:46,020
So, this is gonna sound weird,

190
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:52,275
but... You seem quiet... er today.

191
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:56,153
Sean came by.

192
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:58,486
Sean came by today. Why?

193
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:01,520
'Cause someone sent him
a photograph of you and me

196
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:07,787
Did he freak out at you?

197
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:13,054
He's worried about you, and so am I.

198
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:16,253
Gorski's still following you.

199
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,520
There was a "32" on
the back of the picture.

Nope.

Vic, you said Gorski
had dropped the charges

203
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,587
and left town.

204
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:29,321
I thought he did. Maybe I was wrong.

205

What exactly did he say to you?

You know... Right now, I
think we got bigger problems.

anything more for a while,

to know if they matched.

his parole perimeter?

So, can you send someone
out to check on him,

282
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:03,815
or should we send a car over?

283

If there's a problem with
Henry, I can go check on him.

284

We can send a Deputy over right away.

It was the middle of the night.

I was almost asleep, and
then I heard footsteps.

287
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:22,015
I thought maybe it was a
bear, but then I heard a voice.

288
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:26,581
He just kept whispering
my name, over and over.

289
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:29,581
Did you recognize who it was?

290
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:34,815
Well, he kept putting on a
creepy movie-villain voice,

291
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:38,249
so I was pretty sure it was Wolverine.

292
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:45,581
I thought he was going to rape me...

293
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:48,782
So I just got up and ran.

294
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:53,515
I forgot how close I was
to the edge, and I fell off.

295
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:58,015
Why did you think he was going to rape you?

296
00:15:58,016 --> 00:16:02,314
He was always staring at me,

297
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:05,516
making inappropriate sexual remarks.

298
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:12,048
One time, I caught him
going through my bag.

299
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:15,182
He said I was stealing his underwear,

300
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,383
- but I think he was stealing mine.

301
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:27,882
Did your leader know about
your issues with Wolverine?

302
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:30,515
Oh, Adam insists

303
00:16:30,516 --> 00:16:33,348
that we work out our
problems amongst ourselves.

304
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:35,414
Are you a little afraid of Adam?

305
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:39,314
I know everybody else kind of is,

306
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:42,715
but I think Adam's really a big softie.

307
00:16:44,883 --> 00:16:49,815
Will you tell Adam that I didn't quit,

308
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:51,749

company calls our office

- Ah.

Well, most peyote dealers are licensed.

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,982
You cannot arrest them.

You know I'm gonna have to file
an official complaint, right?

364
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,281
Okay.

365
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,015
[Both laugh]

366
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:08,748
[Panting] Detective
Gorski, I would like to file

367
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,149
an official complaint...
Against this zipper.

368
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,149
Wow. You're really serious.

369
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,448
[Both laugh]

370
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:15,949
<i>[Music]</i>

371
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:22,882
Ferg: Decaf?

372
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:25,348
- Ruby: Good morning, Walt.
- Walt: Ruby.

373
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,149
Charlie Taylor came in about 20 minutes ago

374
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,314
with, uh, Mrs. McGill.

375
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:32,848
It's Wolverine's mother.

376
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,948
I put her in your office.

377
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:36,550
Thanks.

378
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:41,748
So, that gentleman said that
there had been a fatal accident,

379
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:43,815
that, uh, that... that
Trey's group leader was dead

380
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,149
and that Trey is still missing?

381
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,748
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,915
So, what are you doing to find him?

383
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,015
And how cold does it
get out there at night?

384
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,381
Oh, God.

385
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:54,815
I only sent him here because
he never leaves the house,

386
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:56,249
and I just wanted him to have

387
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,548
some sort of fresh-air
experience with other kids,

388
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,281
but he is not equipped for this at all.

389
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,281
Mrs. McGill, there's no reason to believe

390
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:03,715
we won't find your son.

391
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:05,782
All those kids out there were missing.

392
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:07,815
Gradually, they're all showing up.

393
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,048
The other campers tell me

394
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:10,915
that, uh, Trey is quite an artist.

395
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,648
Mrs. McGill: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

396
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,149
He has an avid imagination.

397
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,948
You know kids today. They make things up

398
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,915
when they don't have problems of their own.

399
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,215
And I can assure you, my son
has everything that he wants.

400
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:21,748
Does he have a lot of friends?

401
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:25,182
I mean, he... he prefers
just keeping to himself.

402
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,815
I-I'm the same way.

403
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:29,115
What's his relationship
like with his father?

404
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:30,915
Oh, we divorced a long time ago.

405
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,215
- He... he moved away.
- Any pets?

406
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:37,049
Yeah. We had a cat.

407
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:42,381
Trey, uh, ever shown any
signs of a bad temper?

408
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:45,516
Get in fights, or...?

409
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:50,048
You know what is amazing

410
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,015
is all that sugar that he has eaten,

411
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:53,249
he has never had one cavity.

412
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,481
And I don't know if it's genetics

413
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,281
or just really good hygiene,

414
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,907
but, um, but I always
made sure that he flossed.

415
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:00,184
I just think that that is...

416
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,929
- [Cellphone vibrates]
- that's so important.

417
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,266
You know, I'm sorry. I should just...

418
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:05,848
Get this real quick.

419
00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:07,381
Hello.

420
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:09,314
Mm-hmm.

421
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:11,414
Okay.

422
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:14,715
Mm-hmm. I will.

423
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,848
You know, I should just let
you keep up with your search,

424
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:20,215
and I'll, uh, wait at
the hotel for an update.

425
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:22,082
Ma'am, who was that?

426
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,249
What?

427
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,249
Who called you?

428
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,249
Uh, my ex-husband.

429
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,149
You said he was out of the picture.

430
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,882
He's worried about his son.

431
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:32,082
Your ex-husband lives
right here in Wyoming?

432
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,215
Huh?

433
00:22:34,216 --> 00:22:37,715
That was a 307 area code.

434
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:39,882
May I see your phone, please?

435
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,882
Stop it!

436
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:45,515
Mrs. McGill! Stop it!

437
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:47,782
- No! No!
- Stop! Stop.

438
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,481
Was that your son?

439
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:55,149
Was that Trey?

440
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,717
Where is he? Where is he?

441
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,845
Geez, you guys, who died?

442
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:14,579
Shut the hell up, Wolverine.

443
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,721
Just having a little fun. [Scoffs]

444
00:23:16,722 --> 00:23:17,682
At least I'm not the one

445
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:20,246
who went to jail for stabbing some banger.

446
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,106
Walt: Hey! Hey!

447
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,171
Marshall: What?!

448
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:30,171
Take it easy, Marshall.

449
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:33,838
Now, you talk to Deputy Moretti
about that juvenile record.

450
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,004
Ferg, take Trey into my office.

451
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:38,371
I'll be right there.

452
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:49,704
Branch.

453
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:51,106
You look like hell.

454
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:54,838
Uh... I wasn't really

455
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,004
on top of my game yesterday morning.

456
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,538
Sorry I didn't call in, but I...

457
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,204
but you were too busy
running the same DNA tests

458
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:03,371
on David Ridges I ran three weeks ago.

459
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:06,304
I talked to Dr. Weston, and guess what?

460
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:07,771
The DNA's a match,

461
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:10,404
same as it was three weeks ago, so there.

462
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:14,771
You have your confirmation.
David Ridges is dead.

463
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:17,204
Are you ready to move on?

464
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,771
Actually, no...

465
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,771
'Cause neither of those samples

466
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:22,937
was David Ridges' DNA.

467
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:24,204
Whose was it?

468
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:26,571
They're mine.

469
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,738
I conducted a test.

470
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:30,638
I put my own hair and blood

471
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:33,838
on some animal remains and set it on fire.

472
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,304
Boom.

473
00:24:35,305 --> 00:24:37,671
Positive DNA match to myself.

474
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:41,771
So, you're proposing that
David faked his own suicide

475
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,504
with Nighthorse's help,

476
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:45,350
dripped some blood on an animal carcass,

477
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,304
and cremated it?

478
00:24:46,305 --> 00:24:50,380
And now I have proof that
your DNA can show up in ashes

479
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:51,905
and you can still be alive.

480
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:56,538
Let me reopen the David Ridges case.

481
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:02,404
We'll reopen the case after
I finish up with those kids

482
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,337
and after you take some actual days off.

483
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,671
You're overworked.

484
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,404
[Chuckles] So are you.

485
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:10,905
Take "yes" for an answer, Branch.

486
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,705
Okay.

487
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:25,037
How would you say

488
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,972
your Bighorn Horizons
leadership experience has gone?

489
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:34,404
This is about Jane, isn't it?

490
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:37,171
I heard you guys yelling in the woods.

491
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:38,604
So, is Jane alive or dead?

492
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,237
'Cause if she's dead, it's not my fault.

493
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,237
How is it not your fault?

494
00:25:42,238 --> 00:25:44,438
I was just playing around.

495
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:47,204
Look, all I did was sneak up on her tent

496
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:48,805
and whisper her name.

497
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:51,970
The freaking out and the
running off a cliff was her idea.

498
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:54,371
I don't know what she
thought I was gonna do.

499
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:56,738
Why didn't you go for help?

500
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:59,738
Uh, actually, I did try. I yelled.

501
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,471
But Adam, the great leader,

502
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:04,905
had spread everybody so far
apart, nobody could hear me.

503
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,805
And he abandoned me the day before,

504
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:09,004
so I had no idea where I was
or where anybody else was.

505
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:12,004
Then I realized everyone
would blame me, so I stopped.

506
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,838
And hid.

507
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,805
Indeed, until I could find
someone with a cellphone.

508
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:16,805
Then I called my mom.

509
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:18,104
Where is she, by the way?

510
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:19,171
She's supposed to pick me up.

511
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:21,304
Hotel.

512
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:23,671
She was tired from the trip, so...

513
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:26,937
So, is Jane alive or dead?

514
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:30,137
She's alive... But Adam's dead.

515
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,104
Right.

516
00:26:32,105 --> 00:26:34,271
Adam.

517
00:26:34,272 --> 00:26:36,304
How'd he die, anyway?

518
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:39,104
Stabbed with his own leatherman?

519
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:40,937
Did a bear claw him open

520
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:43,471
and eat his stomach full of power bars?

521
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:46,204
Was he hit on the head with a rock?

522
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,738
Come on, man. Tell me.

523
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,872
Why don't I just show you?

524
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:56,371
That's private.

525
00:26:57,338 --> 00:26:59,738
I have your drawing

526
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:03,672
depicting the way your leader was murdered.

527
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:06,771
I also have a bunch of campers

528
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:08,504
who all believe you could have done it.

529
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:10,604
Yeah, well, sure.

530
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:13,104
Those guys all think I'm a sociopath.

531
00:27:13,105 --> 00:27:15,571
I don't know. Maybe I am.

532
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:18,137
But not all sociopaths are killers.

533
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:21,037
Lots are C.E.O.'s or politicians.

534
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:23,937
At least I'm not a hypocrite like Adam.

535
00:27:23,938 --> 00:27:25,970
How was Adam a hypocrite?

536
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:28,838
He... he wasn't trying to test our limits.

537
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,823
He was trying to break
us... 'Cause it made him feel

538
00:27:31,824 --> 00:27:33,646
like he was better than us, but he wasn't.

539
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:36,805
And he didn't practice what he preached.

540
00:27:36,806 --> 00:27:39,438
He would lecture us about only packing in

541
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,970
what we absolutely needed to survive.

542
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,171
Know what I found in his pack?

543
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:46,937
Weed and condoms.

544
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:49,404
Jane said she caught you going
through her pack, as well.

545
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:50,704
Oh, I went through everybody's stuff.

546
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:52,137
It's a great way to get to know a person.

547
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,304
But you're missing the point.

548
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,204
Mr. perfect didn't have a first-aid kit.

549
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:58,204
He had prophylactics and cannabis.

550
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:01,004
So, was he planning on
surviving in the wild

551
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:04,337
or having a drug-induced
sex orgy with 18-year-olds?

552
00:28:04,338 --> 00:28:07,371
I understand Adam was pretty hard on you.

553
00:28:07,372 --> 00:28:10,171
Yeah, of course he was.

554
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:14,104
'Cause I was the only one
who saw through his bullshit.

555
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,905
But I didn't kill him.

556
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:24,438
So, uh, any leads on who shot you?

557
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,271
[Sighs]

558
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:29,438
Well, you were the last
one to pull a gun on me.

559
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,271
Oh, come on. I already explained it to Vic.

560
00:28:31,272 --> 00:28:32,337
You read the report.

561
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:35,037
Relax. I'm kidding.

562
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:36,471
I get why you were mad.

563
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:38,671
Yeah.

564
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:41,305
And, to put your mind at ease...

565
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,304
...I do have some other leads.

566
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:48,937
Well, that's good.

567
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:51,571
Hey, it's good to see you.

568
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:53,271
This is cool, you know?

569
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:57,238
We should... we should do
this again... just hang out.

570
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,005
Henry.

571
00:29:03,472 --> 00:29:05,305
How about right now?

572
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,872
I believe you have already paid.

573
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:32,937
So, Wolverine was telling the
truth about Marshall Jeffords.

574
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,937
He spent time in juvie
for stabbing another kid,

575
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:38,871
and he's also the one
who found the body, so...

576
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,704
So you think Marshall killed Adam

577
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:42,538
and covered it up by calling it in?

578
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,970
Sometimes, the most obvious
solution is the right one.

579
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:49,237
But why did he attempt
an emergency tracheotomy?

580
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:51,704
Regret?

581
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,304
[Sighs]

582
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,037
Look, Walt,

583
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,438
as much as I don't trust
this Wolverine freak,

584
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:59,504
he was telling the truth about Marshall,

585
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:01,970
and the list of what
everyone had in their packs

586
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:04,070
in his journals was totally accurate.

587
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,304
Except for the condoms and pot

588
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,970
that he said was in Adam's pack.

589
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:13,471
We have to remember that
Wolverine is a sociopath.

590
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:14,738
Among other qualities,

591
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:16,538
sociopaths are pretty good liars.

592
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:20,371
That kid's playing games with us.

593
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,472
Sounds familiar.

594
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,237
Gorski took that picture.

595
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:31,704
Why are you suddenly so sure?

596
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,371
Because of what he wrote on the back.

597
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,738
I'm still listening.

598
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,538
It's an apartment number, okay?

599
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:46,238
That's it. That's how I know.

600
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:49,538
What, you want all the details?

601
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:51,271
You brought it up.

602
00:30:51,272 --> 00:30:53,538
[Sighs]

603
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:57,171
32 is the number of the apartment

604
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,671
where we used to meet.

605
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:00,638
I was young, and it was like

606
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,337
this fun, secret game that we were playing,

607
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:05,671
and the more dangerous it
got, the more he liked it,

608
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,237
the more I didn't,

609
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:10,704
and it got to be too
much, so I ended it. But...

610
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,271
[Sighs]

611
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:14,305
...for Gorski, it's like it never stopped.

612
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:19,070
I did end it, Walt. I got married.

613
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:23,271
But Gorski's still playing.

614
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,541
[Sighs]

615
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,303
What does Sean have to say about all this?

616
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,872
I haven't been home.

617
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:32,538
You think avoiding him
will make things easier?

618
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:34,438
I am not avoiding him.

619
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:38,104
It's not unusual for me
to miss a night at home.

620
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:42,104
I have pulled many 24-hour
shifts in the past years.

621
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:43,871
In fact, I called him,

622
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,237
and he is on his way here to pick me up.

623
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,438
Okay.

624
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:52,104
[Clears throat]

625
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:53,504
[Sighs]

626
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:55,204
Where are you going?

627
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,137
I don't want to be around
when your husband gets here.

628
00:31:58,138 --> 00:31:59,404
[Sighs]

629
00:31:59,405 --> 00:32:01,745
The last thing he needs is
to find you here with me.

630
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:07,738
[Vic sighs]

631
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:09,338
What?

632
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:13,472
Adam Kaufman.

633
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:16,972
Maybe the killer was the one who found him.

634
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,471
[Door opens]

635
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:24,405
[Door closes]

636
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:39,026
[Knock on door]

637
00:32:39,027 --> 00:32:41,625
Yeah? Come on in.

638
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,726
Hi, Sheriff.

639
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:45,892
- Who is it, babe?
- It's the Sheriff.

640
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:47,926
Oh.

641
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:50,026
Hey, Sheriff. How are you?

642
00:32:50,027 --> 00:32:52,026
- Okay.
- Well, can I get you something?

643
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:55,026
- No, sir.
- Okay.

644
00:32:55,027 --> 00:32:56,525
Well, uh, what's the latest?

645
00:32:56,526 --> 00:33:00,259
I have some, uh, questions
about your program.

646
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,360
All right. Uh, whatever you need.

647
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,559
How well do you screen your students?

648
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,926
We have a rigorous application process.

649
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:10,026
Yeah, kids don't usually go on these trips

650
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:11,460
unless they're pretty driven.

651
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:15,126
Huh. What about criminal background checks?

652
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,059
Did you know that Marshall Jeffords

653
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,427
has a juvenile record?

654
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,492
Uh... We didn't know that.

655
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:26,026
Do you think Adam
Kaufman is an ideal leader

656
00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:27,226
for a kid like that?

657
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:28,826
I'm hearing from the students

658
00:33:28,827 --> 00:33:30,859
that Adam pushed them all way too hard.

659
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,126
If anyone could handle someone
like Marshall, it would be Adam.

660
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:39,592
He's one of the best Outdoor-Ed
teachers I've ever known.

661
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:41,026
I've led with him.

662
00:33:41,027 --> 00:33:43,126
I've seen him work wonders with kids.

663
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:46,059
Well, you seem to think
pretty highly of Adam.

664
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,625
So why were his students

665
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:50,171
spread so far apart on their solo outings

666
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:52,159
that their screams for
help couldn't be heard?

667
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,525
Why did he pack condoms on a trip

668
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:55,059
where you're only supposed to pack

669
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,560
what you're planning to use?

670
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,627
Was he having sex with these students?

671
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:05,893
I told you Adam was becoming a liability.

672
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:09,093
- Excuse me, sir.
- Charlie.

673
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,959
Susan.

674
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,559
Adam lost control out
there, and someone snapped.

675
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,694
Now, those kids were the only ones

676
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,260
that knew about the
location of his campsite.

677
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,761
Except for you.

678
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,661
I bet you know where all his spots are.

679
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,726
Did you know what he was up
to out there with those kids?

680
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,093
Did you go check on him and
catch him in the act, or...?

681
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:45,661
Adam would never take
advantage of his students.

682
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:50,394
Did you go out there, Susan?

683
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,193
[Clears throat]

684
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:09,193
You know, I went and talked
to H.R. about that transfer

685
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,026
that they offered me last year.

686
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:13,993
- The job in Australia?
- Mm-hmm.

687
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:18,892
I don't think Gorski would
be able to follow us there

688
00:35:18,893 --> 00:35:19,993
if we relocated.

689
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:21,426
[Sighs]

690
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:25,993
But... I don't think that
you would want to come.

691
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:31,393
[Sighs]

692
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:32,754
Sean, I know that you think

693
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,426
that there's something
going on between Walt and I,

694
00:35:34,427 --> 00:35:36,026
- but there's...
- I... I...

695
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:37,226
[sighs]

696
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:39,093
I don't think that there's anything

697
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:40,826
going on between you and Walt.

698
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:43,393
[Scoffs]

699
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:48,260
But I know there's nothing
going on between us.

700
00:35:50,827 --> 00:35:55,793
You're happier in this picture
than you ever are with me.

701
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:06,059
[Door opens]

702
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,627
[Door closes]

703
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm sorry for storming
out like that, Sheriff.

704
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:38,159
[Chuckling] It's been a hard
couple of days, you know?

705
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,726
I get it.

706
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:43,360
Adam found the edges in people,

707
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:46,859
carved out who they are.

708
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,892
He got to people.

709
00:36:48,893 --> 00:36:51,993
That's what all his students said.

710
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:55,259
Adam got to you.

711
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,093
Well, you know, it's not
just about the bad publicity.

712
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:04,059
Uh, I mean, this could
open us up to lawsuits,

713
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,460
and, uh, I... I just...

714
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:07,826
I just really don't want
to lose the business.

715
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:09,394
Or your wife.

716
00:37:19,294 --> 00:37:22,093
I think you should go.

717
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:27,059
Adam wasn't just out
there to lead students.

718
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,926
He was out there to meet someone in secret.

719
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:37,460
The pot and the other
evidence I couldn't find...

720
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:41,559
It was for a rendezvous... With Susan.

721
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,393
Stop.

722
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:47,226
You love your wife. I can see that.

723
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:50,126
That's why you followed
her that night, and...

724
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:51,592
[Sighs]

725
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:56,826
...that's why you removed
every trace of the affair...

726
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:58,793
After you killed Adam.

727
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:08,393
"Leave no trace."

728
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:11,327
That's the golden rule of the outdoorsman.

729
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:25,360
She doesn't know, does she?

730
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,326
She loves me.

731
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:31,327
At least, I think she does.

732
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,592
Adam was a... sickness.

733
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:41,592
She... she couldn't shake it.

734
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:44,193
[Chuckles]

735
00:38:44,194 --> 00:38:48,993
Even after we got married... move out here,

736
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,159
and I'm thinking we're
gonna have all this...

737
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,360
just us, together.

738
00:38:57,427 --> 00:39:00,492
And then I saw them...

739
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:04,460
And I knew that wasn't gonna happen.

740
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,993
Well, she's told me what she's done.

741
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:12,546
Now, do you want me to tell
her what you've done, or...

742
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:15,680
shall I stay here and let you?

743
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:27,955
[Door opens]

744
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:28,888
[Door closes]

745
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:30,555
[Sighs]

746
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:32,738
You know, when I said I wanted to hang out,

747
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,821
I thought there'd be...

748
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:39,055
more drinking or... or something.

749
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:42,488
Yeah, I wasn't totally straight with you.

750
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,754
Remember how I said

751
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:46,221
I had some other leads on who shot me?

752
00:39:46,222 --> 00:39:48,322
Yeah.

753
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:54,656
So... a-are we on a stakeout?

754
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,721
We are.

755
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:02,255
And I'm not really
supposed to be on the Rez

756
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:07,422
without official permission,
so... I needed your car.

757
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:11,788
You could have just asked.

758
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:16,155
So, uh... Who we staking out?

759
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:21,654
The guy who lives there is a peyote dealer.

760
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:25,788
He... is he the shooter?

761
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:28,888
[Engine stops]

762
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:33,587
[Door closes]

763
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:36,022
- Wait here.
- Wait.

764
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:48,687
What the hell are you doing?!

765
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:51,522
[Both grunting]

766
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:02,088
Drive!

767
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:04,321
[Engine turns over]

768
00:41:04,322 --> 00:41:06,522
[Engine revs]

769
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:18,288
Hey, what's going on in here?

770
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:21,355
Oh.

771
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:25,355
This is a walk down memory Lane.

772
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:28,654
Did you know that a lot
of politicians and C.E.O.'s

773
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:31,721
are sociopaths?

774
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:35,654
I got another word for 'em.

775
00:41:35,655 --> 00:41:39,554
But why are you thinking
about C.E.O.'s and politicians

776
00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:40,654
and sociopaths?

777
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:43,321
Because they're smart.

778
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:45,854
They're organized. They're planners.

779
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:50,422
They don't mind playing
games with people's lives.

780
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:54,355
All the guys in this box

781
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:57,355
hate me enough to have my wife killed,

782
00:41:57,356 --> 00:42:00,388
but some of them aren't smart
enough to plan it all out.

783
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:02,654
Yeah.

784
00:42:02,655 --> 00:42:06,422
But some of them are.

785
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:14,954
You know, Walter,

786
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:18,355
when you find out which
one of 'em did it to you,

787
00:42:18,356 --> 00:42:21,522
I want you to do me a little favor.

788
00:42:21,523 --> 00:42:23,687
What's that?

789
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:26,756
I want you to hurt him.
