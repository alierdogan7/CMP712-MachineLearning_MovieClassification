Goddamn, boy!

45
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,954
Jack put two inches
of chuck on his fanny.

46
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,755
Well, lookit here.

47
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,325
Look at that.

48
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,800
Well, well, could have
taken you for a leprechaun.

00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,629
- Lookie here, Tom.
- Come on.

50
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,097
Looks like we're going
on a little treasure hunt.

51
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,633
- No, come on!
- Goddamn!

52
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,168
Here!

53
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,805
Jesus Christ! Like a bunch
of cackling hens!

54
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,209
Let's get a hinge of this here.

55
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,147
Galveston?

56
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,950
Hell, that's 60 miles
from the strike.

57
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,352
That's as far you made it?

58
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,955
Well, after all
that hell popped off

59
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,759
and I got separated from
you boys, I had to stash it.

60
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,661
I mean, my mare never would
have made it back to New Mex,

61
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,296
with 300 pounds of gold on it.

62
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,738
I mean, not with me
on it least ways.

63
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,166
Yeah, well, it didn't make
it neither way, you ninny.

64
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,103
Hell, we thought you was dead
till we heard you was sent up.

65
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,772
That's gotta be
500 miles from here.

66
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,507
Well, I wish I was dead

67
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,643
after spending six
months in that outfit!

68
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,011
Yeah!

69
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,080
I was lucky my mare
made it as far as Pecos.

70
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,549
Good you didn't give
them the drop on us, Jack.

71
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,988
And after we busted your
hocks out of the pokey,

72
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,826
the big question is,
is what's in that hard melon

73
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,495
the same as on here?

74
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,765
Identical.

75
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,433
That's my third draft.

76
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,101
I burnt the first two.

77
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,736
Damn twit!

78
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,105
(groans)

79
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,027
Whatcha kicking him
about now, huh?

80
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,743
Don't trust Jack no more?

81
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,547
Hell, it took an act of congress
to get you out of New Mex.

82
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,151
And now you're belly-aching
about 500 measly miles

83
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,752
between us and retirement?

84
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,507
Blockey: <i>We shall reap
the fruits of our journey.</i>

85
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,364
I think the big question is,

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,533
are you going with us?

87
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,473
I'm not just going.

88
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,242
I'm the one taking us there!

89
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,712
And you best not
misremember that.

90
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,715
All right.

91
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,989
(chuckles)

92
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,227
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa.

93
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,896
Whoa, look out,
look out, hey, hey.

94
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,170
Button your damn vest,
you little midget!

95
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,410
Willie: Gather
around, fine folks

96
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,846
for Woody and Willie's
Wonderful Wagon of Wares.

97
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,281
- Do the voice.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

98
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,550
What do we got today, Willie?

99
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,687
Well, Woody, we got ourselves
a special wonder potion.

100
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,723
Wonder potion?
Can it do wonders on the piles?

101
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,526
'Cause I got 'em so bad
my wood's starting to canker.

102
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,627
(laughs)

103
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,028
Well, ain't that the dickens.

104
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,431
Well, this could be
your miracle cure.

105
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,267
It's good for everything from
gout to unpleasant mouth odor.

106
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,269
Even takes out stains and such.

107
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,604
You don't say?

108
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,540
Well, maybe it can get this blue
belly blood off of my uniform.

109
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,541
(laughs)

110
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,870
It sure can.
Here, let me show you.

111
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,812
- (glass breaks)
- Oh!

112
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,380
- God!
- I... I got it.

113
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,681
Ah, yeah!

114
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,917
Would you gentlemen excuse
us for just a moment?

115
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,886
- Get in there! Get in there!
- Willie: It's fine.

116
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,822
I will show you,
you little poop dog!

117
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,290
- Willie: Ah!
- Yeah!

118
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,559
- Oh, you!
- Willie: Ow. Ow! Ow!

119
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,462
You're just a hindrance!
It's all you've ever been to me!

120
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,330
- Ow! Ow! I'm sorry!
- Oh, you're sorry?

121
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,499
I should never have taken
you out of that damn circus.

122
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,402
- Oh, I see that now.
- I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!

123
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,471
- (mocking) I didn't mean to.
- I'm sorry!

124
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,341
Ow! Ow!

125
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,644
Whoa! What, ah!

126
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,515
Stay put.

127
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,685
(grunts)

128
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,654
Knock him to
kingdom come, Mister!

129
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,689
- Don't! Please don't! No! No!
- How you like it?

130
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,257
(grunts) No! No, no, no.

131
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,726
Goddammit!
For Chrissakes, Claude!

132
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,497
We can't leave a blood
trail clear across Texas.

133
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:33,731
You hear?

134
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,901
Why not?

135
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,709
- (gunshot)
- Ah!

136
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,073
What are we gonna
do with his son?

137
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,721
Kidnap him?

138
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,423
That ain't his paw.

139
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,359
He stole him from a traveling
show to sell his wares.

140
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,003
We're a bunch of
outlaws, ain't we, Tom?

141
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,366
Might be nice to have
an innocent face with us.

142
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,922
Since mine'll be pinned up all
over God's creation soon enough.

143
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:16,040
I, I, I can throw a Bowie knife
straighter than any pistol ball.

144
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,643
Hear that?

145
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,879
Good. You're hired.

146
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,715
Boys, rustle through that wagon.

147
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,483
See if he's got any sweets.

148
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,305
Just simmer down
up there, Willie.

149
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,951
Willie: <i>High rollin'
flower farmer's got one of them</i>

150
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,753
<i>fancy motor carriages too.</i>

151
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,589
Damn telephone
in every apothecary.

152
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,426
Our way of life's in jeopardy,
boys.

153
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,662
(burps)

154
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,933
That's dandy and all, but
we ain't got a pot to piss in.

155
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:18,336
These meager fixings won't
get us past tomorrow.

156
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:19,938
Yeah.

157
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,527
Well, it's gonna take a little
green to get that gold.

158
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,943
Union Express runs
right through here.

159
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,979
Hell, the way I figure it, one
score leads to another score.

160
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,614
- Jack: Uh-huh.
- Amen.

161
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,417
(tinkling)

162
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,952
Hear that?

163
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,065
Claude! Breathe easy now!

164
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,399
Whoo, Goody!

165
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,168
Come close to ending
up in a pine box

166
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,669
sneaking up on us like that.

167
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,306
And the darkness
breeds an evil spade.

168
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,841
Put the gun down, Block.

169
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,811
Hell's bells.

170
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,606
Look like you done busted out
the wrong rascal,<i> mon ami.</i>

171
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,649
Nah, this is our tyro, Willie.

172
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,351
Slap Jack's over yonder.

173
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,585
Hey, Goody.

174
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,954
Come here and fix up some
of your goodness, huh?

175
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,190
Come on, cook us
up something good.

176
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,026
He's gonna be with
us for the duration.

177
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:19,030
Eh? Doo-ration?
We here already ain't we?

178
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,867
Yeah, well, Slap couldn't
handle the ruckus so he uh,

179
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,802
squirreled the bounty
in Galveston.

180
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,604
- Galveston?
- Claude: Uh-huh.

181
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,373
You mean we's going
all the way back?

182
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,875
Yep, at the bottom
of a well, to boot.

183
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,611
Ain't that a bad break.

184
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,785
Spit.

185
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,590
Go ahead, boy.
He just trying to fix you right.

186
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,402
Tom: The hell you been anyhow?

187
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,965
Sir, I was off scouting head

188
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,300
after I dropped y'all
boys off in the holes.

189
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,904
Come up on a pair of drovers
on they way to Junction, see?

190
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,473
Turns out they's pulpit men,

191
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,976
and they's carrying a thunder
mug of money with 'em too.

192
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,812
Some big mission over
at the Lutheran house.

193
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,382
Blockey: And yeh the Lord Provideth
in this time of drought.

194
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,718
I was brought up
Orthodox myself.

195
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,753
That's right.

196
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,954
Chapel.

197
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,458
Hell, we could take that
easy as falling off a log.

198
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,428
Junction's no slouch of a town.

199
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,565
That cussed ol' sheriff has
handled his share of highwaymen.

200
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:33,137
Tom: Yeah. We need a way
to ward off prying eyes then.

201
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,041
A diversion of sorts.

202
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,342
Claude: Exactly.

203
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,680
Might be I can help you fellers.

204
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,284
(laughs)

205
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,220
Go on, do it again! (Laughs)

206
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,688
That's funny.

207
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,925
Gather around, fine folks,
gather around!

208
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,961
Welcome to Willie and Woody's
Wonderful World of Wares.

209
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,796
Sheriff, get in here.
Come in here.

210
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,965
Today we have a
marvelous new elixir,

211
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:05,002
that is sure to get rid of all
your woes, whimpers and willies.

212
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,299
You can trust me, my son.

213
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:40,138
I, I was with my idiot
sidekick here, see?

214
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,739
And...

215
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,041
Oh, God, horrors!

216
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,011
I done seen horrors
you can't even imagine!

217
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,048
Oh, Lord! Help me!

218
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,918
I can't live with the sights
I seen today!

219
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,328
- I'm possessed!
- The Lord is with you.

220
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,097
It's a demon! It's choking me!

221
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,299
It's choking me from inside!

222
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,234
It's okay. Help me!

223
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,215
Calm yourself. Calm yourself!

224
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,784
It's all right.
My throat's parched!

225
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,786
Just breathe. Breathe.

226
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,033
Goody: Help me!

227
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,168
- Get him up.
- It's strangling...

228
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,636
Would you hold him over there?

229
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,572
(grunting)

230
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,091
(laughter)

231
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,373
Here come them
damn blue bellies.

232
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,361
And they got themselves
a Gatling gun.

233
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,283
We'll take to the trenches,
Woody.

234
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,539
Here comes the Gatling gun.

235
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,174
(firecrackers popping)

236
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,109
(grunting)

237
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,178
I'll get the man some water.

238
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,151
They're robbing us!

239
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,496
- (gunshot)
- (grunts)

240
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:46,831
(gunshots)

241
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,508
Ahh! Ah!

242
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:02,713
(gunshots)

243
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,220
(gunshot)

244
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,226
(crying)

245
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,772
(firecrackers popping)

246
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,473
Whooee! Look it there!

247
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,075
(gunshot)

248
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,644
Where the heck
did that come from?

249
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,846
Townsman: That was a shot!
Come from the church!

250
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,056
They're onto us, boys.

251
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,402
Hey!

252
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,872
- Stop!
- (gunshot)

253
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,774
I'll fill you
with a luncheon of lead!

254
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,010
(gunshots)

255
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,446
Stop!

256
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:13,718
(gunshots)

257
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,023
Come on, Peak.

258
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,530
Come on.

259
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:34,805
(horses galloping)

260
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,941
Shot away the damn loot!

261
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,710
All that for nothing?

262
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,780
Oh, God, my foot!
I think I'm bleeding out!

263
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,717
(gunshot)

264
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,286
Well, I'll be damned.

265
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,888
Lookit.

266
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,559
He made it.

267
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,795
Hot damn!

268
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,057
That was right out
of a nickel book.

269
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,500
Glad you could join us, son.

270
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,901
Where to next, boys?

271
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,073
Thank you very much.

272
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,109
Maybe a dust devil
took out the line.

273
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,911
Yeah, it was devils all right.

274
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,479
Five of them.

275
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,115
Run this to Kerrville, son.

276
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:20,084
Put it in the hands
of Sheriff Eagen.

277
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,087
Tell him to flash it
out all every which way.

278
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,589
Expect you back tomorrow
evening. Be safe.

279
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,525
Why are you
sending that boy out?

280
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,393
Why don't you do it
yourself, Sheriff?

281
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,694
(townsfolk agreeing)

282
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,631
Folks, folks, folks,
just take it easy now.

283
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,599
If I leave outta
here them rustlers

284
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,302
is liable to double back
and hit the savings bank.

285
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,740
My duty's to the safety and
well-being of this here county.

286
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,444
That's right. That's right.
To serve and protect.

287
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,679
And you got a problem with it...

288
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,850
Drop your comments in the box
outside the Sheriff's office.

289
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:54,718
Oh...

290
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,562
(coughs)

291
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,565
(grunts) (breathes heavily)

292
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,717
What did you put it in the soup?

293
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,921
Ain't nothing but a clove
or two, Mr. McDonald.

294
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,990
Just finish on up.

295
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,161
Nah, you put
something in this soup.

296
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,496
I know it!

297
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,865
Just relax, Mister.

298
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,167
Yeah.

299
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,770
I know ya put something
in it, dammit!

300
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,507
What is it, you rube? Huh?

301
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,775
Let go of my wife!

302
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:56,280
Yeah, well, you fetch
My horse right smart. Huh?

303
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,383
No need to kick none.
I'm gonna help ya.

304
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,919
Yeah, well, don't provoke me!

305
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,759
It'll all be over
in a few seconds.

306
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,030
(gunshot)

307
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:18,102
(groaning)

308
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,373
You promised me!

309
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,477
You can't just keep doing this.

310
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,878
Killing people!

311
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,781
I've had enough of
your sloppy mouth!

312
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,651
Clamp it,

313
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:36,253
before you end up next to him!

314
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,093
What about your sons?

315
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:48,232
It's no profession, Rudy.

316
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,967
There's other means.

317
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,102
Like what?

318
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,673
Send you back to whoring?

319
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,342
You couldn't turn
a nickel with that

320
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:01,111
pruned up divorced
cuzzy of yours!

321
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:02,580
(laughs)

322
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,815
I should've left you months ago.

323
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:11,355
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

324
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,693
There.

325
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,691
(body dropping)

326
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,228
Now there's your mother
to keep you company.

327
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:57,368
Now you two think
about what you've done!

328
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,209
- Papa!
- (slams cellar door)

329
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,312
Papa!

330
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,648
(slams cellar door)

331
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:16,887
(thunder rumbles)

332
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,709
Tom: Help! We've got
a hurt man out here.

333
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,778
Claude: Open up the door, Tom!

334
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,315
Hold your horses.
What's going on?

335
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,818
Boil some water up
and fetch some wraps.

336
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,086
This ain't no flophouse.

337
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,955
You can't just barge in here
like nobody's business.

338
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,425
Hot water, bandages now.

339
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,928
And some whiskey, please.

340
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,065
Right away, sir.

341
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,702
And I'll warm up some soup.

342
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,539
Get that chair.

343
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,443
(thunder rumbles)

344
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:36,300
Ah, the big fella looks like he might
need a little extra spice, huh?

345
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,837
- There you go.
- (grunts)

346
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:57,287
Haven't I seen your
picture in the paper?

347
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,125
No, sir.

348
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,327
These hills used
to be my haunts.

349
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,016
Maybe we had some
dealings before.

350
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,633
Candy will ruin your appetite.

351
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,237
Yeah, well, stench in here
ain't helping much either.

352
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,838
I'm sorry, boys.

353
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,375
Afraid I've neglected
my house duties

354
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,511
some since my wife's passing.

355
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,013
Ain't you hungry none?

356
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:25,048
All full up.

357
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:31,855
(thunder rumbles)

358
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:54,545
Thank you for bringing these
gentleman to my presence.

359
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,983
I ask that you take their hands
and welcome them

360
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,753
to their final destination.

361
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:04,354
Amen.

362
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:21,905
(gunshot)

363
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,276
- (gunshot)
- Ahh!

364
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,802
What the hell?

365
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,240
What?

366
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,745
What the hell went on here?

367
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,947
Son of a bitch.

368
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,483
The bastard hit me in the head.

369
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:11,421
I could have sworn last night
I saw him cut off Jack's...

370
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,124
(screams)

371
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,108
Body burns, same as his soul.

372
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,579
- (flashes)
- (horse neighing)

373
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:41,752
Brother Scott, did they mention
anything about where they was headed?

374
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:44,254
Well, no.

375
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,757
One goes by the name of Claude.

376
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,459
The hobbled one called him that.

377
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,694
Claude, huh?

378
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,597
What are the names of 'em
fellas stopped that

379
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,266
Houston Central car
before Christmas, Peak?

380
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,868
Nixon gang.

381
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,137
And they run with a Claude.

382
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,105
Barbee, if I'm not mistook.

383
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,608
Hey, might that be
Sweet Tooth Barbee?

384
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,643
Killed them three
fellas off that train?

385
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,605
Including that
one-armed pig farmer.

386
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:09,947
(whistles)

387
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,616
There's a pretty penny
on his hide, Sheriff.

388
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,017
You reckon it was him?

389
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,854
How many horses have
we got fit to ride?

390
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:24,194
(horses galloping)

391
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,363
Whoa.

392
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,398
Let's duck down here, fellas.

393
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,000
How do you mean?

394
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,468
We gotta keep moving.

395
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,804
We're gonna take to
the background a spell.

396
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:36,640
We got two dead preachers
wearing our bullets. Huh?

397
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,076
They're gonna have a posse
up our ass any minute now.

398
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:41,278
Yeah, and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let them

399
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,646
get a downhill pull on us.

400
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,815
Let them blasted
long arms pass us up.

401
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,683
Put some space 'twixt us.

402
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,185
Now come on.

403
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,091
Hyah!

404
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,331
Whatcha proposing now, Tom?

405
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,701
Been studying on
a change of route.

406
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,804
First daylight,
we're gonna make light tracks

407
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,726
right through the heart
of Austin.

408
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,176
Smack dab in the middle
of an army of lawdogs.

409
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,678
Clever.

410
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,434
Why don't we just dally a while,
get our picture made.

411
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,351
It's exactly what they're
not expecting us to do.

412
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:24,688
Goody: <i>Austin gots steel trees,
high as them clouds.</i>

413
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,559
Light up the town
like ten moons.

414
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:40,804
Oh, thank goodness.

415
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:42,739
Friends, do you have any water?

416
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,841
I ran out about a mile back.

417
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,763
Sure, we got a creek down
by camp.

418
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,446
- Where you headed?
- Kerrville.

419
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,748
To deliver a telegram.

420
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,052
Some bummers plundered
a church in Junction.

421
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,321
Is that right?

422
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,624
Killed two pastors.

423
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,159
(whistles)

424
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:12,836
I gathered them
fresh horses, Sheriff.

425
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,072
Looked in on
Martin's kinfolk too.

426
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,575
- Ain't seen him all week.
- Hm.

427
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:23,867
That's how come
he's on a bicycle.

428
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,585
You reckon he's run into danger?

429
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,555
Well, if it's the Nixon
gang run through here,

430
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,423
it could be a mess of it.

431
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:40,797
Oh. Oh.

432
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,033
Imagine for a minute,

433
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,536
we's the ones hauled
in them scalawags.

434
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,371
- Saved that kid.
- (gasp)

435
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:52,209
We'd be the prize of Texas.

436
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,845
Hm. Yeah.

437
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,215
Prized with the prize.

438
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,586
What are you thinking?

439
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,055
I'm thinking about that reward.

440
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,325
And Martin's
well-being, of course.

441
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:09,659
Of course.

442
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,797
Best get them horses shod
and fed before morning.

443
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,999
Yes, sir!

444
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,569
I say we take the buggy whip
to him first.

445
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:22,405
Rub him with honey

446
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:26,309
and then stake him over
that there ant bed.

447
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,145
(laughs)

448
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,781
Wait, wait! I can be bad too.
You know, like you boys.

449
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,851
(laughter)

450
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:36,853
Is that right? Is that right?

451
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,922
- Martin: I can!
- Uh-huh.

452
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,558
(Jack laughing)

453
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,727
You hear that?

454
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,098
I don't hear squat.

455
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,571
You with anyone?

456
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,632
See anything, captain?

457
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,901
Shut that puppet up.

458
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,375
War can play cruel
tricks on a man.

459
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,044
(gun clicks)

460
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,219
- Maybe you...
- (gunshot)

461
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,420
Jack: Whoo-whoo-whoo whoo!

462
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,088
You topers cork it off!

463
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,591
Before you mark every
damn one of us out here.

464
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:50,961
(chuckles)

465
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,496
Go to bed.

466
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,800
Yeah.

467
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,783
(urinating)

468
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,485
(horse neighing)

469
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,924
Shit!

470
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,027
All right, everybody up!
Martin gave us the slip!

471
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,464
Goddammit, Tom, I told you
to keep a skinned eye on him.

472
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:30,533
Tom.

473
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,770
Tom?

474
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,675
Boss? Boss?

475
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:41,978
Boss?

476
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,469
What, he got a fever
or something?

477
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,321
He dead.

478
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,794
That son of a bitch
Martin slit his throat!

479
00:34:57,963 --> 00:35:01,031
Can't be. He ain't got
a drop of blood one.

480
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,733
Ticker must have
just done stopped.

481
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:07,704
Perhaps a serpent spit
venom upon his bread.

482
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,840
A wicked ebony serpent.

483
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:15,312
Or a fatherless tramp
with a hand puppet!

484
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,513
Hey!

485
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:17,681
Now,
I ain't had no count killing.

486
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:21,318
Everybody just hush up!
Nobody kill nobody. All right?

487
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:24,554
Tom wasn't exactly no spring
chicken by any stretch.

488
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,390
He just came to the end
of his trail, that's all.

489
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,427
Should I get to
digging a grave, Claude?

490
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:34,197
Nah, we ain't got no
time for no ceremony.

491
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,267
No telling how long that
courier's been on foot.

492
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:41,705
You boys gather the horses.
I'll say a few words over him.

493
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,408
Get on the scout, Goody.

494
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,945
And drag Tom by the creek.

495
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,215
Goody:<i> All right, boss.</i>

496
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:01,257
Well, fix it! Goddog it, fix it!

497
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:06,696
All right, gentlemen,
Martin is gone missing.

498
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,866
The damn cable's
still on the fritz.

499
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:13,303
We have reason to believe the
Nixon gang blew through here.

500
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,338
Hear tell they killed 60 men.

501
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,540
I ain't counting pepper
bellies and half-breeds!

502
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,876
Yeah, that's why
we're here today

503
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,512
putting it to you
boys to volunteer.

504
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,181
Now, get deputized
and stand in with us.

505
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,617
Volunteer? To go belly up?

506
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,652
Hogwash!

507
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,623
Volunteer to hunt down
them back-shooting bastards.

508
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,427
Put your name
in the mouths of all men.

509
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:40,130
Get a little richer
in the process.

510
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,433
Any takers?

511
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,502
We'll go, sir.

512
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,838
That's what I want to hear.

513
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,209
I'm gonna hang a story on them so
we can hole up here for the night.

514
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,780
I don't want any ruckus,
<i>comprende?</i>

515
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,783
Oh, whoa, whoa, what was that?

516
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,420
(tinkling)

517
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,788
You hear that?

518
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:09,159
(tinkling)

519
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:12,862
Bang, bang, bang,
bang! Bang, bang, bang!

520
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,631
You got me there, buddy.

521
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,100
Denton!

522
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,902
Denton.

523
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,537
Denton, come here this instant.

524
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,508
Sorry.
He's been cooped up all day.

525
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,111
That's all right.

526
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,880
When the cats are away,
the mice do play.

527
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,451
Speaking of, maw and paw around?

528
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,956
William: You say you
gentlemen are cattle traders?

529
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,291
Claude: Yes, sir.

530
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,126
Been working stock out west.

531
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,895
Oh, yes, we've been moving
east for a few days now.

532
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:49,132
Mm. Pardon my excessive queries.

533
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:52,735
It's just we've been on edge
since we got wind of a few

534
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,840
unsavories in the area.

535
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,576
They answer well
to your appearance.

536
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,944
Claude: Is that right?

537
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,679
Held up a Lutheran church.

538
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,982
Executed the entire parish.

539
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,518
Imagine that.

540
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:14,224
(coughs)

541
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,759
Ladies and gentlemen!

542
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,762
Performing tonight,
my sister Mary.

543
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,700
The bestest songstress
in all of Texas.

544
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:28,171
And yours truly, Denton
Wilberforce, tickling the ivories.

545
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:31,374
Children, no recital tonight.

546
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,710
These men are jaded.

547
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,312
Well, that's all right.

548
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,981
Been under whip and spur so long

549
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,383
be nice to mix it up with
a bit of a spectacle.

550
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,218
Go ahead.

551
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:52,629
<i>♪ The eyes of Texas
are upon us ♪</i>

552
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,966

559
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,729
(whistling and clapping)

560
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,131
Beautiful.

561
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,400
Beautiful.

562
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:31,801
Claude: Very nice.

563
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,303
Very nice.

564
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:48,151
(tinkling)

565
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,620
Denton?

566
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,512
(urinating)

567
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,550
(tinkling)

568
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,518
Denton?

569
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,027
(gasps)

570
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,363
(screams)

571
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:38,134
(outhouse door shaking)

572
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:44,007
- (fabric ripping)
- (Blockey grunting)

573
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,916
Got my mama's jewelry box too,
but she's got the key.

574
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,820
Break that open,
enough in there to probably

575
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,690
pay you back plus some.

576
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,192
Well, you know you're hard
workers and I appreciate that

577
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,994
and it's the least we can do.

578
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,397
Claude: That might
just work out fine.

579
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:13,236
(humming)

580
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,338
(gasps)

581
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,874
(Elizabeth screaming)

582
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,876
- (Elizabeth crying)
- Did you hear that?

583
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:23,780
(crying)

584
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,848
William!

585
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,519
- William!
- Elizabeth?

586
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,459
(crying) It's Mary!
She's been murdered!

587
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,628
Where? What happened?

588
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,030
They shoved her
in the necessary like

589
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,266
she was yesterday's refuse!

590
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,204
(crying) Our Mary!

591
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,309
You gone absolutely mad?

592
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,712
You're weeding a row
straight to the bone orchard!

593
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:59,015
What's wrong with you? What's
going on in that head of yours?

594
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,057
You can't keep
doing this kind of stuff.

595
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,854
- Denton: Okay, Pa.
- We ain't never gonna make it

596
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,322
to the coast, you keep
doing this kinda crazy...

597
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,623
Step aside, Mister!

598
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,393
Now!

599
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:14,230
I don't know who you people are,

600
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,900
but I sensed you were bad company
the moment I laid eyes on you.

601
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:23,473
The good Lord says not to
judge folks without warrant.

602
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,609
And I follow that word.

603
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,180
Plain fact is

604
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:36,018
the whole lot of you is just
dregs on your way to perdition.

605
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,590
So I may as well just
do the unchristian thing

606
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,693
and help you along.

607
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,129
Starting with you.

608
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,198
- (gunshot)
- No!

609
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,267
William!

610
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,539
Denton!

611
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,776
(gunshot)

612
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:02,111
She's turning tail, Claude!

613
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,646
That's all right. Let her go.

614
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:07,183
There ain't no need to
separate a boy from his maw.

615
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,140
Now let's saddle
up those horses.

616
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,322
Dammit.

617
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,364
(horse neighing)

618
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,368
Oh!

619
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,506
Claude!

620
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,076
You might wanna see this!

621
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:57,233
What kind of animal done that?

622
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,572
The kind that walks on two legs.

623
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,209
All right,
let's skedaddle, boys.

624
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:08,010
- Still got the map.
- Hey.

625
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,746
What about the ankle biter?

626
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,245
She'll be back
for him soon enough.

627
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,921
Saddle me up one of his horses.

628
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,057
Let's get the hell out of here.

629
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,425
Come on.

630
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,110
Check the brush line.

631
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,246
Watch for any movement.

632
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:45,414
My foot's torn to bits.

633
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:48,484
This just ain't right for
a man in my condition.

634
00:44:48,486 --> 00:44:50,419
Keep riding, Slap.

635
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,123
Keep your eyes peeled.

636
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,325
Whoa.

637
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,330
Hell, I reckon it
was an Injun, boys.

638
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:05,301
Probably skipped the reservation,
like old Black Horse back in '76.

639
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,770
Oh, I don't know.

640
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:10,072
Oklahoma's an awful
long way to come

641
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,941
just to put tail on us.

642
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:14,610
A ghoulish raven
doth haunt our crusade.

643
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:18,748
'Sides, ain't no Injun gonna hack
up a easy $50 just like that.

644
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,350
Huh?

645
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,852
Hell.

646
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,788
There's only one way to play
hide and seek with a buck.

647
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,357
Let's draw him outta the bush.

648
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:32,929
Ready to go to the Lacy to
get your banana peeled, boy?

649
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,431
Really?

650
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,166
Oh! Hot damn!

651
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,268
I never pickled a girl before.

652
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,271
I shalt not darken
the door of a den of sin.

653
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:46,208
Well, hallelujah, Block!
You can be the rubberneck, then.

654
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,864
All right, let's duck
back in here. Come on.

655
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,646
(laughs)

656
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,852
Denton!

657
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,689
I don't see him anywhere.

658
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,091
Birds done flown, Sheriff.

659
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,993
No sign of the boy, neither.

660
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,355
How many of them
were there, ma'am?

661
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,131
There were four.

662
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,734
One was badly wounded.

663
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:15,571
The bearded one
took my Mary away.

664
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,242
They claimed they
were cattlemen.

665
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:26,682
One had a... Had pistols
with ivory handles.

666
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,651
That sounds like
Barbee's hardware.

667
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:30,733
I know for a fact,
he carries two pearls.

668
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:34,090
I know it's hard, ma'am.

669
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,227
But can you remember
anything else?

670
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:42,365
The lame one was outspoken.

671
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:45,768
He mentioned they were
headed to the coast.

672
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,937
Thank you, ma'am.

673
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,572
We'll find them.

674
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:53,189
You might want to
check out front, Sheriff.

675
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,245
Come on, let's go.

676
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,915
(Elizabeth crying)

677
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,284
(organ playing)

678
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:05,521
(people chattering)

679
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,302
Get back to whoring
and make me some money.

680
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,271
Go on, git!

681
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,474
(organ playing)

682
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:28,544
(people chattering)

683
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,893
(groans)

684
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,779
All right.
Where's the cash, fat snacks?

685
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,028
Stop those scoundrels!
They robbed me!

686
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:23,833
Out of my way!

687
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,203
Son of bitches!

688
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:28,971
Ow! (Groans)

689
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:36,378
Hey!

690
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,215
- Move back.
- Townsman: Go get them, Sheriff!

691
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,729
(grunts)

692
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,170
- (Jack laughs)
- Good job, Willie.

693
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,706
(laughs)

694
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:14,884
This is the devil's work.

695
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,753
Can't have no part.

696
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,890
We'll kindly commiserate
with Mrs. Wilberforce,

697
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:24,693
return to the mission,
summon a coroner.

698
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,249
Sheriff, I don't know what
part of hell they're from.

699
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:29,431
So sorry we disappointed you.

700
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,205
Come on, Peak.

701
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:45,080
(coughs)

702
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,951
(coughs)

703
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,267
(gunshot)

704
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,309
What a dodge!

705
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,744
It was just like one
them Sam Bass yarns.

706
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,981
I tell you what, sure's been
crackerjack riding with you fellers.

707
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:21,650
That ain't dishwater, but that ain't
gonna get us to the coast now either.

708
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:22,952
Willie: Ah-hah!

709
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,267
Claude: Good outlaw
never stays satisfied.

710
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,090
Goody: 'Bout time you
loafers done showed up!

711
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,228
Ran into a bit of a
hitch over at K-town.

712
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,164
Keep your eyes on a fix.
Might have a shadow or two.

713
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:42,183
Goody: You know, they was a whole lot
of chatter in my ears too, boss.

714
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:45,674
I reckon you's getting more
popular by the day, monsieur.

715
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,810
(chuckles)

716
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,349
You ever wonder
what'd it'd be like to

717
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:55,684
buckle down on some
hard work, Jack?

718
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:00,990
I ain't talking
about petty thieving.

719
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:03,792
Talking about an honest trade.

720
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:07,363
Hell, maybe even
marry a starry belle.

721
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,132
No!

722
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:12,534
Would you play checkers
with your nose?

723
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,973
Yeah.

724
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:19,842
Guess you're right.

725
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,845
(tinkling)

726
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:24,613
You hear that?

727
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:25,881
Same noise.

728
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,986
(gunshots)

729
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,889
Don't shoot! I'm unarmed!

730
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,460
Come out with your
hands high, then!

731
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,041
You.

732
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:54,410
Me.

733
00:51:56,414 --> 00:51:58,847
Willie, grab her horse.

734
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,592
How long you been trailing us?

735
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,997
Since you stirred up
that fracas at the Lacy.

736
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:19,435
Bastard Bud's been due for
a dust-up for a long time now.

737
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:23,939
Kinda nice seeing somebody
nervy enough to stand up to him.

738
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,342
Is that right?

739
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:29,378
And then it got me to thinking.

740
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,717
All those years whoring for Bud and
I got nothing but a curious itch.

741
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,086
(chuckles)

742
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:40,723
So, I started studying
a new line of work.

743
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:46,261
Outlawing ain't no
place for a woman.

744
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,698
Well, let me be blunt.

745
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:53,602
You see, I got things
you boys are lacking.

746
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:57,473
Things that can be
mighty distracting.

747
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,144
Call me Pearl.

748
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,950
Though he was
chained hand and foot

749
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:13,055
and kept under guard,
he'd broken his chains.

750
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:17,960
And been driven by the demon
into the darkness.

751
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,162
Jack: That's deep.

752
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:22,464
Lucky that bell
didn't land you dead.

753
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,300
That sound's making me
a bit tetchy of late.

754
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,406
- Hey!
- Don't mind him none.

755
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,641
He's just checking your mojo.

756
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,177
What's wrong, son?

757
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,581
Get some winks.

758
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:41,517
I can't.

759
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:44,186
Not after your horse got
all diced up like that.

760
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,455
Then you be the nighthawk then.

761
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,958
You get tired,
let Blockey relieve you.

762
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,160
Now, go on.

763
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:57,966
Cut up your horse? Mercy me.

764
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,536
You sure do have a knack for
finding trouble, don't you?

765
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:04,006
Yeah, well, purty
good at finding me too.

766
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:06,341
Besides, Injun done that.

767
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:11,113
Never met one that liked
a pale face anyhow.

768
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,785
But I bet they'd fancy
a little desert flower like you.

769
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,489
Not too hard on the eyes if
you don't mind me saying.

770
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,392
You're not too bad yourself.

771
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:25,227
A little rough around the edges,

772
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:28,230
but nothing a fine lady
couldn't smooth out.

773
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,833
If you don't mind me saying.

774
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:32,301
Not too bad, huh?

775
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,969
That's a start.

776
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:38,841
So what's a sharp-wit like you running
around with rabble like this?

777
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,044
Doesn't make a lick of sense.

778
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:45,681
Hell, makes a lot of sense
if you're in a pinch.

779
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,817
These chaps here can sling
lead with the best of 'em.

780
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,353
Pew, pew, pew. (Laughs)

781
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:55,491
Claude: Might not be much on words,
but that's what my momma's for.

782
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:58,994
Smallpox took mine.

783
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:01,897
But I was just a girl.

784
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,565
Yeah?

785
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,004
Mine's barely grown when
she had me and my twin brother.

786
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:15,744
Got a little weary of
our hell raising, sent us off,

787
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,047
and I haven't seen her
since I was a spud.

788
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,486
That's why I got these though.

789
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,188
Keep her close.

790
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:27,951
They're gorgeous.

791
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:34,196
South Sea pearls
from the Outback.

792
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,700
Daddy stole them off
a Mexican in Matamoros.

793
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,403
Made my momma a fine gift too.

794
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:46,074
Hell, I could buy 400
head of beef with these.

795
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:49,444
Memory's worth more
than gold to me though.

796
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:52,714
They're so extravagant.

797
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,883
May I hold 'em?

798
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:05,394
Let's call it a night.

799
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,043
(growling)

800
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:56,812
(breathes heavily)

801
00:56:57,748 --> 00:56:59,214
Pearl: Hm?

802
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,159
Goddamnit.

803
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,961
All right, everybody up!

804
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,830
Tyro fell asleep.

805
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,699
Let's get in the cups, boys.

806
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:19,589
See what this day brings.

807
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,307
See if Miss Pearl's
worth her salt.

808
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:30,412
Well, let me just go freshen up.

809
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,219
I don't trust her, boss.

810
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,555
I seen her juju.

811
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,492
Hush up, Goody.

812
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,595
I'm about tired of
your flapdoodle this week.

813
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:52,934
I never seen nothing like it.

814
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:58,273
Eyes black as pitch hands
faster than two rattlesnakes.

815
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:01,143
He worked them two
pearly-handled sixers

816
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:04,012
faster than the eye could see.
I don't mind telling you.

817
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:08,750
Grabs two handfuls of candy
and hightails it out of there.

818
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:11,720
Come the law.

819
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,923
What's all the hubbub?

820
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,260
Sweet Tooth Barbee, that's what.

821
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,063
Where can we have a word
with the Sheriff?

822
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,232
Right over there.

823
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:27,669
Don't know how much you'll
get out of him, though.

824
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,371
Seeing as he's dead.

825
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:32,207
Sorry to hear it.

826
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,410
Well, you'd better speak
up if he's gonna hear it.

827
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,914
(train horn)

828
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,115
(whistle)

829
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:43,418
Ooh, well, well.

830
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:45,654
What have we got here?

831
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,490
Nice work, Pearl.

832
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,227
All right, Jimmy,
where's the money at?

833
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,663
No, no, sir. I got nothing.

834
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:56,832
I going to sell these
furs on the market.

835
00:58:56,834 --> 00:59:00,001
And if you catch me on the back
way, maybe I had me some notes.

836
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,670
But luck would have it,

837
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:03,939
I'm broker than a old
mangy heel hound.

838
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,709
Fact, all I got to my name
is this here 50-cent piece.

839
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:10,145
- Goddamn, nothing but pelts!
- (gunshot)

840
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,848
Ain't that the trots?

841
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,350
Son of a bitch!

842
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,253
Get a rope!

843
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:21,123
Strip 'em. Goddamn!

844
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,259
Get his boots up in the tree.

845
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,128
Come on.

846
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:34,669
(door knocking)

847
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:44,246
I'm just checking to see if you
folks have settled for the night.

848
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,681
Need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

849
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:50,452
Oh, and by the way, don't
forget to lock your doors.

850
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:52,821
There's been talks of Sweet
Tooth Barbee in the region.

851
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:55,290
- Who's that?
- Oh, you don't know?

852
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:57,492
Well, cable says he's
only the biggest gun

853
00:59:57,494 --> 00:59:59,694
to hit the area
since Bass himself.

854
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,498
Says you'll know him by his spiffy
getup and penchant for taffy.

855
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,600
Watch out though,

856
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,804
people say he's got thin
skin and a hair trigger.

857
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,806
They also say he smells of curry

858
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:14,342
and has these abnormally,
almost baby-like digits.

859
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:17,245
He carries these two rose carved

860
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,850
pearly-handled, uh, shooters.

861
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:28,156
(door shutting)

862
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:32,814
Hey, you might as well
get comfortable, boy.

863
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,931
(groans)

864
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,068
- Had to do it.
- Shh.

865
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,039
Whatcha got?

866
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,342
Two lawmen just checked in,
looking for you.

867
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,743
Is that right?

868
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,679
Think they might be onto us?

869
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:52,761
No, but I think you
should warn the others.

870
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:55,016
Yeah.

871
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,718
Now you thinking like an outlaw.

872
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:03,425
Size coat you wear, son?

873
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:18,974
We done told you,
we don't need no damn...

874
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,710
Claude?

875
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:24,746
Sweet Mary on a pickle!

876
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,648
Anybody need their
boots spit shined?

877
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:27,749
Ow!

878
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,551
All right, enough of
the grab assin', boys.

879
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:30,852
Now listen up.

880
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,888
We got a couple
badges checked in.

881
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,757
We hit the saddle at five
before they open their lids.

882
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:36,958
Comprende?

883
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:39,628
- Si.
- All right, now goodnight.

884
01:01:41,665 --> 01:01:43,064
All right.

885
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:46,801
(clears throat)

886
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:52,407
Porter, couple of
coffees,<i> por favor.</i> Black.

887
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:54,609
Right away, sir.

888
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:59,581
Peak: <i>Barbee's no different than
any other blow hard out there.</i>

889
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,449
<i>More blow than hard.</i>

890
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:04,853
<i>Fellas think they're hot snot.
Ain't nothin' but cold...</i>

891
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:15,830
(giggles)<i> I'm sorry,</i>
<i>it's just, Sweet Tooth?</i>

892
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,767
Not very intimidating
for a road agent.

893
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:20,835
No, it's not.

894
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:24,606
I spent all these years trying
to make a name for myself,

895
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:27,175
and then they go make
a mockery out of me like that.

896
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,480
Should be something
like Claudacious Barbee.

897
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,883
It's got a ring to it, right?

898
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,117
Oh...

899
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,153
Don't pull a long face.

900
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:42,624
Takes a lot of bark to throw aside
caution in a scrape like that.

901
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,660
The way you handled
that Sheriff.

902
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,396
- Yeah?
- Mm.

903
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:50,765
I was pretty sneaky, wasn't I?

904
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,701
Mm-hm. (Chuckles)

905
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,840
But that ain't gonna
get us to the coast.

906
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:02,210
What's at the coast?

907
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:08,083
(chuckles) Is it
legal or illegal?

908
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:12,821
Oh, it's legal.

909
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:15,790
Legal tender.

910
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,258
(groans)

911
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:22,764
Not that it's any of my affair
but uh, just how legal?

912
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,571
King's ransom legal.

913
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,777
The gang know?

914
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,346
Yeah, they know.

915
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:42,117
But I got the map.

916
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,184
Hm.

917
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:14,315
(moaning)

918
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,557
Oh, Sweet Tooth!

919
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:30,131
Come on!

920
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,480
Left a little love note.

921
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:47,248
Heeyah!

922
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,939
What in the hell is that?

923
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,007
(DJ groans)

924
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,615
Mm. Mm-mm.

925
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,053
I've been tied up all night.

926
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:26,988
And Sweet Tooth
took my clothes and...

927
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,990
Well, he ran off with
your pocketbooks.

928
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,795
Dog-eating, scum-sucking
son of a bitch!

929
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,165
Dammit, Peak! Let's
get out of here.

930
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,707
DJ: I've seen things tonight that a
man wouldn't do to a farm animal.

931
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:47,342
♪ (western music) ♪

932
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,669
Whoo-ee!

933
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:25,206
I sure can't wait to weigh my pockets
down with them riches, Claude.

934
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,108
(laughs)

935
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:29,611
Oh, I'm getting
my foot patched up,

936
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:33,881
get me a new finger
and a couple of grade A whores.

937
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,850
(laughing)

938
01:07:36,286 --> 01:07:38,720
Fill the measure of my pleasure

939
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:41,422
with some whiskey
and women, boys!

940
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,592
Be happier than a pig in shit!

941
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:47,462
(laughs) Whoo!

942
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:50,598
How about you, Block?

943
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:57,772
I'll walk with Claude
till I'm called home.

944
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:02,644
All right.

945
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:04,412
Okay.

946
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,180
(tinkling)

947
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:07,882
Quiet.

948
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:09,217
(tinkling)

949
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:10,385
Hear that?

950
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:15,356
(tinkling)

951
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:27,835
You after the bounty?

952
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:34,042
Show your feathers
you brave bastard, come on!

953
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:39,447
It's probably just
a lost heifer, Claude.

954
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,150
I got a toy, too! Listen up!

955
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:45,720
(gunshots)

956
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:52,093
Claude,

957
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:55,430
We'll flush 'em out
in the morning.

958
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,434
He ain't done us no harm.

959
01:09:01,004 --> 01:09:03,104
Yeah, well, I aim
to keep it that way.

960
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,707
I'm on perch tonight, boys.

961
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:15,116
(horse neighing)

962
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:24,058
(grunts) Son of a bitch!

963
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:26,327
All right, everybody up!
Let's go, boys.

964
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,796
We got a map stealing
cunt ahead of us now.

965
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,733
Willie, up!

966
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,838
Jesus Christ.

967
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,939
Damn.

968
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,744
I's told you that
woman had wormy mojo.

969
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:44,879
But you ain't wanna listen.

970
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,882
Now lookit. She done
took and killed Willie.

971
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:52,153
Strumpet's as crooked
as the path to Hell.

972
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:54,155
Now listen.

973
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:56,190
Now, Pearl might be
a leg-spreading thief.

974
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,226
But she sure as hell
ain't no murderer.

975
01:09:58,228 --> 01:10:00,328
This here's the handiwork
of a renegade red-ass

976
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,929
gone madder than a coot.

977
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,900
Jack ain't looking
too good, boss.

978
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:08,236
He green as a cucumber

979
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,738
and he smelling like
yesterday's milk.

980
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:16,644
What? Like hell.

981
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,312
Like hell I am.

982
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:20,848
All right, Goody,
make a round around the camp.

983
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,117
Curry-comb every niche,
every hollow.

984
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:25,420
I want you try to pick
up that bastard's trail.

985
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:26,754
Block, stay here.

986
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:29,056
Do not leave Jack. Got it?

987
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,659
I'm gonna run in to La Grange,
try to find a sawbones,

988
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:34,262
I expect Willie planted
before I get back now.

989
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,106
Hyah! Hyah!

990
01:10:57,954 --> 01:10:59,620
Whoa.

991
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:02,223
A mighty big rattler done that.

992
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:06,761
You might feel
something down here.

993
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,397
(screaming) God!

994
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:14,702
(groaning)

995
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:22,977
Claude: <i>Come on, Slap.
You're all right.</i>

996
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,179
(groaning and crying)

997
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:27,648
With this heat, gangrene's
gonna set right in quick.

998
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,385
Now, I recommend he stays off
that foot for at least a week.

999
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,087
Now, I don't know
what transacted...

1000
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,049
Week's too long.
What else you got?

1001
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:39,093
I could amputate.

1002
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:40,761
That will work.

1003
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,363
- (Jack groaning)
- Shh.

1004
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,498
All right then.

1005
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,086
- Claude: Settle down, Slap.
- No!

1006
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:48,269
You ain't loppin' off
my damn tootsie! No!

1007
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:51,572
We gotta get a move on.
Hound's almost had us treed.

1008
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:53,741
Rogue Indian took
out little Willie.

1009
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,510
Every minute we burn,

1010
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:57,378
that whore's getting
further and further from us.

1011
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,680
But we, I can't!

1012
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:03,351
Come on. I like to kick a hawg
every now and then.

1013
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:04,852
You know that, Claude. Please!

1014
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:07,522
You kick you all the hawgs
you want we get there.

1015
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:10,725
I don't give a cuss. Hell,
I'll even buy you a peg leg.

1016
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:14,862
This outlawing's gone
to your damn head, Claude!

1017
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:17,598
You're all about
the greenbacks now.

1018
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,801
Ain't that right,
Mr. Sweet Tooth, huh?

1019
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:23,871
There wouldn't even be any green
if I didn't bust your keester

1020
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:25,239
out of prison, now would there?

1021
01:12:25,241 --> 01:12:28,976
And you wouldn't have the goddamn
map if you left me in prison, huh?

1022
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,245
I don't have the map, Slap!

1023
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,215
That's why we gotta
cut your darn foot off!

1024
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:41,289
(chuckles)

1025
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,259
Told you you ain't
cutting off my foot.

1026
01:12:45,261 --> 01:12:46,627
(grunts)

1027
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:51,332
Man: <i>Much obliged.
You got a right nice town here.</i>

1028
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,136
Got that grain, Sheriff.

1029
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:58,606
Oughta get us at least through the
next couple, two, three days.

1030
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,907
Good work, Peak.

1031
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,410
So what now?

1032
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:07,515
- Dr. Pepperdine, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1033
01:13:09,018 --> 01:13:11,118
Please excuse
my appearance, fine folk.

1034
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:14,689
I was hornswoggled by
a group of stickup men.

1035
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:16,757
They were pretending
to be marshals.

1036
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,659
You catch any names, Doc?

1037
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,094
Yes, I did.

1038
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:23,664
One of them went
by the name of Claude.

1039
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,267
Caught that during
an argument over a map.

1040
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,157
Before they had
their way with me.

1041
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,106
Peak:
He's on the outskirts, Sheriff.

1042
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:33,574
Dr. Pepperdine:
Took my dang shoes.

1043
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,109
Townsman: That's Sweet Tooth.

1044
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:36,444
All right, folks.

1045
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:39,647
Doc here just had a run
in with the Barbee gang.

1046
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:43,184
They've given us fits now for
the better part of a week.

1047
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:47,622
They're wanted for a string of
heinous offences, statewide.

1048
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:49,390
We act fast though,

1049
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,826
we've got a good shot
at hunting them down.

1050
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,795
We're offering a share
of the reward.

1051
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:59,634
Plus a $100 to any man
who'll join up with us

1052
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,402
and bring him to justice.

1053
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:04,839
Come on, step up now.
Don't be shy.

1054
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:08,342
I'm no hunter, Sheriff,

1055
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:11,245
but I do have a little secret
might be worth sharing.

1056
01:14:12,315 --> 01:14:14,048
You can call me Ruby.

1057
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:17,151
(laughs) No!

1058
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:20,221
Get your hands off of me!

1059
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,425
I'll be damned.

1060
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:26,794
We got him.

1061
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,996
Ain't no chieftain
after all, boys.

1062
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:32,727
Well, I ain't got
time for this shit.

1063
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,929
Blockey, how about
a Texas slinger?

1064
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,708
- No!
- (laughs)

1065
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:45,513
(screaming)

1066
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:48,115
- Get off of me...
- The Lord shall judge the quick

1067
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:51,652
and the dead.

1068
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,955
- (crying)
- (laughs)

1069
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,257
(gunshot)

1070
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:03,030
- Jack: <i>Whoo-hoo!</i>
- Claude:<i> Yeah!</i>

1071
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:04,198
Jack:<i> Menudo.</i>

1072
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,134
- Whoo-hoo!
- Good shot.

1073
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:10,538
(coughs)

1074
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:22,883
Barbee, Diente Dulce.

1075
01:15:23,486 --> 01:15:26,654
Damn, that sounds
pretty good in Mexicano.

1076
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:29,056
Got a bit of a ring to it.

1077
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,125
<i>Qué es nombre?</i>

1078
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,461
Ricardo Diaz.

1079
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,896
De Rio Rico.

1080
01:15:38,835 --> 01:15:40,267
Nah, don't ring a bell.

1081
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,905
Good knowing you, Dick.
This is for Willie.

1082
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,274
Good night.

1083
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:48,943
(gunshot)

1084
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,682
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1085
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:56,764
All right, let's push
on through the night.

1086
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,353
Nab 'em before
they ever get to Galveston.

1087
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:03,057
Reckon she's just blowing
smoke up our petunias, Sheriff?

1088
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,627
Ruby? Nah. She's
real as a rabbi.

1089
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:11,098
I wouldn't put it past old Barbee
sending a pretty gal to slip us up.

1090
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,001
She's after a share of that
reward same as you and me.

1091
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,538
They could be halfway
to Laredo by now.

1092
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:20,941
I suspect they're after a pile
of that rail job booty

1093
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:22,510
they botched in Houston.

1094
01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:24,445
If I was a bandit,

1095
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:28,182
this here stretch of seclusion
would be my sunset route.

1096
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:31,352
Come on, let's go. Come on.

1097
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,726
Oh, shitfire!

1098
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:41,262
Why can't we ever ambush
some damn Italians?

1099
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,224
Get me some of that
tortellini, huh?

1100
01:16:44,634 --> 01:16:46,133
Say, boss?

1101
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,535
Yeah.

1102
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:50,204
You sure that pepper
the one pulled Willie's plug?

1103
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:53,874
Hell yeah, I'm sure.

1104
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,410
Had a whole family of scalps.

1105
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:59,713
One of them just as straight
and black as Willie's locks.

1106
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,352
Well, I ain't taking no chances.

1107
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,321
Mm-mm. No.

1108
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:10,191
I'm laying right here
next to this damn fire

1109
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,328
so I can see any son of
a bitch come to call.

1110
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:17,364
Click. (Laughs)

1111
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,834
You do that 'cause
you on call tonight.

1112
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:22,069
(coughs)

1113
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:24,438
What's in that stuff, Goody?

1114
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,673
Jack: Damn.

1115
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,015
Goody: Nothing fancy
over here,<i> mon ami.</i>

1116
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:37,852
Claude!

1117
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:41,755
(screaming and panting)

1118
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:43,791
Holy Christmas.

1119
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:54,668
Even the looniest
shithouse bounty

1120
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,710
wouldn't do something
like this, Claude.

1121
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,373
No.

1122
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:01,442
He ain't after no reward.

1123
01:18:02,478 --> 01:18:05,913
This is someone with some
serious mental shocks.

1124
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:08,482
It might not even
be a humankind.

1125
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:11,652
Blockey: <i>Terror bestows
those who embrace evil.</i>

1126
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:16,257
Maybe we should call it tits up
and head back to New Mexico.

1127
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,260
I'll rather be in prison
than Hell.

1128
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,594
Not a chance!

1129
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:23,956
We're riding like hellfire till we hear
those waves breaking on the shore.

1130
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,901
If this man, animal,
demon, whatever he is,

1131
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:28,863
he wants to go with us,
that's fine.

1132
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:30,771
No skin off my back!

1133
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,774
He'll have to wash out each
one of us before I'm left.

1134
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,176
You hear that?

1135
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:39,947
I'm calling you out!

1136
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:47,021
It'll be a cold day in hell before
you back down the Barbee gang!

1137
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:52,826
(gunshots)

1138
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:55,296
(screams)

1139
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:08,896
The beans are still
warm, Sheriff.

1140
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,477
We're getting' closer.

1141
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:14,615
Ain't gonna be much
to get close to.

1142
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:17,785
There's that circular
mark again.

1143
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,721
What you make of it?

1144
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:23,324
Don't.

1145
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:27,294
Seems to favor the dead though.

1146
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:31,231
Let's hope it ain't contagious.

1147
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:40,140
Jack: <i>That old plug's
nearly broke, Claude.</i>

1148
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:44,145
<i>It's never gonna make it.</i>

1149
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,479
Claude: <i>Hell, Pearl must be at
least 15 miles ahead of us by now.</i>

1150
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,081
We'll double up if we got to.

1151
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,470
We'll be covering 'em foot loose if
we don't water these horses here.

1152
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:52,626
I mean, look at your mare.
She's spent.

1153
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:55,055
Dammit.

1154
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,498
All right, we'll camp
in this field then.

1155
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:00,194
No fire! Not tonight.

1156
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:06,934
And when I return, my stench
will rise in these fields.

1157
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,103
Amen.

1158
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,505
Don't go too far, Block.

1159
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:16,877
Hey, Jack.

1160
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,212
Yeah?

1161
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:21,915
You ever think maybe God's
playing some cruel joke on us?

1162
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:25,586
- How do you mean?
- Hell...

1163
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:28,756
It seems like such a tangle.

1164
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:32,559
Take good time to
fashion each one of us.

1165
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,728
Drop us off down here
on this world.

1166
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:38,032
Just to bob around
year after year.

1167
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:43,270
Collecting, wealth,
whiskey, women.

1168
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:49,276
Then He makes some mad hatter
pick us off one by one.

1169
01:20:50,713 --> 01:20:55,983
Sticks us out in the middle of this
wheat field, cold, hungry, betrayed.

1170
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,088
Just seems a little
sick, that's all.

1171
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:07,494
Well, what if
God didn't make it?

1172
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:14,968
<i>You plugged up?</i>

1173
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:18,405
Blockey: Claude!

1174
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:20,240
Ah, hell.

1175
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:22,743
I gotta go check on him.
Stay right here.

1176
01:21:22,745 --> 01:21:25,312
- Don't move!
- Ah. (Groans)

1177
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:30,951
Block!

1178
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:46,366
(tinkling)

1179
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,335
(gunshots)

1180
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:50,637
Who are you?

1181
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:55,709
You after that reward!

1182
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:59,012
Come and get it,
you son of a bitch!

1183
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:02,015
(gunshots)

1184
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,889
(gunshots)

1185
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:11,191
Wha...

1186
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,313
(gunshots)
How many are you, huh?

1187
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:16,864
(gunshots)

1188
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:19,967
Get down! Yeah! Huh, get down!

1189
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:21,769
- What is it?
- Back to back!

1190
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:23,437
Ah, we didn't shake him.
He's still out there.

1191
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,639
What was it? Where's Block? Huh?

1192
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:28,709
I didn't see him. Darker than
a well digger's ass out there.

1193
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:31,044
Come on, grab your iron!

1194
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:34,047
Anything moves but the grass,
you plug it in the gullet now.

1195
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:38,252
- Sweet Jesus!
- Ah, just relax, Slap. Come on.

1196
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:58,438
Only man I ever rode with that was
as cool and unmoved as the trees.

1197
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:03,777
Sorry, Block.

1198
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:09,449
Goddamn lunatic did this to you.

1199
01:23:12,555 --> 01:23:14,354
You take care of him in hell.

1200
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,990
'Cause I'm gonna send him
there right behind you.

1201
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,564
(gunshots)

1202
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:25,265
(grunts)

1203
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,468
- Hotfoot it, Claude!
- (gunshot)

1204
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:29,836
I got you covered!

1205
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:34,274
(gunshots)

1206
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:41,081
(horse neighs)

1207
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:44,618
- What...
- Let's go! Come on!

1208
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:46,486
(gunshots)

1209
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:51,458
Hyah.

1210
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,996
Hyah!

1211
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:58,932
Come on! Hyah!
Come on, Cherry. Come on.

1212
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:01,134
Hyah! Hyah! Let's go!

1213
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,572
Come and get us!

1214
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,408
(gunshots)

1215
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:12,947
- Halt!
- (gunshot)

1216
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:17,084
- (gunshot)
- Barbee!

1217
01:24:17,086 --> 01:24:18,752
He's gaining on us!

1218
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:22,155
Stay on your horse, Slap.

1219
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,258
Let's duck down over here.

1220
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,994
Dead or alive, Barbee,
dead or alive!

1221
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:36,003
Get in there!

1222
01:24:55,724 --> 01:24:58,325
- I know you're in there, Barbee!
- (hens clucking)

1223
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:02,229
I have orders from
proper authorities

1224
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:06,733
to effect your arrest
in any manner seen fit.

1225
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:11,038
You're wanted for
the murder of ten men

1226
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,007
not including four of your own.

1227
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:17,477
My deputy Peak was among 'em!

1228
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:20,814
Yeah, well, I lay
claim to the first ten.

1229
01:25:21,016 --> 01:25:23,583
But I didn't ever touch
a single one of my own men.

1230
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,787
Either way,
that's an awful bloody grave

1231
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,555
you're sleeping in.

1232
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:32,392
Disgorge, or I'll heat it up
for you in there.

1233
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:36,730
You've come to the end of
your saga, Sweet Tooth.

1234
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:39,533
Time to face the music.

1235
01:25:40,102 --> 01:25:42,669
Yeah, well I don't
cotton that song much.

1236
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:45,272
I got one of my own.
You wanna hear it?

1237
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,507
Yeah, I'm listening.

1238
01:25:48,277 --> 01:25:51,545
<i>♪ (Claude singing
Old MacDonald Had a Farm) ♪</i>

1239
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:53,513

1240
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:14,968

1241
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,470
(lights fire)

1242
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,744
Come out stretched, Barbee.

1243
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:29,883
(horse neighing)

1244
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,247

Barbee!

1247
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,523
(gunshots)

1248
01:27:09,525 --> 01:27:10,857
Bastard!

1249
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:13,226
- Barbee!
- (gunshot)

1250
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,429
- Son of a bitch.
- (gunshot)

1251
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,310
Hyah!

1252
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,005
(groans)

1253
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:08,915
Come on, Jack. I can
almost hear the gulls.

1254
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:10,851
Come on.

1255
01:28:10,853 --> 01:28:12,752
Don't hold back
on account of me.

1256
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:16,523
Nah. No, I won't have it.
We're 50-50 now.

1257
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:19,893
We're 50-50.

1258
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,095
This one's real deep.

1259
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:25,098
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1260
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,047
All right, now close your
eyes and just bear down.

1261
01:28:41,383 --> 01:28:43,617
This is gonna hurt me
more than it does you now.

1262
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:53,727
(groaning)

1263
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:11,278
Listen, just turn your head.

1264
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,948
(groaning)

1265
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:16,883
Right there.

1266
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:24,824
(groaning)

1267
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:28,762
(coughs)

1268
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:33,300
They say never trust a man
whose heart ain't been broken.

1269
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:41,241
See, our paws left us both
when we were youngsters.

1270
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:45,211
Maws did everything they
could to raise us right,

1271
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,415
but, always had that
emptiness between us.

1272
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:53,520
I sensed it from day one.

1273
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:59,159
Fact is, I trusted you
more than any of 'em.

1274
01:29:59,628 --> 01:30:01,361
That's God's honest truth.

1275
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:04,431
Trusted you too, Claude.

1276
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,299
(inhales)

1277
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:10,136
But there is one thing about it.

1278
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:13,640
(inhales)

1279
01:30:14,376 --> 01:30:15,842
About what, the map?

1280
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:20,112
What do you mean, Slap? What do you
mean there's one thing about it?

1281
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:22,682
The waterhole.

1282
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,852
- Waterhole?
- Yeah.

1283
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,623
Go on.

1284
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:32,125
Hole...

1285
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:34,327
Tell me.

1286
01:30:34,329 --> 01:30:36,830
Look for a piggin' string.

1287
01:30:37,966 --> 01:30:39,699
- Piggin' string?
- Yeah.

1288
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:43,063
What do I do with
the piggin' string?

1289
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:45,905
Pull it.

1290
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:50,577
Pull it.

1291
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:54,147
Pull it.

1292
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,483
Pull the piggin' string.

1293
01:30:56,485 --> 01:30:57,751
Pull it.

1294
01:30:58,687 --> 01:30:59,986
Pull it.

1295
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:45,699

1296
01:31:51,907 --> 01:31:55,442
(breathes heavily)

1297
01:31:58,547 --> 01:31:59,879
Jack.

1298
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,816
Jack.

1299
01:32:03,051 --> 01:32:04,417
(screams)

1300
01:32:14,396 --> 01:32:16,429
(groans)

1301
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,499
Who did this to you, Jack?

1302
01:32:19,501 --> 01:32:21,601
Jack, who did this to you?

1303
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:25,405
Can you tell me?

1304
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:31,611
K, I...

1305
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:35,348
I know. No, I know. I know,
I know, I know, I know.

1306
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:36,616
I know what I gotta do.

1307
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,452
I know what I gotta do.

1308
01:32:43,592 --> 01:32:45,792

1309
01:32:46,928 --> 01:32:48,862
(groaning)

1310
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:52,332
Come get me, you son of a bitch.

1311
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:54,501
(gunshot)

1312
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,336
Kid.

1313
01:33:30,906 --> 01:33:34,574
(breathes heavily)

1314
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:41,414
(gunshot)

1315
01:33:46,121 --> 01:33:47,420
(screams)

1316
01:33:47,923 --> 01:33:49,489
You mean to tell me

1317
01:33:49,658 --> 01:33:51,491
that we've been
hunted this whole time

1318
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:53,927
by a measly little
pipsqueak runt?

1319
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:56,863
Where's your toy now, huh, boy?

1320
01:33:57,532 --> 01:33:59,499
You hear me? I'm talking to you!

1321
01:34:01,169 --> 01:34:04,003
You might have marked me,
you little snotnose mongrel!

1322
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:06,606
But I'll be damned if
you gonna cut me up!

1323
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:09,509
See that? Those are flames, boy!

1324
01:34:09,845 --> 01:34:11,578
I'm sending you to hell!

1325
01:34:11,947 --> 01:34:13,780
Sending you home early!

1326
01:34:13,782 --> 01:34:16,916
(groaning)

1327
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:21,721

1329
01:35:21,283 --> 01:35:22,916
Oh, you must be Paw.

1330
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:26,252
Already sent your boy
to the fiery gates.

1331
01:35:27,422 --> 01:35:29,902
Why don't you stop tinkering
with that bell, go check on him.

1332
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:32,659
You're delirious, Sweetie.

1333
01:35:32,928 --> 01:35:34,193
(chuckles)

1334
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:36,696
No matter to me though.

1335
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:39,766
Head's worth a year's pay,

1336
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:42,769
crazy or not.

1337
01:35:43,305 --> 01:35:45,145
It'd be worth a whole lot more,

1338
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,042
only you's a little late.

1343
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:37,316
I made it, Momma.

No, no, no, wait, wait!

01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,460
Ahh.

(grunts)

1353
01:38:29,137 --> 01:38:30,703
You're just a boy.

How can you be so evil?
