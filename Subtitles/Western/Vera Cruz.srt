1
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,431
Howdy.

2
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,916
You an American?

3
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,600
You interested in me or the horses?

4
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,990
Would one of 'em be for sale?

5
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,873
- One would.
- Which one?

6
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,396
Guess.

7
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,955
- How much?
- $100.

8
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,791
Gold.

9
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,878
- That's mighty hard.
- So's walkin'.

10
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,710
His leg was broke.

11
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,195
A three-legged horse'd
bring a price down here.

12
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
- He was sufferin'.
- Soft spot, huh?

13
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,191
Only for horses.

14
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,993
Next time you draw near me,
say what you're aimin' at.

15
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,475
If I have the time, I will.

16
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,875
- Government troops! Gonna run or fight?
- I got no quarrel with them.

17
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,396
Fancy shootin' for a man with no quarrel.

18
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,150
- That featherhead tried to kill me!
- Why not? That's his horse you're ridin'.

19
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,756
Back in Louisiana, we hang horse thieves!

20
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,555
Howdy.

21
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,716
Howdy.

22
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,916
I said howdy.

23
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,274
What gets into Americans down here?

24
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,476
He's got Joe's horse.

25
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,959
Friend, if you got Joe Erin,
you rode the wrong way.

26
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,674
Shoulda headed for the States
and claimed the reward.

27
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,791
All I got was his horse.

28
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,318
You're a liar!

29
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,989
You see, nobody could steal
Joe Erin's horse unless he killed him.

30
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,554
Nobody'd kill Joe
'less they shot him in the back.

31
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,035
Turn around, mister.

32
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,989
I didn't kill him.

33
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,475
Give the gent a hand first, boys.

34
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,275
A pleasure.

35
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,356
My old man always said
the bottle could ruin a man.

36
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,311
<i>(gunshots)</i>

37
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,195
Joe! You ain't dead!

38
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,956
That's what the man said.

39
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,876
We didn't know he was your friend.

40
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,197
I got no friends, Donnegan, not even you.

41
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,078
Follow him, boys. We're leavin' anyway.

42
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,476
Louisiana, huh?

43
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,874
- Mint julep, Colonel?
- Colonel?

44
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,037
- All you Southerners are colonels.
- Not any more.

45
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,398
Civil War cost me everything but my shirt.

46
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,238
- Travelling alone?
- Depends.

47
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,278
How come you stopped the fun?
You got a soft spot for an innocent man?

48
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,234
No such thing as an innocent man.

49
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,716
- You aimin' to fight in this civil war here?
- If it pays.

50
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,799
I figure a whole passel of guns'll
pay better than a lone hand.

51
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,989
Howdy.

52
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,676
Howdy.

53
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,716
About my horse...

54
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,913
<i>Your</i> horse? You found another fast one
to get you here in time to save my neck.

55
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,951
Meanin'?

56
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,435
I'll give you back your saddle.

57
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,272
Colonel,
I just don't see how the South lost.

58
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,910
Hear tell some boys
from the States is here.

59
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,191
- Trouble draws 'em like hogs to swill!
<i>- (woman screams)</i>

60
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,753
<i>(shouting)</i>

61
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,235
The boys is here, all right!

62
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,876
Let me go! <i>(screams)</i>

63
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,795
Little Bit,
you gonna put your brand on her?

64
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,876
Ride her, cowboy!

65
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,676
Hooray for the papaya lady!

66
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,278
All right, Papayas. I'll take <i>you.</i>

67
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,478
Slow down, Little Bit.
Man's just tryin' to keep you alive.

68
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,673
- Easy, friend, easy. That's Ben Trane.
- That supposed to mean somethin'?

69
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,030
He stole Joe Erin's horse and lived to tell.

70
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,116
Thank you, señor.

71
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,758
Thought your soft spot
was only for horses.

72
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,274
Boys, there's a war goin' on down here.

73
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,279
Be a shame if fine men like us
weren't on the same side.

74
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,868
Anybody wanna ride along with me?

75
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,036
We're doin' just fine on our own.

76
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,675
We're here to dicker with General
Ramirez, big chief of the rebels.

77
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,475
- How much does he pay?
- I figure that's 'tween me and him.

78
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,759
Kind of exclusive, ain't you, Charlie?

79
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,157
Gentlemen,
permit me to welcome you to Mexico.

80
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,073
- You the mayor?
- I'm the Marquis de Labordere.

81
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,954
Aide to His Imperial Majesty Maximilian,
Emperor of Mexico.

82
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,750
You are Monsieur Joe Erin?

83
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,158
- You know me?
- Indeed. The American police account...

84
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,432
...of your exploits was so inspiring
I was compelled to seek you out.

85
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,754
Hear that, Ben?

86
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,599
I offer you a commission
in the service of His Majesty.

87
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,757
You and your men could be
of profitable service to the emperor.

88
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,316
- How profitable?
- Yeah. That's what I wanna know.

89
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,154
His Majesty is extremely generous.

90
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,275
How many men have you?

91
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,110
- 17.
- Add pretty fast, don't you, Joe?

92
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,955
Anything wrong with the count?

93
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,836
Yeah.

94
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,157
You're dickering with the wrong feller.

95
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,398
Those eight men are mine.
Those seven are his.

96
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,477
If we come in... I run the show.

97
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,355
I string with Charlie.

98
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,235
Anybody else string with Charlie?

99
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,796
Bravo! It is an honour
to know you, Monsieur Erin.

100
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,673
<i>(man)</i> The honour is mine,
Your Excellency.

101
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,197
- <i>(Erin)</i> Who's he?
- <i>(marquis)</i> A Juarista... a rebel.

102
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,353
A soldier in the army
of Benito Juárez, señor.

103
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,835
- I am General Ramirez.
- General?

104
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,589
- What's your proposition, General?
- We would like you to join us.

105
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,190
You'd be wasting your talents. These
peasants have no money to pay you.

106
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,551
As Americans, you can appreciate
our fight for independence.

107
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,355
We offer you more than money, señor.
We offer a cause.

108
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,918
How 'bout that, Ben? This here's
our cause expert. Fought for the South.

109
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,157
A brave struggle, señor.
My congratulations.

110
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,589
What for? We lost.

111
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,511
You were sayin'...
the emperor was extremely generous.

112
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,668
I am sorry, señor.
His Excellency is now our prisoner.

113
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,757
- What'd you say?
- The marquis is our prisoner.

114
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,836
So are the rest of you.

115
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,434
Each one of you is a target for 20 of us.

116
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,591
At this range,
even <i>our</i> ancient weapons are effective.

117
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,030
- If it's that easy, what's stoppin' you?
- We're not savages, señor.

118
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,390
We do not kill in cold blood.

119
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,035
But we cannot permit you
to serve with Maximilian.

120
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,391
If you do not surrender
before Pedro finishes his song...

121
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,798
Better make it a long one, Pedro,
cos you ain't ever gonna play another!

122
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,036
Hold it!

123
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,151
Get those children outta here.

124
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,759
Yeah, sure... Always did like kids.
How about you, General?

125
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,359
Certainly.

126
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,358
Donnegan! Pittsburgh!
Get those kids inside.

127
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,674
<i>(Donnegan)</i> Come on, kids.

128
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,756
<i>(Pittsburgh)</i> Hurry up! Pronto!

129
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,156
All right, Joe!

130
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,829
The two inside will not stop us.
Nor will 200.

131
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,997
No, but they can stop a lot of kids
from growin' up, amigo.

132
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,078
- Donnegan!
- Just say the word, Joe!

133
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,759
You want those kids to live,
get your men up that hill.

134
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,235
We'll leave then, not before.

135
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,113
Wars are not won by killing children.

136
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,516
<i>Hasta la vista, señores.</i>

137
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,038
I give you my word we will meet again.

138
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,353
Donnegan! Pittsburgh!
Turn the kids loose.

139
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,076
Fascinating man, your friend...
and a brilliant bluff about those children.

140
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,156
Or was it a bluff?

141
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,714
They're still alive, aren't they?

142
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,239
- Where's this palace of Max's?
- Mexico City. We'll be there by nightfall.

143
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,112
Let's ride.

144
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,555
If this blue coat don't rile you,
Mr Trane, I'd like to ride along.

145
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,070
Can you think of a better man?
He won the war, didn't he?

146
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,998
- Suit yourself.
- The man's crazy about you.

147
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,678
Move along.

148
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,757
- My wallet!
- To you, señor, it is free.

149
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,669
It is useless to look for it now. In Mexico,
a thief disappears like a puff of smoke.

150
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,189
It's only cowhide, Ben.
Max'll buy you another.

151
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,916
It wasn't the wallet,
it's the sentiment. I had $12 in it!

152
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,915
- <i>(Erin)</i> Old Max sure knows how to live.
- The fanciest lodge hall I ever seen!

153
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,875
<i>- (man)</i> Hey, come on down here!
- <i>(man #2)</i> What's at this end?

154
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,275
Aren't you going to join us, monsieur?

155
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,949
- The emperor built quite a palace.
- You know its history?

156
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,951
We had books in the South...

157
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,868
And one or two homes that once
might have stood beside all this.

158
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,991
Once?

159
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,918
There's nothin' ever destroyed
that can't be rebuilt.

160
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,316
Perhaps...
if a man wants to badly enough.

161
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,960
I didn't come down here for the ride.

162
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,752
Aw, come one, take just
a little bite! Come on!

163
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,954
- What do you suppose is wrong with her?
- Try approaching 'em downwind.

164
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,036
Oh, gentlemen.

165
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,994
May I present Captain Danette?
Monsieur Erin, Monsieur Trane.

166
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,953
You'll find something in common
with this gentleman.

167
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,152
As a soldier, he fought with
the American Confederate Army.

168
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,430
Then I feel we'll have little in common.

169
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,030
You see, I've never fought
with a losing side.

170
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,469
That's cos you ain't ever fought him!

171
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,795
He has you there, Captain, I assure you.

172
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,071
Excuse me. The captain will
take care of your needs from now on.

173
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,156
Tell Max we're waitin'!

174
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,517
Your acquaintance with
etiquette amazes me, monsieur.

175
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,234
I had no idea you knew
which hand to use.

176
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,159
When I was no higher than
a hound dog's tail on point...

177
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,158
...I had a little tin soldier, about so high.

178
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,794
And one day I lost him... and I cried.

179
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,515
My mother said "Stop bawlin'. Someday
that soldier's bound to show up."

180
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,596
And she was right.

181
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,956
You're back.

182
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,279
<i>- (coughs)</i>
- Joe! Over there!

183
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,838
Careful, monsieur. Some of the wine
is getting in your mouth.

184
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,676
Hello...

185
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,111
Hello!

186
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,477
Marie.
You're looking your loveliest this evening.

187
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,794
Thank you, Henri.

188
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,275
<i>(shouting and laughter)</i>

189
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,109
<i>Mon cher</i> Henri,
it's so nice to have you safely back.

190
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,800
The palace seemed empty without you.

191
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,908
Obviously your trip was successful.

192
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,430
Successful but... distasteful.

193
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,274
May I introduce Monsieur Erin, Monsieur
Trane? The Comtesse Marie Duvarre.

194
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,355
<i>Enchantée.</i>

195
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,914
No wonder you was in
such a fire to get here.

196
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,713
<i>Tous les Américains, ils sont très beaux.</i>

197
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,913
- You are being complimented.
<i>- Merci. Vous seriez belle n'importe où.</i>

198
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,271
Monsieur, your French
is as pretty as your flattery.

199
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,834
In New Orleans,
we learn how to handle both.

200
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,632
- Dirty son of a...
<i>- (fanfare)</i>

201
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,831
His Majesty the emperor.

202
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,395
Excuse me, gentlemen, please.

203
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,230
- Your Majesty.
- Henri.

204
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,919
They're a disreputable-looking band.
Do they know the nature of their mission?

205
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,828
Only that they will be
handsomely rewarded.

206
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,713
Do you consider death
a handsome enough reward for them?

207
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,990
If not from the guns of the Juaristas...

208
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,237
...perhaps from the steel
of Your Majesty's lancers.

209
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,830
You may present me
to the courageous little group.

210
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,151
- Your Majesty, allow me to...
- <i>(all speak at once)</i>

211
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,999
I implore your indulgence.
They are not familiar with court protocol.

212
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,749
It is gratifying that you men
are so sympathetic with our position...

213
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,078
...that you offer your services to us.
- Let's get one thing clear, Your Majesty.

214
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,395
Our services come high.

215
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,274
I hope the emperor is more interested
in fire power than protocol.

216
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,155
Precisely. Our primary concern is getting
a coach through Juarista country...

217
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,590
...to the port at Vera Cruz.
- May I humbly remind Your Majesty...

218
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,915
...that my lancers will also take part.

219
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,554
Quiet. You failed before.

220
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,836
I beg your indulgence, sire.
But why should these men do any better?

221
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,196
Pittsburgh.

222
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,910
- This is why.
- Indeed.

223
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,272
May I? I am something of a marksman.

224
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,429
Ah, yes... the new
Winchester repeating rifle.

225
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,156
I hear it fires faster than the double-action
pistol, and as far as the eye can see.

226
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,511
Mister, it does everything
but shoot around corners.

227
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,312
Most amusing.

228
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,319
But, of course, a weapon is only
as good as the man who uses it.

229
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,150
Monsieur!

230
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,398
Hold on to your hat, Max. And don't
worry about the women and children.

231
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,796
<i>Fantastique!</i>

232
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,519
<i>Magnifique!</i>

233
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,949
Three torches left.
A pity your gun is empty.

234
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,072
It's not.
Your Majesty said he was a marksman.

235
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,996
Allow me, sire.

236
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,156
Thank you, monsieur.

237
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,230
Bravo! Bravo!

238
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,075
All the way forward...

239
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,436
All the way back.

240
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,076
<i>(applause)</i>

241
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,073
Bravo!

242
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,352
Bravo!

243
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,429
Perhaps I better stop.
We have a servant problem as it is.

244
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,630
<i>(gasps)</i>

245
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,152
I assure Your Majesty I shall be
perfectly safe with these gentlemen.

246
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,238
Well, then, I suppose I must approve.

247
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,954
You see, it is the countess
who will occupy the coach.

248
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,471
She's decided that she must see Paris
again, and we indulge her every whim.

249
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,072
The marquis wants her to reach
the ship at Vera Cruz safely.

250
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,156
She will if the price is right.

251
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,831
I suppose when one deals with men
of action, one must expect action.

252
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,270
Does 25,000 in gold sound reasonable?

253
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,679
A pretty figure... but only half as pretty
as the figure we're escorting to Vera Cruz.

254
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,509
I gather that double would increase
your sense of responsibility?

255
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,949
It would double it.

256
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,036
50,000 it is, then.

257
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,076
I'll be a dirty...

258
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,470
The water is about to come in!

259
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,510
Joe's pretty fast on the draw!

260
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,232
I'd prefer he restricted
his speed to his gun!

261
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,200
Funny country, isn't it? A carriage cuts
deeper tracks than an overloaded wagon.

262
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,230
Yeah, funny country, all right.

263
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,554
A very large convoy
to protect one woman.

264
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,989
It will take two days
to get men for an attack.

265
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,314
- Get them!
- Yes, sir.

266
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,591
But in the meantime a few
will have to do the work of many.

267
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,874
- You are welcome, señor.
- We need food and drink for 70 people.

268
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,797
Your best - you understand?

269
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,629
But, señor, our provisions are scarce,
and the emperor does not pay.

270
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,195
We dine in an hour.

271
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,872
They have a very passable wine here -
vintage of '59. We'll stay the night.

272
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,309
Easy to defend, too.

273
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,311
My dear, you are unusually
gallant this evening.

274
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,796
- As gallant as the two Americans?
- You surprise me, Henri.

275
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,993
You should know there is never
anything to fear from <i>two</i> men.

276
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,472
<i>(music and laughter)</i>

277
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,115
Your French is as pretty
as your flattery, mon-sewer.

278
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,632
Ma'am,
learned my French in old New Orleans.

279
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,475
Oh! You wanna play, huh?

280
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,875
<i>Voulez-vous</i> get off my toe?!

281
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,638
Aw, Tex! I told you to be careful!

282
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,390
You Americans are so gallant!

283
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,070
Come on, Countessy. Let's go!

284
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,072
<i>(music stops)</i>

285
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,350
Come on, Joe. Give it back.

286
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,436
Sure.

287
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,239
A little careless with
your hardware, ain't ya?

288
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,238
- Look out behind you, Joe!
- Ah, come on, Little Bit.

289
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,510
You can do better than that.

290
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,472
Careful, Joe.

291
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,150
It's cocked.

292
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,112
Well, what do you know?
So it is. Catch it, Little Bit!

293
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,512
You boys ain't gonna let
a little gunshot spoil the party?

294
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,997
Ballad, show us really how to dance.
Give us a hoedown, Pittsburgh!

295
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,956
<i>(music starts)</i>

296
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,116
Anything you say, Mr Erin.

297
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,356
- Hello...
- Hello!

298
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,270
How much d'you think is there?

299
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,876
Just enough.

300
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,597
For two?

301
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,676
Good evening.

302
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,269
Each one of those six boxes contains
half a million dollars in gold.

303
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,437
- Three million!
- Sure has a nice ring to it.

304
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,114
You plannin' to visit Paris or <i>buy</i> it?

305
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,234
This is the money to bring troops from
Europe to keep Maximilian on the throne.

306
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,996
But I can think of many uses for it
more civilised than war.

307
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,713
- Ma'am, you're just full of surprises.
- Then let me add another.

308
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,549
- One million's enough for me.
- It ain't for <i>me.</i>

309
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,636
I'm a pig.

310
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,198
Be a shame not to keep it all in one piece.

311
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,517
Perhaps. But neither of you
can get out of the country alone.

312
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,755
If the Juaristas captured it,
they could win.

313
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,190
- They ain't gonna capture it.
- You don't know the Juaristas.

314
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,359
They are suspicious already. Even
Maximilian needed <i>me</i> for camouflage.

315
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,597
How come he made
the mistake of pickin' you?

316
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,393
The emperor is very fond
of the marquis...

317
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,353
...so I made sure
the marquis became fond of me.

318
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,950
Looks like you been thinkin'
about this for a long time.

319
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,277
I have.

320
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,517
There will be a sea captain
to meet me in Las Palmas.

321
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,114
He has a fast ship
up the coast from Vera Cruz.

322
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,196
The marquis know about that?

323
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,953
Unfortunately, as I have
discovered to my embarrassment...

324
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,230
...Henri is loyal to his emperor.

325
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,993
But I dare say he would be willing to...
die for Maximilian.

326
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,799
- How do we know we can trust you?
- How do I know I can trust <i>you?</i>

327
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,117
Countess, you're beginnin'
to talk my language.

328
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,592
- And yours?
- Should be an interesting trip!

329
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,758
I wish you'd stop drawin' around me!

330
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,189
Now, gentlemen.

331
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,470
It's a long way to Vera Cruz.

332
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,835
You see that? <i>(laughs)</i>

333
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,916
You must have had a restful night
to find the morning so amusing.

334
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,395
It's the countess. She's quite a woman!

335
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,318
Indeed. She's worth her weight in gold.

336
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,231
Now.

337
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,552
Now.

338
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,550
Out of the way, peasants!

339
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,316
Not yet!

340
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,916
Joe!

341
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,038
The carriage!

342
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,515
The carriage!

343
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,391
Forward!

344
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,789
Hey! You saved my bacon back there!

345
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,956
Sorry I was so slow gettin' to ya.

346
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,231
You'd have been a little slower,
you'd have stood to be richer.

347
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,670
- Maybe I didn't think of that.
- Too bad you never knew Ace Hanna.

348
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,756
Ran a gamblin' joint back in Laredo.

349
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,440
Shot my old man in a stud game
when I was still a kid.

350
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,633
- Ace felt so bad, he give me a home.
- What's it got to do with my savin' you?

351
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,228
Ace said "Don't take
any chances you don't have to."

352
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,559
"Don't trust anybody you don't have to.
Don't do no favours you don't have to do."

353
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,352
Ace lived long enough to know he was
right. He lived 30 seconds after I shot him.

354
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,396
You know somethin'? That's the first time
I ever told anybody the story of my life.

355
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,350
Thanks.

356
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,356
Halt the caravan! Count the casualties!

357
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,997
- Well, if it isn't Papayas!
- Why don't you let a <i>real</i> man try it?

358
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,635
You'll never catch her, Pittsburgh!

359
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,309
What's the matter?
Ain't you gonna scream?

360
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,638
I like 'em when they scream. Maybe you
can bring Ben Trane to the rescue again.

361
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,513
- Ain't that right, Donnegan?
- Right.

362
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,396
Hold it!

363
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,350
- Where did she come from?
- She's here of her own free will.

364
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,355
- I'll believe that when you let her go.
- You was a man, you'd get off that horse.

365
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,354
I'll get off when you turn her loose.

366
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,752
<i>(whispers)</i> Shoot him as he's gettin' off.

367
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,916
We're waitin'!

368
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,393
You boys had enough fightin' for the day?

369
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,670
You heard the man.

370
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,477
Tex, get aboard that wagon.

371
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,279
Well... that old Southern charm.
Draws 'em like bees to honey, eh, Ben?

372
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,233
She snaked that wagon outta there
just like a mule skinner.

373
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,557
- Mount up, Ballad.
- I just wanted to get to Vera Cruz.

374
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,035
Just for the ride to Vera Cruz?

375
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,355
You did a favour for me once.

376
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,119
Is it too much to expect another?

377
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,152
That was a nice new dress you're wearin'.

378
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,477
You wouldn't turn her down, would ya?
It'd break her heart.

379
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,116
Captain Danette informed me of your
heroics. My compliments, mademoiselle.

380
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,470
We want an explanation
of your presence here.

381
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,512
Ain't you heard?
We just picked up a passenger.

382
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,074
Such decisions are up to the marquis.

383
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,553
Well?

384
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,639
I wish you a pleasant journey to Vera
Cruz. It's time we were starting again.

385
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,910
Mount the caravan!

386
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,788
Oh.

387
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,070
- Thank you, señor.
- Forward!

388
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,110
Kinda cosy, ain't it, Ben?
Now we <i>both</i> got girls.

389
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,270
You just can't do
enough for me, can you?

390
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,358
Why not? You're the first friend I ever had.

391
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,230
- That's the fifth one we've seen today.
- Sixth. I bet these hills are full of 'em.

392
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,238
It's a cinch
they ain't gonna wait much longer.

393
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,072
Hey, you! Wake up!
Keep your eyes on the road!

394
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,318
Your concern for the safety of the
carriage is most gratifying, monsieur.

395
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,590
Protecting the countess
is what I'm here for.

396
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,837
Is that all? I like to think
you're here to protect the wagons...

397
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,748
...the supplies,
the horses... to say nothing of myself.

398
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,750
That marquis has too many teeth
in that crocodile smile. I don't like it.

399
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,112
Then don't make so much fuss
over this carriage... or me.

400
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,388
We get to Las Palmas, if that ship captain
ain't there, you'll <i>really</i> see a fuss.

401
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,795
<i>(gunshot)</i>

402
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,190
- I see we have a prisoner.
- And three missing lancers.

403
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,675
Not a very good swap.

404
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,836
<i>(Danette)</i> Run! Run, you fool!

405
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,875
Why don't they try throwin' rocks?

406
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,675
You wouldn't want to see
the game end too soon, monsieur.

407
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,948
<i>(Juarista)</i> Long live Juárez!

408
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,036
<i>(screams)</i>

409
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,477
- Pleasant trip?
- It is not pleasant to see a man killed.

410
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,273
- Even a Juarista.
- Even a Juarista?

411
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,233
That's strange coming from a Mexican.

412
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,670
It is hard to be a patriot
on an empty stomach.

413
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,315
What if Ramirez and the Juaristas win?
Things might be different.

414
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,671
How can they win without money?
Without guns?

415
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,429
You saw General Ramirez,
and you chose Maximilian.

416
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,120
Why should I be different?

417
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:01,119
You <i>are</i> different.
Most girls don't steal wallets.

418
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,992
Where is it?

419
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:08,194
If you believe that, señor,
why did you let me come with you?

420
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,108
- Hand it over.
- Have you looked for it lately?

421
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,276
Of course, it is empty.

422
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,755
Hm. $12!

423
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,438
Picking pockets is a habit hard to break.

424
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,952
Why are you so anxious
to get to Vera Cruz?

425
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,278
For me,
it is not wise to stay too long in one place.

426
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,916
And in Vera Cruz there are
many people... and many pockets.

427
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,915
And many dresses.

428
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,511
They say that a thief in Mexico today
can disappear like a puff of smoke.

429
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,679
- Is that true?
- You can see smoke disappear.

430
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,839
Suppose I wanted to get to
Vera Cruz alone... Could I do it?

431
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,110
It's possible, señor.

432
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,750
But why?

433
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,795
A man named Ace Hanna used to say:
"It never hurts to have an ace in the hole."

434
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,190
We would go together?

435
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,590
You never can tell.

436
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,318
I'm just liable to get that filled for ya.

437
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,918
- Henri?
- Yes?

438
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,318
I should like to stop here.
Las Palmas is famous for its fiestas.

439
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,910
Of course. And you must be tired.

440
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,714
<i>(music stops)</i>

441
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,913
Continue with your dancing!
I enjoy seeing our people happy.

442
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,196
<i>(music resumes)</i>

443
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,874
- We halt here.
- But we could push on to the next town.

444
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,753
This will make it difficult
to reach Vera Cruz tomorrow.

445
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,236
It is the countess's wish.
I do not intend to disappoint her.

446
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,079
I will see the mayor provides us
with food and quarters.

447
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,112
Food only. Quarters will not be necessary.

448
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,994
You see, it is here that
the countess intends to betray us.

449
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,476
Halt the caravan.

450
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,910
I'll take this.

451
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,838
Of course. Anything you say, monsieur.

452
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,154
- Gettin' very polite, isn't he?
- Yeah.

453
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,238
- That ship captain here?
- In front of the cantina.

454
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,316
The man with the whiskers.

455
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,076
- He will come to me later.
- Why not now?

456
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,237
We must be careful
not to arouse the marquis' suspicion.

457
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,319
You see, he may not trust us
as much as we trust each other.

458
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,390
He been to see her yet?

459
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,557
Not yet. He don't make a move soon,
I'm gonna work on him myself.

460
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,708
Easy. Wait till he's had a chance
to tell the countess where the ship is.

461
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,195
- You ain't a fool enough to trust her?
- No.

462
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,993
But she can't make a move,
not without us.

463
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,510
Tell me somethin'. How come you let
a little thing like the Civil War bust ya?

464
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,157
I made the mistake of fightin'
the last battle on my own property.

465
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,513
Well, don't you worry. After this you can
build her up again, outta solid marble.

466
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,238
I guess you don't know much
about a plantation, do ya?

467
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,319
It's not just a house.
It's land... a lot of people.

468
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,474
And right now they're in a pretty bad fix.

469
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,388
They're sorta dependin' on you
to get 'em started again, Colonel?

470
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,956
I guess that old soft spot
ain't only for horses, huh?

471
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:42,908
You keep an eye on that captain.
I'll watch the gold.

472
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,715
<i>(gunshot)</i>

473
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,832
All right, you boys.
Let's just keep right on playin'.

474
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,951
I never played with no real band before.

475
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,115
<i>Vous avez une allumette, monsieur?</i>

476
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,796
- Señor, you startled me!
- How did you get in there?

477
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,196
I told them the countess
had sent me for a dress.

478
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,312
- It's a good thing I'm not the countess.
- Don't tell her.

479
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,476
I wanted to wear it at the fiesta.

480
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,672
- But she's sure to be there.
- But by then I will have it on.

481
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,679
- It will be worth it, señor.
- When she sees you with that dre...

482
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,234
I thought you were
keepin' an eye on that captain.

483
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,831
He just went in to see her. I'll give him
some time. Everything all right here?

484
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,635
Quiet as a churchyard,
if you don't count that fandango.

485
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,590
Sounds kinda nice, doesn't it?

486
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,117
Must be hard for a man to keep his mind
on his job when music like that gets goin'.

487
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,549
Guess it is, if you think about it.

488
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,353
- Anybody pokin' around?
- Not a soul.

489
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,795
If they had, you'd have shot 'em.

490
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,630
Wouldn't you?

491
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,274
All right, Joe. You saw her.

492
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,198
I'd have stopped her on her tracks... dead.

493
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,470
For stealin' a dress?

494
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,230
You and Ace Hanna wouldn't
have lasted long as partners.

495
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,238
I don't figure Ace
would have had much choice.

496
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,554
By joining the ship in this cove here...

497
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,433
...you won't have to worry
about the garrison at Vera Cruz.

498
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,155
- I shall be there by sundown tomorrow.
- You and all these Americans?

499
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,114
Only two.
The others will be lost along the way.

500
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,472
- The longboat will be on the beach.
- But one thing must be understood:

501
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,115
When I come aboard with the gold,
I come alone.

502
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,109
- But the two Americans?
- I repeat: I come aboard alone.

503
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,115
Very good. I have a well-trained
and well-armed crew.

504
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,194
- Shall I leave this, or can you remember?
- I can remember.

505
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,918
- <i>(banging)</i>
- Who is it?

506
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,508
- Open up!
- Joseph! Oh!

507
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,790
I was just going to send for you.

508
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,636
Joseph!

509
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,398
This is Capitaine Lecroix. Monsieur Erin -
the gentleman I mentioned.

510
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,396
A pleasure, monsieur.

511
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,990
- Until tomorrow, then.
- Of course.

512
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,196
What's your hurry?

513
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,710
But, Joseph, everything's arranged.

514
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,276
He has a long journey.
You wouldn't want to delay him.

515
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,076
To Paris!

516
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,275
- You forget who I am.
- I don't forget a thing.

517
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,914
- He looked at me like I was a dead man!
- Ridiculous!

518
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,389
I've seen that look
too many times not to know it.

519
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,034
- If you trust me so little...
- I don't trust you at all.

520
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,674
All you want is that gold.
You won't get it without me.

521
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,837
I'm takin' over that boat
before you ever set foot aboard her.

522
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,669
That's why you'll take anything
I hand out and learn to like it.

523
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,273
See? Because you and me is the same.

524
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,594
<i>Sale brute!</i> I should have made
my deal with Monsieur Trane.

525
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,676
Old Ben Trane...

526
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,275
He's quite a feller.

527
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,029
Aide to General Beauregard.
Whipped his weight in Yankees.

528
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,677
And a gentleman.
A real Southern gentleman!

529
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,718
Colonel Ben Trane,
ma'am, at your service.

530
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:11,470
I don't trust him. He likes people and
you can never count on a man like that.

531
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:21,077
Do you mean... it would be
just the two of us, Joseph?

532
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,840
I was wonderin'
if that captain could swim.

533
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,713
I've always wanted to sail my own boat.

534
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,236
But, Joseph...

535
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,112
...you will have a million and a half
and I'll have a million and a half.

536
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,312
And... we will have each other.

537
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,189
But Monsieur Trane...
how will we slip away from him?

538
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:54,514
Funny... runnin' my fingers through
your hair, I feel it way down in my toes.

539
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,156
But, Joseph, we have so little time,
and Monsieur Trane knows our plans.

540
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,236
Part of our plan.

541
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,515
How much of your plans do <i>I know?

542
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,792
<i>Chérie...</i>

543
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,593
You are wondering why
I should share anything with you.

544
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,359
But, <i>chérie,</i> you know where the boat is.

545
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,519
But afterward... we must be careful...

546
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,518
...one doesn't push the other overboard.

547
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,273
Ace Hanna'd be proud
of the way you think.

548
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,356
So am I.

549
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,636
Joseph...

550
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,954
...you are born American...

551
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,036
...but at heart you're French.

552
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,990
- Take it off.
- The countess has missed it?

553
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,270
Don't worry about that. Hurry.

554
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,032
I <i>am</i> hurrying. Do you want me to tear it?

555
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,391
There'll be no time for any fiesta tonight.

556
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,677
Look. Isn't it magnificent?

557
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,274
And feel. It is silk.

558
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,755
The first silk I ever wore.

559
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,997
I wanted you to see me in it, just once.

560
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,192
- Found the gold in there, didn't you?
- Gold?

561
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,392
The gold you've been looking for
since you joined this outfit.

562
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,796
- You can't believe that.
- You knew the carriage was guarded.

563
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,311
You wouldn't have sneaked in for a dress,
not if it was made of all the silk in China.

564
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,079
All right. You knew I was a thief.

565
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,311
Not only a thief - a Juarista.

566
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,479
How can you say that? <i>I drove the wagon
out when the Juaristas attacked.

567
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,355
Sure - after the attack. Don't try to lie
to me. All you people are Juaristas.

568
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,391
Then why did you help me?

569
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,710
Because I need <i>your</i> help - now.

570
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,237
You're not like these other men,
these hired killers.

571
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,715
You know Maximilian
has no right to this gold.

572
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,833
That gold belongs to the man who gets it.
Joe Erin or me.

573
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,599
You like that dress.
How would you like a dozen of 'em?

574
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,757
A hundred, with hats and shoes
and parasols to match?

575
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,677
How can you even say this?

576
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,473
Because that gold belongs
to both of us together.

577
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,990
You and I both know that no cause
is worth three million dollars.

578
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,509
<i>(gunshots)</i>

579
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,596
Wait here!

580
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,599
- The horses!
- What's it about?

581
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,234
Round up the men and get the horses!

582
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,596
They got the carriage!

583
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,151
Hold it!

584
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,192
We'll get the carriage back,
but we'll get it back together.

585
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,470
Now cut this lead out!

586
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,232
- Why weren't you sittin' on that gold?
- What were <i>you</i> doin'?

587
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,272
Never mind that now. Cut that bullet out!

588
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,675
A pleasure!

589
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,315
- What's up?
- Don't pester him! The man's sufferin'.

590
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,590
Hold it!

591
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,556
We <i>all</i> wanna see what's in there.

592
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,434
It's kinda funny the way you two
been takin' care of this carriage lately.

593
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,154
And not sayin' nothin' to the rest of us.

594
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,596
You boys sobered up mighty fast.

595
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,317
A few gunshots'll do it
every time, Mr Trane.

596
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,960
If what we think is in there...

597
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,392
...we'd just have to figure you two
was crossin' us, wouldn't we?

598
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,476
Now open it up!

599
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,870
Looks like the marquis beat us to it, Joe.

600
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,276
Nothin'!

601
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,554
Still a fool for luck, ain't ya, Joe?

602
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,036
<i>(gunshot)</i>

603
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,556
Man, oh, man!

604
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,595
- Pittsburgh! The Winchesters!
- He'll never make it!

605
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,190
He gone crazy?

606
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,310
Wait a minute.

607
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,275
- You were right, General. We meet again.
- You are wise to surrender, señor.

608
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,234
Surrender? Hardly!
But why waste lives over nothing?

609
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,432
There's no gold there to fight over.

610
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,835
Pedro.

611
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,751
We've all been tricked.
I've an idea that gold is in a wagon...

612
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,950
...headin' for the garrison at Vera Cruz.

613
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,514
You did not walk out here
just to tell me that.

614
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,069
I suggest we join forces and get it back.

615
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,115
No. That gold belongs to Mexico.
It cannot be shared with anyone.

616
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,391
We don't ask a share, only fair payment.

617
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,476
$100,000.

618
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,272
- A lot of money.
- A lot of us will die earning it.

619
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,999
Very well. Payment to be contingent
on the capture of the gold.

620
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,554
I take your word, señor.

621
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,035
And we will keep the bargain.

622
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,237
Sure gotta hand it to ya, Colonel.

623
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,796
Robert E Lee himself never
made a smarter manoeuvre.

624
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,592
For 100,000...
Maybe I should have doubled the ante.

625
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,269
Why worry about the ante
with three million still in the pot?

626
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:31,518
You know somethin'? You're gettin'
more like Ace Hanna every day.

627
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,995
From now on,
it's me and you right down the line.

628
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,475
Just like it's always been, Joe?

629
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,832
- You ain't sore, are ya?
- Now, what have I got to be sore about?

630
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,908
All right, Ben. I was a fool
to even think of crossin' ya.

631
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,676
How'd you figure it out so fast?

632
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,951
Old crocodile teeth
switchin' the gold to the wagon?

633
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,949
Old crocodile teeth and I had
the same idea... only he got to it faster.

634
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,390
Well, I'll be a dirty...

635
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,430
- You managed to precede me, Captain.
- My route was more direct, sir.

636
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,633
- And I had good reason for haste.
- No doubt. But the ruse was successful.

637
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,560
The emperor will be pleased.
Is the ship waiting?

638
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,749
Yes, sir.

639
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,111
The captain is sending an escort
to take you and the cargo aboard...

640
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:48,119
...in time to leave with the morning tide.
- Good. Now...

641
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,153
I am sure you will enjoy
sending me to a dungeon, Henri.

642
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,756
Certainly not.

643
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,835
The countess has lived
a most comfortable life so far.

644
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,428
See that she enjoys the brief remainder.

645
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:09,516
Yes, sir.

646
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,596
This way, madame.

647
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,476
<i>Gracias.</i>

648
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,910
- They're more friendly than I expected.
- What do you mean, "friendly"?

649
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,160
They're playin' us for suckers. They figure
we're gonna get that gold back for 'em.

650
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,991
Hey, Ben...
I didn't know these yokels could write.

651
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,635
- What are they up to?
- They know it won't be any picnic.

652
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,752
Wanna be sure and get buried
under the right name.

653
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,678
It's a good idea.
You write my name, I write yours.

654
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,950
We'll fool Saint Peter yet!

655
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,115
- What luck?
- We went all the way around the fort.

656
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:16,519
- They are better prepared than last time.
- And our attack failed the last time.

657
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,715
Señores, I'm glad you're here.
How can we best use your Winchesters?

658
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,559
They're the nearest thing
to artillery you have.

659
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,549
Very well. You will cover us
with fire while we assault the gates.

660
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:33,832
Hey, General, that's a great idea!
We'll be right behind ya!

661
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,633
Hey, amigo, what you got there? Tequila?

662
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:42,553
Strange man, señor. The first like him I
ever met who could be happy with his lot.

663
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:46,150
Why is that strange? He stands
a chance to win a big prize tomorrow.

664
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:49,875
Money. Is that worth risking your life for?

665
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,878
Comes closer than anything I know.

666
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,073
A man's got to have more than that.
He needs something to believe in.

667
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,156
I got that too.

668
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,232
- You two have met before.
- A couple of times.

669
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,551
You are surprised to see me?

670
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,116
Why? I believe last night
both of us knew...

671
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,275
...that gold belongs to Mexico.

672
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,030
Like bees to honey, eh, Ben?

673
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,716
Thanks.

674
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,912
<i>(gunfire)</i>

675
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:03,473
Looks like we tied up
with the wrong outfit.

676
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,913
Give 'em some help.
Aim for the windows!

677
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,113
On to the second position!

678
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,636
Let's go!

679
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,350
Nice shootin', Colonel!

680
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,599
They got a lotta guts.
If they get that gold, they'll have earned it!

681
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,632
You ain't thinkin' of keepin' that bargain?

682
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,913
I wouldn't give 'em the sweat off my brow!

683
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,996
Grenade!

684
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,596
Move it, men!

685
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,276
Joseph!

686
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,076
- <i>Chérie!</i> Where's the gold?
- The marquis! He's making a run for it!

687
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,270
Ben! The marquis!

688
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,309
- Ballad! Donnegan!
- Be right back.

689
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,758
Go!

690
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,680
Ballad! Snake that wagon outta here!

691
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,990
- Oh, <i>chérie...</i>
- Where's the boat?

692
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,954
Only a few miles. The next cove
up the coast... the north side.

693
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,958
Now we both know where it is. Don't we?

694
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,759
Joseph, you're taking me with you?

695
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,237
You and Ben Trane... you'll never learn.
So long, <i>chérie!</i>

696
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,269
- Hold it, Ballad! You got a passenger.
- We got it, Mr Erin!

697
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,675
<i>(gunshot)</i>

698
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,076
Thanks.

699
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,916
Joe!

700
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,957
Looks like you meant
that Ace Hanna story after all.

701
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,834
Too bad you missed the point.
I'm takin' that wagon out.

702
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,998
That gold's goin' to the Juaristas.

703
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:50,072
Not if you give me a fair chance at a draw.

704
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,155
Just like you gave Ballad.

705
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,750
That old soft spot, eh, Ben?

706
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,836
Even Ace had one, Joe.

707
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,076
That was Ace's mistake.

708
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,035
