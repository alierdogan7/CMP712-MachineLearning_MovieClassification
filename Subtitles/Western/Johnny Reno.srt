1
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,995
Ab!

2
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,118
Probably a lawman.

3
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,630
Hey, that don't mean he's after us.

4
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,075
Everybody in this territory's after us.

5
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,952
Hasn't spotted us yet.

6
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,474
And we ain't waiting around
until he does.

7
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,272
Now he's spotted us.

8
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,834
- Let's make a run for it.
- We've been running.

9
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,470
It would've been easier to kill you.

10
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,676
You should have, mister.

11
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,474
Don't threaten a man while you're down.

12
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,717
You killed my brother.

13
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,556
He never harmed anybody...

14
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,357
anybody in his whole life.

15
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,035
Except he tried to bushwhack me.

16
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,637
You were hunting us.

17
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,835
I was heading for Stone Junction.

18
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,991
You tracked us up here.

19
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,711
I don't even know your names.

20
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,918
Ab and Joe Conners.

21
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,752
I never heard of you.

22
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,231
You must be lying, mister.

23
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,273
You were probably
backing up the posse.

24
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,108
Or helping the Indians trying to find us.

25
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,555
Posse? Indians?

26
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,235
You didn't know we were being wanted?

27
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,396
Marshal, you mean to say...

28
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,033
that you were just riding by
down there...

29
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,037
all peaceful-like?

30
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,951
Minding my own business.

31
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,952
You hear that, Ab?

32
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,031
We opened fire...

33
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,470
and he wasn't even after us.

34
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,359
If you've got a posse and Indians
both after you...

35
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,431
We didn't kill that Indian!

36
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,118
I'm gonna take him and you
to Stone Junction.

37
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,394
You ain't taking me to Stone Junction.

38
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,556
Find out what this is all about.

39
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,709
My life isn't worth two cents there.

40
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,319
Indians get you, it'll be worth even less.

41
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,839
You mean...

42
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,757
you didn't hear anything about us
in Kansas City?

43
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,878
No, not a thing.

44
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,589
How come you were headed
towards Stone Junction?

45
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,037
I have business there.

46
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,952
- Law business?
- No. Personal.

47
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,398
This man Conners?

48
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,798
This is his brother.

49
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,711
It was for us to kill him!

50
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,795
Pity he didn't know that
before he started shooting at me.

51
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,998
- This one.
- This one I'm taking in.

52
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,518
He come with us.

53
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,719
No. He'll be tried in a white man's court.

54
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,672
White man's court.

55
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,512
For many moons we have been
at peace with white man.

56
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,634
You want this peace end
because of him?

57
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,031
Before we start spilling blood,
tell Chief Little Bear what I said.

58
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,073
I'm the one called Reno.
He knows me as a man of honour.

59
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,119
Bluffed them out.

60
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,312
Don't count on it.

61
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,548
Duggan!

62
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,795
Look at them staring at me.

63
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,871
How does that shoulder feel?

64
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,269
Like a bonfire going full blast.

65
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,677
Joe Conners all right.

66
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,077
The other one under the blanket
must be his brother Ab.

67
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,516
That's the first ghost I've ever seen
in broad daylight.

68
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,033
Joe Conners?

69
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,749
No, Mr. Tomkins, not Joe Conners.

70
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,280
Then you must mean that marshal.

71
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,436
The man they call Johnny Reno.

72
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,953
Reno? Why, he used to be
one of the top gunfighters.

73
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,676
He used to be a lot of things.

74
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,157
It's Conners,
that stinking little Indian-killer.

75
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,390
Marshal, you better move on
with that prisoner of yours.

76
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,472
Send for the doctor.

77
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,352
But he can't stay here.

78
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,438
Go fetch the doc.

79
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,274
That's Ab Conners. He needs burying.

80
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,676
That figures.
But I don't want nothing to do with him.

81
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,156
As soon as he's patched up,
I want you to get him out.

82
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,598
- He'll be here for the night.
- Not in my jail.

83
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,476
You don't have any choice.

84
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,796
My people are all riled up.

85
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,277
They'll be wanting to bury him, too,
before morning.

86
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,552
You see what I mean, Reno?
They don't want me.

87
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,394
Not alive.

88
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,353
If your posse had caught up with us, Ab
and I would have been killed on sight.

89
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,557
No. I was gonna turn him over
to the authorities.

90
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,792
- You mean the Indians.
- I didn't say that.

91
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,354
Hodges.

92
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,234
This marshal giving you a bad time?

93
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,197
He wants me to lock Conners up.

94
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,919
We don't want filth like Conners
dirtying up our jail.

95
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,558
Why, sure we do.

96
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,918
Now, Marshal, since you've already
delivered your prisoner...

97
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,070
why don't you just ride on out?

98
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,391
That there is Jess Yates.
He's the Mayor of our town.

99
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,836
We'll give him a fair trial.

100
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,632
Crime against an Indian
is under government jurisdiction.

101
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,950
The trial will be in Kansas City.

102
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,158
Don't you bother none, Marshal.
We'll see that he gets to Kansas City.

103
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,272
I'll see to it.

104
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,556
We can't let that happen.

105
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,070
What are you people afraid of?

106
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,316
A corpse and a wounded man?

107
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,351
- Papa!
- I thought I told you to stay home.

108
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,790
It's the Indians we're afraid of, Marshal.

109
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,758
They find out he's here,
they'll ride in and sack the town.

110
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,910
They already know he's here.

111
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,871
You get on home and stay there.

112
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,671
Girl had the right idea.

113
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,789
That's a U.S. marshal
standing up there.

114
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,553
Time comes for us to go against the law
in this town, I'll call it.

115
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,836
Now, you do that, Mr. Yates.

116
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,357
In the meantime, you tell them that
this prisoner is in my protective custody.

117
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,317
Anybody wants to get to him...

118
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,994
is going to have to step over
my dead body.

119
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,474
- Tough customer.
- So am I.

120
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,918
We know that, Jess.

121
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,112
We've got a problem.

122
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,112
Yeah. I'd say a slight problem.

123
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,870
Yeah, that was the song that year.

124
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,354
Nobody was ever as young
as I was then.

125
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,639
Or as dumb.

126
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,237
Isn't that right, Rosie?

127
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,839
Rosie Redtoes.

128
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,710
We should know, shouldn't we?

129
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,990
You know, she was first prize
at a shooting match Reno won.

130
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,039
I was sort of a prize myself
that afternoon.

131
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,070
At least, that's what he said.

132
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,357
He was the sheriff in the town
where you lived, right?

133
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,829
Most righteous lawman you ever saw.

134
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,516
That must have been after his outlaw
days, when he hung up his guns.

135
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,431
He didn't hang them up.

136
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,990
He was given amnesty if he'd pin on
a badge and clean up a town.

137
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,231
Way I hear it,
he's been wearing a badge ever since.

138
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,794
Got carried away with a shiny tin star
and all that goes with it.

139
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,831
For that matter, so did I.

140
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,915
And that's the song they were
all singing back in those days.

141
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,796
What happened between you two?

142
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,232
I broke the law.

143
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,632
Don't laugh. I did.

144
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,111
That was the first time.

145
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,875
I helped a man escape from jail.

146
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,317
He was my brother,
and I thought he was innocent.

147
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,910
You see how dumb I was?
He wasn't innocent.

148
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,712
And after he put my father and two other
good, honest men in their graves...

149
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,154
Reno had to track him down
and kill him.

150
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,830
- Wasn't your fault.
- Yes, it was. I made a mistake.

151
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,431
I let the wrong man out.

152
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,239
I tried to tell Reno how sorry I was...

153
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,232
but I guess I didn't say it loud enough
because he didn't seem to hear me.

154
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,957
And I haven't seen him since.
Until today.

155
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,989
I would just like to know what a
U.S. marshal is doing in Stone Junction.

156
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,275
I tell you,
nobody outside this whole town...

157
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,237
even knew about this Conners mess.

158
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,878
Nobody except the Indians, that is.

159
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,552
They sure didn't send for a marshal.

160
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,710
How come he just ran into
the Conners brothers?

161
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,951
Except maybe it figures.
He was on the trail headed here.

162
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,559
But why Stone Junction?

163
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,916
There's no government business here
that needs his attention.

164
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,072
Maybe he came here
to see somebody he once knew.

165
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,195
Who?

166
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,037
No, he wouldn't.
Not after all these years.

167
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,796
- He's forgotten by now.
- You haven't.

168
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,194
If Johnny Reno does come in here
looking for me...

169
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,114
you tell him that I've left town
and you don't know where I've gone.

170
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,031
Is it that bad, Nona?

171
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,956
Please, just do as I ask.

172
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,429
And turn off that damned piano.

173
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,355
Doc says he's gonna survive
the bullet wound.

174
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,590
But I wouldn't say
how long he's gonna live.

175
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,874
I would.

176
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,878
Why? Because you're going to do
something about it?

177
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,428
I wouldn't make any bets on that.

178
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,235
Maybe you'd like odds.

179
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,029
- I mind my own business.
- This is law business.

180
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,635
You ain't got no idea
the trouble you're gonna get me into.

181
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,149
You don't back me up all the way,
you'll be in real trouble.

182
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,513
I know my job.

183
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,636
The way Mayor Yates laid it out for you?

184
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,153
I'm my own man.

185
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,196
You'd better remember to be that.

186
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,989
Even when it's unpopular,
your job is law and order.

187
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,028
Marshal, what is law, and what is order?

188
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,313
If those Indians find out
that Joe Conners is here...

189
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,038
this town's doomed.

190
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,278
I work for this town,
and all the people in it.

191
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,591
My loyalty belongs to them.

192
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,275
Your loyalty's to that badge...

193
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,716
and if you're thinking any other way,
you'd better take it off before I tear it off.

194
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,830
It's a nice town. Quiet, peaceful.

195
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,755
There ain't no crazy gunslingers
around here.

196
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,031
It was quiet and peaceful.

197
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,596
Yeah, but feelings are running high
and people are scared...

198
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,796
and I can't say I blame them.

199
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,230
Are you going to back me up?

200
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,351
I told you I know my job.

201
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,079
Is it your job?

202
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,916
That's what the rule book says.

203
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,956
I want a straight answer.

204
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,311
I'll get fired for it...

205
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,235
but there's other towns, other jobs.

206
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,471
Yeah. Sure.

207
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,352
I'll back you up.

208
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,997
I've heard that the Palace Saloon
is owned and run...

209
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,719
by a woman by the name of
Nona Williams.

210
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,231
Yeah, sure. You know her?

211
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,479
I did once.

212
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,197
I'll be over there. If there's any sign
of trouble, you send for me.

213
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,238
You bet I'll send for you. I ain't no hero.

214
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,550
I'm not making this stand alone.

215
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,955
Whatever you think you came here for,
Wooster, just forget it.

216
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,071
- Whose side are you on?
- Law and order.

217
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,557
That's real good, Sheriff.
The "order" part, I mean.

218
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,077
'Cause I just brought you an order
from Mr. Yates.

219
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,798
Give me a whiskey.

220
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,431
We don't sell it here.

221
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,794
There's something you ought to know.

222
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,591
You tell Mayor Yates
that I want a drink of whiskey.

223
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,199
Give it to him.

224
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,553
You see? I'm not an unreasonable man.

225
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,838
I don't see the owner of this saloon.

226
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,797
I don't think you're unreasonable, either.

227
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,074
Nona Williams.

228
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,636
She left town a few days ago.

229
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,436
Seems she forgot something.

230
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,715
Didn't say where she was going.

231
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,117
To show you how I feel,
I'll have a drink with you.

232
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,195
I'm particular who I drink with.

233
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,875
Jake!

234
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,116
We have respect for the law.

235
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,191
- He doesn't seem to have.
- Jake's a little edgy.

236
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,951
I'd like you to meet my friends.

237
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,510
Jake owns the general store.
Charlie here is our best bartender.

238
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,435
Ed Tomkins owns the biggest spread
in this part of the country.

239
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,114
We're willing to pay you
to get out of Stone Junction.

240
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,952
Without the prisoner.

241
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,795
Well, if I could find out why...

242
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,512
You weren't sent out
to get the Conners brothers.

243
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,592
- No, that's right, I wasn't.
- It just happened.

244
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,875
And it can just happen
that you never saw or heard of them.

245
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,398
Go back to Kansas City
and keep my mouth shut.

246
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,676
With $10,000 in your pocket.

247
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,155
A lot of money.

248
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,800
Probably more than
you'll make in a lifetime.

249
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,110
Too bad I have to turn it down.

250
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,478
You must be crazy.

251
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,469
- Nona said he was a righteous...
- Then she is here.

252
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,391
No, Reno, that was...

253
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,071
She used to talk about you.

254
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,989
- Town full of liars.
- All you gotta do is ride out.

255
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,518
Not until I find out
what's eating you people.

256
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,750
All right, I'll tell you what!

257
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,109
We're proud of this town. It's a good,
clean community, not a taint on it.

258
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,873
And it has to be that way
because this is Indian territory.

259
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,316
Word gets out that Chief Little Bear's
son was murdered on our streets...

260
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,628
our land could be confiscated.

261
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,917
Wipe us out, everything we own
and have worked for through the years.

262
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,231
That's not all. Those Indians out there
are demanding blood for blood.

263
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,630
We're sitting on a powder keg
that could blow us to hell and back.

264
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,792
You figure if you give Joe Conners
to those Indians...

265
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,077
As soon as you leave,
that's exactly what we're gonna do.

266
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,469
They're gonna get him, dead or alive.

267
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,115
I'm not leaving here
without the prisoner.

268
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,478
- Yes, you will. One way or another.
- Don't be a fool, Jake.

269
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,952
People in Kansas City know
he was headed this way.

270
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,352
If he doesn't come back,
they'll start sending out investigators.

271
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,596
Before they get through,
they could wind up sending the Army.

272
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,070
You're sure right about that, Jess.
Gotta hand it to you.

273
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,196
But you're leaving, Reno...

274
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,432
because I am personally
gonna throw you out.

275
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,196
This is my town,
and I'm willing to fight for it.

276
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,439
Aren't you afraid of what I might tell
them in Kansas City?

277
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,589
Our word against yours.

278
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,070
Now, come on, Reno,
either get out of this town or fight.

279
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,718
I'm just getting started on you,
tough boy.

280
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,150
Ain't no man alive can whip me.

281
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,473
Put that away.

282
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,275
You said there's no man alive
that could do what?

283
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,838
What happens now?

284
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,795
Now we go the other way. Tell Wooster.

285
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,791
Something's gotta work.

286
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,398
Something will.

287
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,192
Give me that doll.

288
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,197
And turn that thing off.

289
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,072
Now don't try anything else.

290
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,754
Haven't you got any respect
for this town?

291
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,439
I just lost it.

292
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,198
Papa, let me help.

293
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,709
When I need your help, I'll ask for it.

294
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,753
Looks like you had a meeting
with Mayor Yates.

295
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,228
Yeah.

296
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,393
He invited me
to get out of Stone Junction.

297
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,598
I figured that.

298
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,074
Frightened men in a frightened town.

299
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,832
I just deputised
some of those frightened men.

300
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,595
- You put rifles in their hands?
- On the orders of the Mayor.

301
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,791
You were going to back me up, not him.

302
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,791
That still goes, but I...

303
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,519
But you have a sudden need
for deputies.

304
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,114
In case the Indians come
riding into town.

305
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,714
If they're hostile Indians,
deputies won't help.

306
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,518
Everybody will have to fight.

307
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,999
What am I supposed to do?

308
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,594
Am I supposed to stand here
and hand out rifles...

309
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,591
when the firing has already started?

310
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,752
I don't think it's the Indians
Yates has in mind.

311
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,151
That's right.
He don't want to kill a U.S. marshal.

312
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,193
He may have to.

313
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,399
You think he might force your hand?

314
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,355
Nona Williams was not in the saloon.

315
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,034
She's up at that ranch house of hers.

316
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,392
That answer came awfully quick.

317
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,836
That's where she usually is
when she ain't in the saloon.

318
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,831
I was told she left town.

319
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,474
Sounds like you don't believe that.

320
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,671
Where is this ranch house?

321
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,309
It's about a mile south of town.
You can't miss it.

322
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,237
- You all right, Conners?
- Yeah.

323
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,711
Doc said I'd live.

324
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,396
Be in shape to ride tomorrow?

325
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,392
I'll be in shape.

326
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,395
I'll also be in shape to hang
when you get me to Kansas City.

327
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,594
That's better than being staked out
on an anthill...

328
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,750
with the hot sun burning down...

329
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,196
and a bunch of Indians
watching the ants eat you alive.

330
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,039
Don't you worry about a thing, Marshal.
I said I'm with you and I am.

331
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,716
All right, round up the boys.

332
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,673
Gotta hand it to you, Jess.
This is something that has to be done.

333
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,789
- Who is it?
- Reno!

334
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,832
Reno, go back where you came from.
I don't want to see you.

335
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,193
It's been a long time.
I've come a long way.

336
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,708
No, Reno, you went a long way.

337
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,751
I thought it was locked.

338
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,155
As you see, I'm not dressed.

339
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,319
I'll wait.

340
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,598
I suppose if I pretend to be modest
you'll get a big laugh out of it.

341
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,311
I never laughed before.

342
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,553
That was before. This is now.

343
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,956
The brazen saloon woman.

344
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,831
- Never tell a man your secrets.
- It's no secret.

345
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,110
I don't want to hear about it.

346
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,471
With my father and brother both dead...

347
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,358
how was I supposed to get along
after you left?

348
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,195
- You had the ranch.
- Sure, mortgaged to the teeth.

349
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,357
You had relatives back East.

350
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,592
A cousin in Boston
who never answered my letters.

351
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,588
It's no good arguing about that now.

352
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,714
I had you.

353
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,996
- I walked out.
- "Ran" is a better word.

354
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,839
The last good hope
I had on Earth was you.

355
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,232
We both got hurt.

356
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,550
Because I made a mistake,
and you couldn't forgive me.

357
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,877
Here, give me a hand.

358
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,514
I see you found Rosie Redtoes.

359
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,680
Yeah, I thought I'd lost her for good.

360
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,119
You have, Reno.

361
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,310
It's been a long time
since I've helped a woman dress.

362
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,510
You bragging or complaining?

363
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,358
- I don't like that kind of talk.
- Saloon talk.

364
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,516
You see, I made out just fine.

365
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,633
I own that saloon,
lock, stock, and barrel.

366
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,518
I even own this old ramshackle
ranch house.

367
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,917
And what did it cost?

368
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,270
How shall I add it up?
In dollars or customers?

369
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,714
- Stop it.
- What's the matter?

370
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,473
I'm not the same Nona
you came looking for.

371
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,518
- I'm not the same, either.
- Yes, you are.

372
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,709
Righteous Reno, the reformed killer...

373
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,112
atoning for all the gravestones that
used to spring up wherever he went.

374
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,829
If I'd had any idea
that you were still as bitter as this...

375
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,595
Here we are, face to face.
The saint and the sinner.

376
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,312
You in your halo
and me in my pretty red garters.

377
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,069
...or that you hated me this much...

378
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,915
Why did you come looking for me?

379
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,555
Last time I forgot to say goodbye.

380
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,399
Goodbye, Reno.

381
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,269
Freeze, mister! You ain't going
nowhere. Get your hands up.

382
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,311
That was real touching.

383
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,512
Wooster, what are you and Bellows
doing in here?

384
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,030
You didn't know they were here?

385
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,795
I'm not in the habit of taking a bath
in front of a couple of peeping Toms.

386
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,472
We want him, not you.

387
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,633
Just wanna keep him busy till we send
Conners' body to the Indians.

388
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,156
- The Indians want him alive.
- We want him dead.

389
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,310
Then it wasn't true
that Yates intended to turn him over.

390
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,833
Just a nice, cold corpse.

391
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,270
- Now it begins to add up.
- What does?

392
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,191
The stink in this town.

393
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,752
You'd be better off
minding your own business.

394
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,199
Joe Conners told me he and his brother
were innocent. I didn't believe him.

395
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,917
But even if I had...

396
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,756
I would probably have made a speech
about a fair trial.

397
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,796
Those Conners boys didn't have
any reason to kill that Indian.

398
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,394
Everybody in town knew Ed Little Bear.

399
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,112
Did you see Ed Little Bear killed?

400
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,874
- No.
- Way it figures...

401
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,919
they want Joe Conners dead because
he might tell what really happened.

402
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,073
He ain't gonna tell nobody nothing.
Not with a rope around his neck.

403
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,880
And right about now
they're hanging him.

404
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,278
If you're gonna stop that lynching,
you better hurry.

405
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,512
I'll be all right. There's a back door
to the Sheriff's office. Go on.

406
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,311
I forgot to say hello.

407
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,478
I say let's string him up
and get it over with.

408
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,434
I still don't like it.
You know, the marshal...

409
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,829
We know he won't be here,
don't we, men?

410
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,390
All right, I guess there ain't no use
for me to stand in your way.

411
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,392
- Then bring him out here.
- No, I ain't gonna do that.

412
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,109
- I ain't gonna give him to you now.
- Then we're going in after him.

413
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,591
You drop those keys.

414
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,435
Any other man want these keys,
just step right up.

415
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,876
- Marshal, I didn't expect you...
- No, you sure didn't.

416
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,238
- I couldn't face them all alone.
- You didn't try. Drop that rifle!

417
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,154
All right, Sheriff, collect those rifles
you issued a while ago.

418
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,748
Yes, sir.

419
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,237
You're a stranger here, Reno.
Leave this to us.

420
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,916
I leave a lynching to nobody.

421
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,879
- Joe Conners is not your worry.
- No, he's yours.

422
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,839
Now go ahead
and tell these people why.

423
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,075
Mister, do you want that rifle or do you
want a hole in the head? Drop it.

424
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,230
The rest of you do the same.

425
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,110
- He's bluffing. Pick up your guns.
- He don't bluff.

426
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,114
Pick up your guns!

427
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,397
If any one of you picks up a gun,
Mr. Reed is dead.

428
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,869
You wouldn't do that.
I'm not even armed.

429
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,670
Neither is Conners in that jail cell.
Go ahead, maybe they didn't hear you.

430
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,390
Tell them to pick up their rifles.

431
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,794
What are we supposed to do
if the Indians should ride in?

432
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,713
You should have thought of that
before you ordered a lynching.

433
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,518
I didn't order a lynching.

434
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,559
Where is Yates?

435
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,029
He and Duggan and Tomkins
are over at the...

436
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,112
It wouldn't look so good
for the leading citizens of the town...

437
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,193
to help in the lynching. If a mob does it,
nobody gets any blame.

438
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,711
You haven't heard the last of this, Reno.

439
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,791
Or maybe they didn't want to
take a chance...

440
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,677
of being shot down on the street.

441
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,436
You go tell His Honour, the Mayor,
there's not going to be any lynching.

442
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,838
You decoyed me.

443
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,357
Oh, no, the Mayor said that...

444
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,637
You sent me out to that ranch house
to sit out a lynching.

445
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,996
I expected it'd all be over with
before you'd come back.

446
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,748
Or that Wooster and his friend
would kill me.

447
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,310
They were only supposed to hold you
out there for a while.

448
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,074
They won't be holding
anybody anymore.

449
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,117
You better send somebody out
to pick up their bodies.

450
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,239
Marshal, you gotta listen to me.
I'm glad there wasn't a hanging...

451
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,353
but everybody told me that
this was the best way out for both of us.

452
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,435
We're going to need outside help.

453
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,230
There ain't no telegraph office
in this town. Never was.

454
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,999
That figures.

455
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,235
Now, I want you to tell me something.

456
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,993
Ed Little Bear, who killed him?

457
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,029
Why, the Conners brothers, of course.
Everybody knows that.

458
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,836
Joe Conners told me different.

459
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,194
Oh, I know. You've heard that before.

460
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,915
Sure. Every guilty man
I've ever had in here...

461
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,355
said the same thing: "I'm innocent."

462
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,477
Maybe some of them were.

463
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,118
I hear that Ed Little Bear was welcome
in this town.

464
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,636
Why, sure.
He was a nice, educated young Indian.

465
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,910
And when he was murdered
for no reason...

466
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,956
I think there was a reason.

467
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,518
Marshal, I don't know
what you're getting at.

468
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,470
But whatever it is, believe me,
I don't know about it.

469
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,154
- You lie pretty good.
- I ain't lying!

470
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,599
That's all you've done since I got here.

471
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,829
But you can believe me this time.

472
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,838
A man's gotta live with
his own conscience.

473
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,679
If this town's hiding something,
I want to know what it is.

474
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,355
A big, rotten stench,
and you didn't smell anything?

475
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,469
You know, it is kind of curious...

476
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,595
they're so anxious to have Conners
dead and buried so quick.

477
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,714
- But I thought that...
- They were just riled up.

478
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,031
Yeah, it's like I said before,
they're just riled up.

479
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,478
You think I can trust you to just sit here
and not issue any more rifles?

480
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,475
- You have my word.
- I had your word before.

481
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,476
They want any more rifles,
they'll have to kill me.

482
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,349
They won't. I will.

483
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,038
Sun's going down.

484
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,037
It'll be a long night.

485
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,951
If you want to live through it, Reno,
forget me and get out of this town fast.

486
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,834
No chance.

487
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,676
You heard that lynch mob out there.

488
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,436
It's no good, they'll be back.

489
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,309
One way or another they'll get me.

490
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,796
If they want to try it again...

491
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,517
You can't fight a whole town
single-handed, Reno.

492
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,796
There's something else I can't do:
run away.

493
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,029
You don't and they'll get you, too.

494
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,598
You said you and your brother
were innocent.

495
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,315
Shouted until I was blue in the face,
and nobody would listen.

496
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,119
Including me.

497
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,672
You listening now?

498
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,632
I'm listening now.

499
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,037
What made you decide to?

500
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,594
This town.

501
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,152
I never thought
anybody would ever listen.

502
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,511
The way it happened,
I can hardly believe it myself.

503
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,634
And I know we didn't kill that Indian.

504
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,071
We came riding into Stone Junction
minding our own business...

505
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,595
and everybody was real friendly.

506
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,196
Real friendly. Why, over at the saloon,
we couldn't even buy a drink.

507
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,555
They just kept buying them for us.

508
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,516
This town isn't that friendly.

509
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,872
And then finally somebody reminded us
that we'd left our horses out front.

510
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,070
That was thoughtful of them.

511
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,756
So we decided to take them over
to the livery stable...

512
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,548
got about a block or so...

513
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,153
and there was this Indian
riding toward us...

514
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,754
and then, all of a sudden,
there was a whole bunch of shooting...

515
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,469
and the next thing I knew
the Indian was off his horse...

516
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,519
and lying there, dead.

517
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,952
Who fired the shots?

518
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,516
We didn't see anybody firing.
They just came from all over.

519
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,110
And then everybody started crowding
around us, saying we killed him.

520
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,032
- For no reason?
- Oh, yeah, they gave us a reason.

521
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,512
They said our being drunk and all,
and seeing an Indian had spooked us.

522
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,838
But that was no painted savage.
And we weren't scared.

523
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,319
Besides, afterwards
Ab said it looked like...

524
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,871
it was already a dead man
propped up in that saddle.

525
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,278
Nobody would listen.

526
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,232
And then there was that woman
that kept screaming.

527
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,592
- You ever seen her before?
- No.

528
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,593
But she was the one that was out there
on the street when you brought me in.

529
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,194
How did you and your brother get away?

530
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,951
While she was screaming
and carrying on...

531
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,031
and everybody was trying to
quiet her down...

532
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,918
we just rode hell-bent right out of town.

533
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,478
Good thing you did.

534
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,398
They got word to the Indians
that we did it.

535
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,916
Even so, way it figures...

536
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,192
they didn't really want those Indians
to find you.

537
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,352
Yeah, they had their own posse out
looking for us.

538
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,075
They probably sent Chief Little Bear...

539
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,038
off on a wild-goose chase
in some other direction.

540
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,433
- But why?
- To keep you from talking.

541
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,960
Indians wouldn't have believed
me or Ab.

542
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,837
Maybe they would have.

543
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,753
A story that far-fetched?
Not without some reason.

544
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,631
Maybe there is a reason.

545
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,748
Doesn't make much difference no more.

546
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,552
But like I said, Reno, you stay here...

547
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,876
we'll both be dead in the morning.

548
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,072
Marshal, there's something going on
in the street.

549
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,673
Like I said, Conners,
I'm not running away.

550
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,670
You keep an eye on the prisoner.

551
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,833
It won't be long, Molly.
We'll send for you.

552
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,516
- Papa, I don't want to go.
- I don't care what you want.

553
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,558
And you never have,
not once since Ma died.

554
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,269
Trying to embarrass me in front of
these people here? I'm gonna...

555
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,639
I don't care what you say,
you're going along with the rest.

556
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,996
You're not telling me what to do.
I've got roots here. Tell him, Reno.

557
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,753
Maybe somebody would like to tell me
what this is all about.

558
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,035
He says the Indians are coming in
from the South...

559
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,634
and they're sending people up North
to the abandoned fort.

560
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,712
We just got definite word
that the Indians will be here by morning.

561
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,997
I can guarantee you there'll be hell
to pay. We know Chief Little Bear.

562
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,149
So do I.

563
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,038
You want to see women
and children massacred?

564
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,636
He claims that he and these other big,
brave men are gonna stay here to fight.

565
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,238
They're not that big
and they're not that brave.

566
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,473
Reno, why don't you stop
meddling in our business?

567
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,836
Why don't you stop meddling in hers?
If she wants to stay, she stays.

568
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,515
- Leave me alone.
- Now, look.

569
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,870
We've had enough grief because of you.
Now you get out of here.

570
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,794
All right, Papa.
I'll go, and I'll keep right on going.

571
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,558
You've been having
a lot of trouble with her.

572
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,429
My daughter is no concern of yours.

573
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,590
Or is she always that skittish?

574
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,518
Like the night Ed Little Bear
was murdered.

575
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,911
You ever say anything like that again,
I'll kill you.

576
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,035
I hear she stood on the street,
screaming.

577
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,111
You've got the facts all wrong.

578
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,877
You look like somebody stepped
on your sore toes.

579
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,518
I told you, I'll kill you.

580
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,709
I've never seen him that mad before.

581
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,756
I think he has good reason.

582
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,794
- The caravan left without you.
- I've got a saloon to run.

583
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,149
I think I should have let you go.

584
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,590
Just when I finally got you
in the same town again?

585
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,353
The men that stayed on here have
a guilt they're sitting on...

586
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,228
and I think they'll kill anybody,
man or woman, who finds out what it is.

587
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,029
- Then it's not the Indians?
- No, the Indians, too.

588
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,354
This town has got a lot to worry about.

589
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,031
Johnny, you're scaring me.

590
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,111
Like Joe Conners said,
it'll be a long night.

591
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,119
You took a chance
going out there, Reno.

592
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,880
Looked like a ghost town out there.

593
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,958
Yeah, but Yates ain't gonna give up
this easy.

594
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,591
Lot of men kill Indians,
don't think anything about it.

595
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,151
John Wesley Hardin brags
he's killed 35 men, not counting Indians.

596
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,870
- Doesn't even count them.
- Nobody does.

597
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,229
- But a U.S. marshal.
- It has to be, Jess.

598
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,275
Yeah. It has to be.

599
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,838
I've never seen Mr. Yates drink
that much before.

600
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,598
He'll be all right tomorrow.
We all will. The whole town.

601
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,959
Now look,
if we put snipers on rooftops...

602
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,076
in between buildings,
all over the place...

603
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,072
It's no use, Jess.
Reno won't come out tonight.

604
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,994
Maybe there's a way of getting him out.

605
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,632
Don't look at me.

606
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,635
What are you getting at, Jess?

607
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,188
A way of baiting Reno onto the street.

608
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,750
If you think you can kill Reno...

609
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,239
The lady's got big ears.

610
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,880
I understand you and Reno
used to be very cosy.

611
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,678
He wouldn't stick his neck out for me.

612
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,749
Why not?

613
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,594
You stuck yours out for him by
staying behind when all the others left.

614
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,875
- It wasn't for him.
- Yes, it was.

615
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,872
You wanted to be sure
you didn't lose track of him again.

616
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,155
Jess, there's a song on that piano...

617
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,312
that kind of goes with the way
she feels about Reno.

618
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,118
You keep out of this.

619
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,719
Now, maybe he feels
the same way about it.

620
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,236
He must. He came all the way
from Kansas City to see her.

621
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,674
Real quiet out on the street tonight.

622
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,355
Maybe if we turn that piano up
loud enough, he'll hear it.

623
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,149
Seems like I'm right.
She's afraid he'll hear it.

624
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,670
Only that's not all he's gonna hear.

625
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,558
He's gonna hear
her screaming her head off!

626
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,710
- Got to hand it to you, Jess.
- Quit handing things to me!

627
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,712
Like I said before, men up on the
rooftops, in between the buildings...

628
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,357
when Reno comes out onto the street,
start blasting.

629
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,113
You heard him. Outside.
Rest of you out back.

630
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,031
Get that music roll back into the piano!

631
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,832
You start screaming.

632
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,150
Nothing you can do
will make me scream.

633
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,958
Scream or I'm gonna kill you!

634
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,234
Go ahead!

635
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,111
Don't go out there, Reno!

636
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,073
All the other women left,
and I let her stay.

637
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,235
They'll blast your head off. They kill you,
I won't be any good around here alone.

638
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,115
They kill her,
I won't be any good for anything.

639
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,477
You ever see a bullet come
straight at your face?

640
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,194
If Joe Conners is innocent,
like you say...

641
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,748
it's your job to stay here
and protect him.

642
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,951
You still ain't scaring me.

643
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,194
Cover me.

644
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,669
Reno must be out there somewhere.

645
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,633
They got him.

646
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,315
That isn't Reno.
Looks like Sheriff Hodges.

647
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,272
Don't make me laugh.

648
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,440
When the shooting starts,
Hodges hides.

649
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,431
I told you that was Hodges.

650
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,834
I didn't think he had the sand for it.

651
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,671
You never know about a man.

652
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,989
Sheriff's office. Back way.

653
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,477
Thank God, you're all right.

654
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,278
I'll say amen to that.

655
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,671
Get him a gun and bring the keys.

656
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,876
You must believe what I told you is true.

657
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,076
This is one way of finding out.

658
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,838
Where's the Sheriff?

659
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,156
He set himself up. For me.

660
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,591
Or maybe it was for you.

661
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,515
Here.

662
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,278
Watch that door.
Shoot anybody who tries to come in.

663
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,793
Be a pleasure.

664
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,597
Light's out. He made it.

665
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,316
You can't stand them off forever.

666
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,799
I can try.

667
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,753
About the guilt this town had,
you're right.

668
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,030
But as for the Conners brothers,
I was wrong.

669
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,919
I made a mistake.

670
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,352
You mean, like I did?

671
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,196
I thought they were guilty.

672
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,397
And at the time,
I thought my brother was innocent.

673
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,310
It only proves you're human.

674
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,989
That's something you never believed.

675
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,192
You never let me.

676
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,911
You'll never forget
that I wouldn't listen, will you?

677
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,593
It's forgotten.

678
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,156
I never should have left you.

679
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,674
Just be sure you don't ever leave again.

680
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,154
For now, you're going to have to leave.

681
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,674
Without you?

682
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,910
I'd never stand a chance of making it
out of here with Joe Conners.

683
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,672
- They'd run us down...
- Well, but...

684
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,069
But for you, they wouldn't even know
you were gone.

685
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,277
- Then go without him.
- It doesn't work that way.

686
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,718
Still the shiniest tin badge
in the territory.

687
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,549
Some things just don't ever change.

688
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,270
If you don't go, I'm not going, either.

689
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,955
I want you to go to the closest
telegraph office and send for help.

690
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,792
Help would never get here in time.

691
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,155
There's not more than a dozen men
left in this town.

692
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,753
I might be able to hold them off...

693
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,832
Hold them off for how long?
A few days, a week?

694
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,999
Nona, you're the only chance I have.

695
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,758
I don't believe that for one minute.
Neither do you.

696
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,275
But if it means that much to you,
that you'd lie...

697
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,437
find an excuse to get me away
where I'll be safe...

698
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,078
Don't start crying.

699
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,990
Just when I thought I'd stopped.

700
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,590
Maybe we can slip out the back way
to the livery stable.

701
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,193
I'll slip out the back way
to the livery stable.

702
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,397
- I can hitch up a horse and a buggy.
- You can't go out there alone.

703
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,870
But you can stay here alone, can't you?
You and Joe Conners.

704
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,350
Those men with the torches,
they're not going to the livery stable...

705
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,112
they're coming here.

706
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,233
I'll telegraph from the first place I reach.

707
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,834
Nona, if anything happened
to you now...

708
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,872
Nothing will happen to me.
Nothing ever has.

709
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,151
He's expecting company.

710
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,673
What company?

711
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,238
Looks like they're gonna try to
burn us out.

712
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,478
- Let's make a run for it.
- You tried running once.

713
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,915
- You got any better ideas?
- I might.

714
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,675
That should do it.

715
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,638
Jake said he'd be back
in a couple of minutes.

716
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,311
Jess, if I'd known
what you were getting us into...

717
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,910
I told you to shut up about that.

718
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,515
You said that if we'd be a party
to killing Ed Little Bear...

719
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,717
it would be a favour to humanity.
That's what you said, Jess.

720
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,837
You've been leading us around
like we had a ring through our nose.

721
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,353
I'm telling you, Ed, shut up!

722
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,318
Wasn't my daughter got mixed up
with an Indian.

723
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,276
Now, you'll do as I tell you!

724
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,998
I always have, Jess.
All of us always have.

725
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,875
Jess, here's the kerosene.
Come on, let's go.

726
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,672
That's far enough!

727
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,438
Any closer and I'll blow you
to kingdom come.

728
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,793
It's dynamite.

729
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,033
I'm glad your aim
wasn't that good yesterday.

730
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,156
- I'll keep watch back here.
- All right.

731
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,028
- How long can we hold out?
- As long as our luck holds.

732
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,515
I've never been very lucky, Reno.

733
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,070
Don't expect I will be tonight.

734
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,594
What, somebody bust in?

735
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,989
And busted right out again.
Come on, give me a hand.

736
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,196
Let's get this desk up there.

737
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,869
He's killing us off, Jess.
One by one, he's killing us off.

738
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,431
Open your bellyaching mouth once
more, I'll kill you off myself, personally.

739
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,193
All right, Jess.

740
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,791
Tomkins!

741
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,520
- You running out, too?
- I need a drink.

742
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,356
What are they waiting for?

743
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,672
Us. To make a mistake.

744
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,109
Mistake I made was being born.

745
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,592
They still out there?

746
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,313
All around us.

747
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,478
Make a break for it, Reno,
before it's too late.

748
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,229
They won't ride out after you.
Isn't you they want.

749
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,599
Don't be so anxious to die.

750
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,309
What makes you so anxious?

751
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,829
Just don't want nobody dying useless,
and on account of me.

752
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,193
Sorry, Reno.

753
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,591
Just let me for once...

754
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,790
do something in my mangy life.

755
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,550
This is Joe Conners!

756
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,273
If I come out of here with my hands up...

757
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,997
will you let Reno ride out
free and clear?

758
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,479
- Maybe it's a trick.
- Maybe. Let's find out.

759
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,152
All right, Conners.

760
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,751
Tell him he can ride out
if he leaves here peaceful.

761
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,549
- He sticks his nose out of there...
- Not until we have Reno.

762
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,990
All right, hold your fire, men!

763
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,118
Now, you tell Reno
we're getting him a horse.

764
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,192
No, you tell him.

765
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,956
You tell him he can go home.

766
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,752
Now, all I want...

767
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,799
is that somebody
in this rotten town gets to leave.

768
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,873
Where is Reno?

769
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,198
He wouldn't let me give myself up,
so I took things in my own hands.

770
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,029
What's the matter with you people?

771
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,796
I thought all you wanted to do
was to kill me on sight.

772
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,551
Come on, kill me!

773
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,235
Come on, you yellow jackals, kill me!

774
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,152
I'm here, here where you want me.

775
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,429
They swore they'd let you go, Reno.

776
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,714
- You got the honours, Jess, kill them.
- Oh, no.

777
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,791
The honours aren't done that way
in this town.

778
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,915
Kill them!

779
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,150
You ought to know that by now,
all of you.

780
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,312
- You've got to kill them.
- We've got to kill them.

781
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,358
Just the same as it was
with Ed Little Bear.

782
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,910
We're all going to be in on this.

783
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,678
You've got a whole town
to do your dirty work.

784
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,553
Everything was all right
until you came along.

785
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,552
Sure, you put the blame on a couple of...

786
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,756
Saddle tramps, drifters.

787
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,636
And you wanted to be sure
those drifters were good and dead...

788
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,518
so they couldn't tell the Chief
they didn't do it.

789
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,434
Because Chief Little Bear knew
his son was seeing your daughter...

790
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,034
and he might believe
the Conners brothers.

791
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,079
I don't care about a dead Indian
or a couple of dead saddle tramps.

792
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,314
You're a different thing,
you're a U.S. marshal.

793
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,197
But you forced my hand.

794
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,913
Who's gonna get the blame
for killing Reno?

795
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,353
You are, bucko. You killed a
U.S. marshal while trying to escape.

796
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,908
And no one's ever
gonna know the difference.

797
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,754
So that's why you sent the women
and children and old men away.

798
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,512
That's right, Reno.

799
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,798
They won't see,
or ever even know about it.

800
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,310
And after you're dead and buried,
this'll be a nice, clean town again.

801
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,277
A good, model community.

802
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,919
When I give the signal, each of us fires.

803
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,276
We've got the prisoner,
Chief Little Bear.

804
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,316
We were holding him for you.

805
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,312
I told them, Jess, the truth.

806
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:51,918
You did it. You made us kill his son.

807
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,279
You're crazy!

808
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,273
Because you were once married
to an Indian woman.

809
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,268
You didn't think I knew that, did you?

810
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,510
You were a squaw man
and trying to live it down.

811
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,670
He's talking out-of-his-mind.

812
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:14,468
And then an Indian fell in love
with your daughter...

813
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,876
and you could see the whole thing
starting over again.

814
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,993
I caught up with them
less than an hour ago.

815
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,308
Murderer!

816
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,993
- He didn't kill Ed Little Bear.
- But everybody said...

817
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,036
Everybody lied.

818
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,837
- But my father...
- Your father lied most of all.

819
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,197
I'm sorry, young lady.

820
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,319
All you people can go back now,
go back to Stone Junction...

821
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,509
what's left of it, bury your dead.

822
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,838
In time, perhaps
it'll become a town again.

823
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,312
I wish you all good luck
in your new community.

824
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,156
They will make a town of it,
one they can be proud of.

825
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,390
Nona? You're not coming back?

826
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,709
Am I?

827
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,276
No, we won't be coming back.
