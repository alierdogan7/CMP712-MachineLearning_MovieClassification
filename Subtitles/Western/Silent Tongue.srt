00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,242
Come on.

Come on.

5
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,801
Come on.

6
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,319
Come on.

7
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:37,246
Go! Get!

8
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:58,344
Allez oop!
Allez oop!

9
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:08,471
Nice little place
you got here.

10
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:12,007
Kind of lonesome, but
it's nice just the same.

11
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:15,027
Yeah. I got me
this place rent-free.

12
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:16,946
Government couldn't
<i>give</i> it away!

13
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:18,548
How's that?

14
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:20,366
On account of
it's haunted.

15
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,501
Oh, I ain't afraid
of no ghost.

16
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:24,153
That's good,
because they're liable

17
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:26,956
to come wafting in and out
of here any old time.

18
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:28,524
You actually, uh...

19
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:29,992
I mean, you've seen
them wafting?

20
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:31,510
Yeah, I've seen
them wafting.

21
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:32,995
But you don't got to
fret yourself none.

22
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:34,547
All I do is sing
my ghost song

23
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:35,931
and they scat...

24
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,984
Like a scalded dog.

25
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:40,903
How does
that song go

26
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:42,621
j-just in case
I need it?

27
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:44,791
Goes like this here.

28
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,996

hey! Where you going?

49
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:02,001
You got to teach me
that song!

50
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:05,787
I don't know that song.
You got to teach it to me.

51
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:09,008
You seen that fellow
who was here?

52
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:11,544
That fellow
with the, uh...Hey!

53
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:14,513
You got to
teach me that song!

54
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,031
Look behind you!

55
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:18,067
Aah!

56
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:38,687
Folks, you have been
very kind and receptive

57
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:40,389
to our little presentation
here today.

58
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,023
Just on account of that,

59
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:44,693
we've got a special surprise
in store for you all.

60
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,762
We don't usually like
to bring her forth

61
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:48,014
in front of so many folks

62
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,065
on account of
her terrible shyness.

63
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:52,300
Now, if you folks don't mind
bunching up a bit there,

64
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,754
she needs plenty of room
for this act.

65
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:58,741
Allow some room and I guarantee
you won't be disappointed.

66
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:01,310
Now get ready for some of
the wildest horsebacking

67
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,595
you're ever likely to see
this side of the brazos.

68
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:09,401
Miss Velada McCree,
the Kiowa warrior princess!

69
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,201
There was a young man
from Siam,

70
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:51,787
who said, "I go
in with a wham!

71
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:53,672
"While I soon lose
my starch

72
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:55,357
"like the mad month
of march

73
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:58,077
and the lion comes out
like a lamb."

74
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,979
Ha ha ha!
Hey! Off you go!

75
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,617
Guess who's come.

76
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:07,169
Who's come?

77
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,522
Hmm...Hmm!
Shem the sham

78
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,541
or the fairy frog,
perhaps.

79
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,693
That horse swapper.

80
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:15,077
Horse swapper?
What horse swapper?

81
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:18,064
The one you swapped
awbonnie for.

82
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:21,433
Ah, yes.
<i>That</i> horse swapper.

83
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:22,968
He's come back.

84
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,520
So he's come back.

85
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:26,305
Help me up out of
the bog, would you,

86
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:29,024
like a true son would
aid an ailing father.

87
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:31,243
Ow! Aah! Ha!

88
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,045
What's he
come back for?

89
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,480
How in the name of
Seamus should I know?

90
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:38,150
Hey, do you take me
for a geomancer?

91
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:41,036
What if he's come for
his horses and his loot?

92
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:42,954
We ate his horses
outside Omaha,

93
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:44,557
or did we forget
the hard times?

94
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,275
They couldn't run
a lick anyhow,

95
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:47,959
miserable snides!
Ha ha!

96
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,828
Maybe awbonnie ran off
on him or something.

97
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,580
She hated being
traded like that.

98
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,683
I knew we were gonna
have to pay for this!

99
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,884
Oh, you should've
been born a female

100
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:57,135
the way you whine
and whimper.

101
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:59,254
Now, get me to
the bloody stage!

102
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:02,240
We got tonic to sell,
miracles to perform.

103
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:05,811
The whole prairie is
festering for our remedy!

104
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,699
Now, good people
of the open plain,

105
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,869
may I have
your attention, please?

106
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,437
Please,
come in closer, now.

107
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:51,390
Now, before we reach
our grand finale,

108
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:52,708
I would like
to introduce to you

109
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:55,311
the man who's responsible
for our little pilgrimage

110
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,012
into your
forgotten territory...

111
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,882
That horse swapper couldn't
outrun their own feed bill!

112
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:02,534
That's right, folks!
None other than my father,

113
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,537
doctor and Professor
emeritus

114
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,055
of herbal
prairie medicine,

115
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:08,723
the honorable
eamon monachain McCree!

116
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,543
Hey! Ha!

117
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:14,013
Miserable prairie vermin.

118
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:15,197
Ha!

119
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,572
Fair people
of the raging wind,

120
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:28,510
have you ever fallen
into a terrible fever

121
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:31,129
or ever known one who has?

122
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,298
Not the fever of the lovesick
or the forlorn or the cowardly,

123
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,300
yearning for the hearth
of a new england home,

124
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:38,170
but a real burnin' fever--

125
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:43,041
a fever of the demon prairie
and all its attendant ills?

126
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,645
Well, I was cast into the eye
of just such a fever

127
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:49,581
as a wee lad myself,
not more than a day's ride

128
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:52,150
from the very soil
on which we now stand...

129
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:54,520
Surrounded by
my primitive captors--

130
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:57,022
painted faces,

131
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,008
bodies greased in the fat
of the bearded Buffalo...

132
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,696
A language unknown to me,
being a native son of Erin...

133
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:06,831
A language...

134
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:09,951
Of the spirit world.

135
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,575
And then...

136
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:21,597
A vision appeared
to my raw, young mind.

137
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:24,500
Two eyes like the eyes
of a red-tailed hawk,

138
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,402
teeth like a prairie wolf.

139
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:32,090
It hung above me face
in a twirling specter!

140
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,509
And then...

141
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:39,981
And then
it spoke its name.

142
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:45,387
This was indeed a man
and not an apparition--

143
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:47,238
an authentic medicine man

144
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,091
from the dreaded
kiowa-comanche nation!

145
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:51,744
What he was about
to share with me

146
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:53,262
was a sacred secret

147
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:57,499
no white man
has ever been made privy to.

148
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,986
A secret which I have brought

149
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:04,122
here with me today

150
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:08,544
to share with each
and every one of you--

151
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:12,330
the ancient sagwa serum

152
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,533
stolen from the kickapoo.

153
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:17,368
It saved me from
the valley of the shadow,

154
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:22,040
ladies and gentlemen,
just as it can save you.

155
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,176
Even with
our limited supply,

156
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:27,212
I am prepared to make
an exceptional offer here today.

157
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,715
The first bottle
of our tonic is free,

158
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:32,568
together with a dollar
purchase of the second.

159
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:34,053
That is two bottles
for the price of one.

160
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,337
And we guarantee
your money back

161
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:39,108
if you aren't
completely satisfied.

162
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,376
Now, when I tell you

163
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:45,063
that kickapoo sagwa is
a miracle of medical knowledge,

164
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:47,466
I'm not just tooting my pipe.

165
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,935
Say the malady
is unknown to you.

166
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,886
It hasn't got a name.

167
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,690
It's just a feeling
of malaise

168
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:57,125
in the blood of the brain.

169
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:59,978
You take a small tin cupful...

170
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,732
Or straight from the bottle.

171
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,434
You just take it
straight down

172
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,871
and reap
the wonderful benefits.

173
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,957
You'll feel...A glow...

174
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,460
A glow of health.

175
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:18,914
Health and well-being
move through your blood

176
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:22,301
right down
to your very core.

177
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:27,889
Thank you very much.

178
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,049
You bastard!

179
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,052
Ha! Bastard.

180
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:32,987
Bastard! Oh, yes.

181
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,501
Oh!

182
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:15,113
Ah, yes!

183
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:18,167
The horse swapper.

184
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:21,035
I heard you were
paying us another call.

185
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:24,606
Prescott, wasn't it?

186
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:25,990
Prescott
something.

187
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:29,061
You have a stout
memory, sir.

188
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:32,614
Roe! Prescott roe!
That's it!

189
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:35,600
It's the Irish rings
a bell with me.

190
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,619
I never forget
a kinsman,

191
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,104
not in this
forsaken desert.

192
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:41,406
Even those that
barge right in.

193
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,575
Forgive me, sir.

194
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:47,112
Not a word of it.
I've grown accustomed

195
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:48,863
to the primitive
for some time.

196
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,215
In fact,
I prefer it by now.

197
00:19:50,216 --> 00:19:52,484
It's the primitive that
feeds my livelihood.

198
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:53,702
Drink?

199
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:56,354
Thank you, no.

200
00:19:58,007 --> 00:19:59,991
Never partake
of the jar.

201
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,978
I remember
that as well!

202
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:04,329
Ha ha!

203
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,432
A restraint
I hold no envy for.

204
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,188
Ah, well. Set your
bones down, then.

205
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,944
Ha ha! There.

206
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:30,372
How's
my daughter, then?

207
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:33,308
Did she serve your
backwards son well?

208
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,963
She's...

209
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,551
She's passed.

210
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:47,088
Well...

211
00:20:52,478 --> 00:20:54,846
A deal's a deal
after all.

212
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:00,485
She was healthy when
we made the swap...

213
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:04,122
Far healthier than
your son, by all accounts.

214
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,727
I can't very well return
the horses now, anyway.

215
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,230
It's been a year or more.
Poor excuse for horseflesh--

216
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:14,833
I don't want
the horses.

217
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:18,236
It's not your fault
that she died.

218
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,271
It happened
in childbirth,

219
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:22,257
and...

220
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:25,911
The child
went with her.

221
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:29,831
I see.

222
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:36,688
Well.

223
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:41,759
There's no way
to account

224
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,762
for the trauma
of birth,

225
00:21:43,763 --> 00:21:45,280
is there, now?

226
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:48,216
That's one I never
got over meself.

227
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:53,772
Well,
what is it then, eh?

228
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:55,774
How are we, uh...

229
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:59,144
Honored by
your sudden visit?

230
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,214
It's my son.

231
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:09,304
He's taken
a terrible grief over her.

232
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:13,241
He's fallen even deeper
inside himself.

233
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:17,346
Weeks now...

234
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:23,869
He refuses
to eat, speak.

235
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,253
He just...

236
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:35,297
He just stands
over her corpse

237
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:37,248
like a lost soul.

238
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:43,338
Watching,
speaking tongues, guarding,

239
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:48,759
as though she were
still in the world.

240
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:52,880
Well, he'll soon get
over that business.

241
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:55,283
You know how
the heart goes.

242
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:57,518
Give him time.

243
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,989
After all, 'twas
only his first wife.

244
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,642
He won't get over it.
He'll perish.

245
00:23:04,643 --> 00:23:07,228
He was well on that road
before he met my daughter,

246
00:23:07,229 --> 00:23:09,197
if I remember your
description correctly.

247
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:13,551
He's worse now.
His mind is...

248
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:15,353
It's completely gone.

249
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,074
I still fail to see

250
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:22,560
the object of your
return, Mr. roe.

251
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:26,080
Insanity is
beyond my domain.

252
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,367
I restrict myself
to the physical woes.

253
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,703
Your second daughter.

254
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:34,038
I wish to purchase
your second daughter

255
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,690
at the same exchange.

256
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:39,010
She may distract him
from this endless mourning.

257
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:41,963
It's the only chance
I have to save my son.

258
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:44,098
I brought
three sound mounts,

259
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,601
well broken to saddle
and to pack.

260
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:49,203
I have them hobbled there
on the top of the rise yonder.

261
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:52,774
I'm not a bottomless pit
of daughters, Mr. roe.

262
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:54,409
I've only one left now
apparently.

263
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,744
My son will die
without her.

264
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:58,279
He's close
to it now.

265
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,563
She draws the crowds
like flies now

266
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,715
with her pony act.

267
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:02,200
She's our
main attraction.

268
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:04,835
I'll throw in
extra.

269
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:08,606
What extra? We got
livestock aplenty.

270
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:11,376
I don't need more horses

271
00:24:11,377 --> 00:24:13,110
that can't get
out of their own way.

272
00:24:13,111 --> 00:24:15,113
Coin.

273
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,235
Cash, then.

274
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,555
The melody rises.

275
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:32,164
Must have stored some up
over the years, eh?

276
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:35,166
All that trade with
cavalry, cattlemen?

277
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:39,153
Not much use for coin
out there in the flats,

278
00:24:39,154 --> 00:24:42,740
is there, Mr. roe?
It weighs a body down.

279
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:46,644
My son is dying
of grief.

280
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:48,630
His mind is gone.

281
00:24:48,631 --> 00:24:52,150
I will pay you
anything you ask.

282
00:24:52,151 --> 00:24:55,436
What more
can a father do?

283
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:01,159
A desperate man
should never lay

284
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,645
all his cards
on the table

285
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:05,530
when doing business,
Mr. roe.

286
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,154
Well...

287
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:16,341
Let's have a look at
what you've brought.

288
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:19,143
Then we can talk
more reasonably.

289
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,679
I'd be obliged, sir.

290
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:37,962
Flat out of tonic.

291
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:41,015
Oh, good! That's good.
That's the plan.

292
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:43,018
Means they'll come
back tomorrow.

293
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,136
Tell them there'll be plenty
for all tomorrow evening.

294
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:46,687
What's he come for?

295
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:48,956
Oh, just
a bit of business.

296
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:50,758
You carry on
with the customers now

297
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,627
before they all
dwindle away on us.

298
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:54,112
Where's awbonnie?

299
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:57,632
She's...Mr. Roe, do you
remember my son Reeves?

300
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,134
Yes, I do.

301
00:25:59,135 --> 00:26:02,170
How's my sister,
Mr. roe?

302
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:07,108
She's...Passed.

303
00:26:08,844 --> 00:26:11,012
'Twas an accident, Reeves.

304
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:14,148
She died in childbirth.
Couldn't be helped.

305
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:17,301
Now, you go attend to
the business at hand, eh?

306
00:26:17,302 --> 00:26:20,639
He's always carried
an unnatural fondness

307
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,940
for his half-sisters,
Mr. roe.

308
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:24,458
You can't blame him
for that.

309
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,810
No, I don't.

310
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,351
Leave him!

311
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:35,937
He's got a temper
like a red snake.

312
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:39,240
Best let it stew
till it passes through.

313
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:41,776
What have you
come back here for?

314
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:50,084
What, are we all
for sale now?!

315
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:57,292
I think it best,
under the circumstances,

316
00:26:57,293 --> 00:27:00,812
if we continue our business
another time, Mr. roe.

317
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:02,513
It can't wait.

318
00:27:02,514 --> 00:27:04,849
It will have to wait.

319
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:31,476
You stay still. Stay.

320
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:42,620
They watch.
They have their eyes.

321
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:47,492
They listen for you,
but I know them.

322
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:52,830
I am guarding.

323
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:57,601
They can't see me.

324
00:27:57,602 --> 00:28:00,555
They think
my mother took me.

325
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,006
They think that.

326
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,011
Please stay.

327
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:15,570
I will stay until...
Your hair...

328
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,339
Has blown away.

329
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,293
No bone will stay.

330
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:24,595
No last bone.

331
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,132
You're a dog...

332
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:04,635
A low dog,
to tie me here.

333
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:07,655
Awbonnie...

334
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:09,791
Is it you?

335
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:16,080
You must leave here.

336
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:20,168
Now! Leave...

337
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:22,353
This place.

338
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:24,189
They will tear your body.

339
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:28,142
Let them.

340
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,112
Let them
devour me...

341
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:35,149
So I can fly.

342
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,468
I'll die without you.

343
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,577
Ow!

344
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:54,702
You keep me bound here

345
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:57,204
out of your selfish
fear of aloneness.

346
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:00,074
I'm not your life!

347
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:01,459
Aah...

348
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:11,886
No!

349
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:14,255
No!

350
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:18,543
Noooo!

351
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,430
Noooo!

352
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:24,465
Noooo!

353
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:26,601
Noooo!

354
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:27,919
Uhh!

355
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:32,640
Ohh!

356
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:37,679
It's you that must
release me.

357
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,480
Throw this body
to the wind.

358
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:42,217
Let them feed her
to their young.

359
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:48,779
Unh!

360
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,978
Uhh! Uhh!

361
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:25,383
I'm sorry about this.
I truly am.

362
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:28,936
But there was no other way
to get it done.

363
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:30,722
I'll not harm you.

364
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:33,624
I swear on an oath
to that.

365
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:19,096
Mmm.

366
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:22,283
Mmm.

367
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:08,762
That's the one.

368
00:38:08,763 --> 00:38:10,114
Had her tongue
cut out

369
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:11,465
for lying to
her headman.

370
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:13,066
How can you tell
from this far off?

371
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:15,169
She's the only
bone picker out here.

372
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,620
It's got to be her.

373
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:20,508
Go on.
Try your Irish luck.

374
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,709
She won't
make a sound.

375
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,695
I'll guarantee that.

376
00:38:24,696 --> 00:38:26,113
Turn yourself around,
Reeves,

377
00:38:26,114 --> 00:38:28,616
or the banshees
will get you.

378
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:31,802
Do it now!

379
00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:33,937
If I catch you looking,

380
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:35,522
I'll thrash you
till your knees buckle.

381
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,658
Ha ha ha!

382
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:39,743
You might as well let him
see how it's done.

383
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:42,413
Quick, now.
She's got a jump on you!

384
00:38:57,779 --> 00:39:00,414
Uhh!

385
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:04,185
Look here, boy.

386
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:07,454
Now, this is what you got
coming up ahead, son.

387
00:39:13,795 --> 00:39:16,430
I made her
my legitimate wife!

388
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:18,632
I...Mmm...

389
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,622
You don't forget that!
Don't ever forget that!

390
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:28,058
Don't...Ever...
Forget that!

391
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:30,778
So you went and swapped
her after all,

392
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,429
just like awbonnie!

393
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,181
You'll go straight
to hell for that!

394
00:39:34,182 --> 00:39:35,883
You might as well
have killed them both

395
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:37,368
with your own hand!

396
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:40,370
Killing! Killing!
Now he's on about killing!

397
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:42,439
Get off! Get off!

398
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,260
Too early in the morning
for killing.

399
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,911
The sun's
barely cracked.

400
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:49,162
When did they leave?

401
00:39:49,163 --> 00:39:51,298
Who leave? Stop
talking in riddles.

402
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:53,267
Velada and roe!
They've gone!

403
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,301
Gone?

404
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:55,770
When did they
take off?

405
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,388
Gone?

406
00:39:57,389 --> 00:39:59,340
As though
you didn't know.

407
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:01,542
Gone?

408
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:03,260
Oh! What?

409
00:40:05,597 --> 00:40:07,614
And he's pilfered
the...Paint!

410
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:10,968
Oh, goddamn
his Irish hide.

411
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:13,955
Get my mule tacked out
and be quick.

412
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,639
That paint!

413
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,659
That paint
was worth $100.

414
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:21,088
Bend forward while
I unleash that nose bag.

415
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,973
Do as I say.

416
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:30,965
I don't expect you to think
too kindly towards me

417
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:32,249
for my actions,

418
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,153
but I'm asking you to listen
to me with your heart.

419
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:42,426
Do you remember me?

420
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:49,500
The selfsame man that
purchased your sister...

421
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:52,302
A year back, last spring?

422
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:55,539
Your brother
must have told you.

423
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,991
You must remember.

424
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:00,960
She was joined
in wedlock to my son.

425
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:05,399
I chose between you
at the time.

426
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:17,043
There's no way to foresee
the outcome of a thing.

427
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:22,148
What I'd hoped to be
my son's salvation...

428
00:42:22,149 --> 00:42:23,951
Became his ruin.

429
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:31,041
Your sister was his light.

430
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,977
He thrived
in her company.

431
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:38,048
Then she...

432
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:39,983
Your sister...

433
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:52,096
She has since...Died.

434
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:04,908
No!

435
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:23,087
If you could give...

436
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:27,090
Me a sign...

437
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:31,595
Some sign so...

438
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:36,216
I'd know...

439
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:40,120
How to...Find you.

440
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:56,220
Take me with you.

441
00:44:58,189 --> 00:45:00,124
Awbonnie...

442
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:04,144
Take me.

443
00:45:15,056 --> 00:45:18,541
¶ the devil he came
to the man at the plough ¶

444
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:21,545
¶ saying, "one of your family
I must take now" ¶

445
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:23,913
¶ he said, "my good man,
I've come for your wife" ¶

446
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:28,051
¶ "for I hear she's the plague
and torment of your life" ¶

447
00:45:28,052 --> 00:45:30,570
¶ so the devil,
he hoisted her up on his back ¶

448
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:33,640
¶ with a rightful, tightful
titty filet ¶

449
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:35,643
¶ the devil,
he hoisted her up on his back ¶

450
00:45:35,644 --> 00:45:40,046
¶ and he landed at
hell's hall door with a crack ¶

451
00:45:40,047 --> 00:45:41,714
oh, break it off,
will ya?

452
00:45:41,715 --> 00:45:43,634
Now's not the time
for braying.

453
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:45,085
Your daughter's
been absconded with,

454
00:45:45,086 --> 00:45:46,169
in case you forgot.

455
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,572
Eh...The daughter,
the daughter.

456
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:50,090
Eh, that's right.

457
00:45:50,091 --> 00:45:52,592
Had to be
some good reason

458
00:45:52,593 --> 00:45:56,996
we find ourselves adrift
in the lone prairie, eh?

459
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:01,901
¶ Two other devils
looked over the wall ¶

460
00:46:01,902 --> 00:46:06,089
¶ they said, "take her away
or she'll murder us all" ¶

461
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:09,610
¶ now, I've been a devil
the most of me life ¶

462
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:12,612
¶ I ne'er was in hell
till I met with your wife ¶

463
00:46:12,613 --> 00:46:16,583
¶ so, it's true that the women
are worse than the men ¶

464
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:19,119
¶ for they went down to hell
and were thrown out again ¶

465
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,670
ha ha ha!

466
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,155
You got a lot of salt

467
00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:23,574
calling yourself
a father at all.

468
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:26,209
It was forced upon me
by cruel nature.

469
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,845
I never had a say
in the business.

470
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:31,414
No, sir! A father is not
my calling in this life.

471
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:33,283
This is true.

472
00:46:33,284 --> 00:46:35,986
Wizard of the plains
is more to my liking.

473
00:46:35,987 --> 00:46:40,624
Ha ha ha!
Wizard of the plains, eh?

474
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,142
Should have
shot his hide

475
00:46:42,143 --> 00:46:44,511
the second
he rode into camp.

476
00:46:44,512 --> 00:46:48,932
Who? Roe? He seemed
a reasonable man to me.

477
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,150
Reasonable?!

478
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:52,652
How do you find yourself
siding with him

479
00:46:52,653 --> 00:46:54,187
and not
your own daughters?

480
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:58,609
He's an irishman and
a gentleman, too, I believe.

481
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,610
Horse thievery's
his main transgression.

482
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:03,614
And believe me, he'll pay
through the teeth for that.

483
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,766
That paint was worth
more than both daughters

484
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,986
and you thrown in,
to boot.

485
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:11,638
It shames me to be
the son of a pig.

486
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:12,956
You'll grow out of it.

487
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:15,292
Just thank your stars
you weren't born a half-breed,

488
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:17,944
like your demon sisters.
Hey! Ha ha!

489
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,982
¶ There was a young lady
from ulster ¶

490
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:25,585
¶ whose friends they thought
they had lost her ¶

491
00:47:25,586 --> 00:47:29,940
¶ till they found in the grass
the marks of her ass ¶

492
00:47:29,941 --> 00:47:32,592
¶ and the knees of the man
who had crossed her ¶

493
00:47:32,593 --> 00:47:34,611
hey hey hey!

494
00:47:34,612 --> 00:47:37,097
What time you say that
three o'clock train go out?

495
00:47:37,098 --> 00:47:39,148
Three o'clock train?
Well, that train go out

496
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:41,084
exactly 60 minutes
past two.

497
00:47:41,085 --> 00:47:42,602
Ha ha ha!
That's funny.

498
00:47:42,603 --> 00:47:44,220
Why is that funny?

499
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:45,655
Fellow at the depot
told me that train

500
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:47,440
goes out exactly
60 minutes before four.

501
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:49,860
Well, you won't miss
your train nohow.

502
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:54,164
That serum couldn't
cure a well man.

503
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:55,348
That's
enough business here.

504
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:57,518
We don't need none of
your carnival trash.

505
00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:59,036
Excuse me.

506
00:47:59,037 --> 00:48:02,038
Which is the other side
of the street?

507
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,907
The other side of
the street? Why--

508
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:07,928
get your sorry asses
on down the line!

509
00:48:07,929 --> 00:48:10,864
He said--unh--he said
it was over there.

510
00:48:10,865 --> 00:48:13,566
Well, you can't depend
on everything you hear.

511
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:16,286
Get up!

512
00:49:58,055 --> 00:50:00,657
We're heading east now,
aren't we?

513
00:50:03,061 --> 00:50:05,361
East? This is east?

514
00:50:05,362 --> 00:50:07,664
I'm sure
we're heading east.

515
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:13,320
It's your deal.

516
00:50:35,476 --> 00:50:39,129
Hey! Where to?

517
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:45,935
Land!

518
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:49,956
You can have it!

519
00:50:53,678 --> 00:50:58,682
Hey! We've lost
our leader!

520
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:00,133
Ha ha ha ha!

521
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:12,039
You turn your back
on me.

522
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:18,661
You think you can
refuse me?

523
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:24,134
I...Remember you.

524
00:52:26,954 --> 00:52:29,239
I was sold
like a slave.

525
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,593
I died giving birth
to your child,

526
00:52:33,594 --> 00:52:36,613
a child
I never wanted.

527
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:39,583
I hold onto you.

528
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:41,684
Do you think I would
love you for that?

529
00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:43,870
Take me with you.

530
00:52:43,871 --> 00:52:47,423
You have no right
to ask me that.

531
00:52:47,424 --> 00:52:49,426
You belong
in <i>this</i> world...

532
00:52:52,496 --> 00:52:53,946
Not mine.

533
00:52:55,483 --> 00:52:57,950
You owe me my freedom.

534
00:52:57,951 --> 00:52:59,736
How?

535
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:06,927
Let my body burn.

536
00:53:09,063 --> 00:53:12,883
Throw it in the fire.

537
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:15,952
It's you that must
release me.

538
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:22,908
Then you take your own life!

539
00:53:25,696 --> 00:53:28,965
Do it.
It's in your hands.

540
00:53:31,168 --> 00:53:36,039
Place that gun
in your mouth

541
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,991
and set me free.

542
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,662
I warn you now...

543
00:53:42,663 --> 00:53:46,016
If you don't do
this thing that I ask,

544
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:50,836
then a curse will fall
on your father's head.

545
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:06,519
Yes...

546
00:54:08,055 --> 00:54:09,506
Do it.

547
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:13,126
Your suffering is nothing

548
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:16,179
compared to what your
father will have to bear.

549
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,037
Do it.

550
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:29,825
Do it.

551
00:54:32,096 --> 00:54:33,512
Do it.

552
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:38,551
Do it!

553
00:56:46,413 --> 00:56:47,947
Uhh!

554
00:56:59,493 --> 00:57:02,762
I was wrong to steal you
against your will,

555
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:05,531
but you must help me.
I've no one else.

556
00:57:05,532 --> 00:57:08,184
You must help me now.

557
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:20,747
If your sister
hadn't come,

558
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:23,149
he would never
have made it.

559
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,752
Do you understand me?

560
00:57:25,753 --> 00:57:27,586
You must replace her.

561
00:57:27,587 --> 00:57:30,190
It's his only chance.

562
00:57:30,191 --> 00:57:33,642
I am not my sister.

563
00:57:33,643 --> 00:57:37,213
I can make you
the same offer

564
00:57:37,214 --> 00:57:39,114
I made
your father.

565
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:42,118
You'll be richer
than him by far.

566
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,420
Gold coin.
Three mounts.

567
00:57:46,323 --> 00:57:49,308
The very ones
you tried to steal.

568
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:52,412
Three horses...

569
00:57:52,413 --> 00:57:54,814
And gold.

570
00:58:01,004 --> 00:58:04,006
I am begging you now.

571
00:58:04,007 --> 00:58:06,642
You'll be free
of your father.

572
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:25,311
Four horses...And gold.

573
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:44,430
- Ahh!
- That's it, eh?

574
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:47,066
That's the last of it!

575
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,569
It's time
we turn back now.

576
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:53,123
It's dark thirty.

577
00:58:53,124 --> 00:58:55,958
They've gone into
a whirlwind here.

578
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:57,894
I can't make this out.

579
00:58:57,895 --> 00:59:00,730
It's time we turned back now.
The banshees will get us.

580
00:59:00,731 --> 00:59:02,181
We're not turning back!

581
00:59:02,182 --> 00:59:04,150
There's sign here.
Just gotta figure it out.

582
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:06,068
You're not going to
track a plainsman

583
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:07,937
out into flatland
he knows better

584
00:59:07,938 --> 00:59:09,956
than the inside
of his own mouth!

585
00:59:09,957 --> 00:59:11,957
We probably passed him
a dozen times already

586
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:14,060
and never even
known it.

587
00:59:14,061 --> 00:59:15,578
Now, mount up!

588
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:17,680
And point these leatherheads
for home camp.

589
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:19,832
We've wasted enough time
on this malarkey!

590
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:21,901
Are you telling me you just
want to leave her lost?

591
00:59:21,902 --> 00:59:23,419
Abandon her?!

592
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,888
I got a whole troupe back
there loaded with tonic.

593
00:59:25,889 --> 00:59:27,891
They're ready
to move out.

594
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:30,409
They'll pack out without me!
They'll steal me blind.

595
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,996
I'm not--not trading in
me livelihood

596
00:59:32,997 --> 00:59:35,064
just to pursue
a rat-tail horse thief!

597
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:37,082
What about Velada?

598
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,818
She'll make do.

599
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:40,319
She's a kiowa.

600
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,505
She's your daughter!

601
00:59:42,506 --> 00:59:45,791
She's a kiowa first!

602
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:55,768
You'll never make your way
back without me.

603
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:57,670
You've lost your sense
of the prairie,

604
00:59:57,671 --> 00:59:59,255
if you ever had one
to begin with!

605
00:59:59,256 --> 01:00:02,008
Wizard of the plains!

606
01:00:05,995 --> 01:00:07,947
Are you refusing me,
then...

607
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:10,966
Your own father?

608
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:13,036
You're no father to me.

609
01:00:15,522 --> 01:00:18,023
You'll mount
that miserable gelding now

610
01:00:18,024 --> 01:00:19,925
before I separate
your ears.

611
01:00:19,926 --> 01:00:22,695
You haven't
got the sand.

612
01:00:25,632 --> 01:00:27,049
Try...

613
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,620
Try if you will, son,

614
01:00:31,621 --> 01:00:33,890
to put yourself
in my boots.

615
01:00:35,108 --> 01:00:36,992
I've grown accustomed

616
01:00:36,993 --> 01:00:38,995
to an hourly lubrication
over the years,

617
01:00:38,996 --> 01:00:40,379
and I can't just sever
the connection.

618
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,730
It's not like that.
It's not like a woman.

619
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:44,750
I've got to get back
to me supply of tonic!

620
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:47,287
Well, think of
the troupe, then!

621
01:00:47,288 --> 01:00:48,538
Remember that time
in Wichita

622
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:49,889
when they almost lynched
the whole lot of us?

623
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:52,925
We can't just leave them
back there in limbo!

624
01:00:52,926 --> 01:00:56,879
Ah, there's no percentage
in this cruelty.

625
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,549
None whatsoever!

626
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:02,535
You got to think of
your poor father in this.

627
01:01:02,536 --> 01:01:04,053
It's me now.

628
01:01:04,054 --> 01:01:07,089
I mean, I'm the one
that's suffering, not her!

629
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:10,609
She's an Indian!
They were born to suffer!

630
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:14,163
Follow.

631
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,101
Heathen children...

632
01:01:19,102 --> 01:01:20,837
The lot!

633
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,536
My sister is sending you
her thoughts.

634
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:55,604
Your sister is dead.

635
01:01:55,605 --> 01:01:58,607
She is my mother's weapon.

636
01:01:58,608 --> 01:02:02,595
She is moving on you now
with vengeance.

637
01:02:02,596 --> 01:02:04,130
We've got
to get to my son.

638
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:06,248
We've got to get
to him fast.

639
01:02:06,249 --> 01:02:09,736
I cannot move
against my sister.

640
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:12,538
Your sister is dead!

641
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:14,073
She's gone!

642
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:18,477
She's more alive
than you.

643
01:02:27,637 --> 01:02:29,655
We've made our bargain.

644
01:02:44,254 --> 01:02:50,760
¶ If I was home,
I'd lay in my bed ¶

645
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:59,568
¶ prop up my feet
and pillow my head ¶

646
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:08,511
¶ gaze out the window
and look at the sky ¶

647
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:18,637
¶ and rest while the bluebirds
go whistling by ¶

648
01:03:18,638 --> 01:03:23,743
¶ go whistling by ¶

649
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:06,919
Angel...

650
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,439
She won't steal you.

651
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,808
She won't...

652
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:15,077
Take you from me.

653
01:04:15,078 --> 01:04:16,395
No.

654
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:23,101
Why, she brought--she brought
the demon with her.

655
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:25,337
No. No!

656
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,627
You must go on to him
by yourself.

657
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:51,096
Say nothing to him
about me.

658
01:04:55,502 --> 01:05:00,940
All he needs is a voice,
a kindness.

659
01:05:02,526 --> 01:05:06,478
I expect nothing from you
but to comfort my son.

660
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:12,234
All you must do
is to show him some...

661
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,803
Affection.

662
01:05:16,873 --> 01:05:18,424
Go now.

663
01:05:18,425 --> 01:05:20,409
Save him.

664
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:33,075
You can do what you want
with my father,

665
01:07:33,076 --> 01:07:35,127
but this body's mine!

666
01:07:35,128 --> 01:07:38,214
It belongs to me!
You'll never separate us!

667
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:40,065
I hold this body!

668
01:07:43,086 --> 01:07:46,021
I will send you to
your death a second time

669
01:07:46,022 --> 01:07:47,239
if you touch her!

670
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:07,877
He's afoot now.

671
01:08:07,878 --> 01:08:11,513
Look at this.
He's got to be afoot.

672
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:14,500
You've not got the mental gift
to track this man.

673
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:17,003
He's schemin' you.
Can't you tell by now?

674
01:08:17,004 --> 01:08:18,521
If he's afoot,
there's a reason for it.

675
01:08:18,522 --> 01:08:21,089
He is leading us
to our doom.

676
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:23,025
Velada's
escaped him. Look.

677
01:08:23,026 --> 01:08:25,277
Look for yourself.

678
01:08:25,278 --> 01:08:28,731
He's afoot.
I've got him now.

679
01:08:28,732 --> 01:08:31,884
You're an idiot.
He's got you!

680
01:08:31,885 --> 01:08:34,069
You're playing right
into his hand.

681
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:36,104
She slipped away
from him, I tell you.

682
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:39,258
Yaah!

683
01:08:43,547 --> 01:08:46,248
Insanity's a sorry thing.

684
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:48,817
Dear lord in heaven,
save me from it.

685
01:08:48,818 --> 01:08:52,104
A Professor deserves
a better fate than this.

686
01:08:52,105 --> 01:08:54,907
I'm a European,
not a savage.

687
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:20,399
Whatever in the world
you do now, son,

688
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,985
don't raise your eyes
to the horizon.

689
01:09:22,986 --> 01:09:26,054
Put your eyes back down,
you fool.

690
01:09:26,055 --> 01:09:27,572
Don't look at them.

691
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:29,508
Keep your horse moving
at the same pace.

692
01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:32,510
Don't change stride
an inch.

693
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:35,113
It's just
a hunting party.

694
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:36,982
Just a hunting party?

695
01:09:36,983 --> 01:09:41,603
And what do you suppose
they might be hunting?

696
01:09:41,604 --> 01:09:44,690
I'm telling you now,
if we don't turn back,

697
01:09:44,691 --> 01:09:47,977
their dogs will be eating
our testicles by nightfall.

698
01:09:47,978 --> 01:09:51,480
Now listen to reason,
this has gone far enough.

699
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:53,515
We're not
quitting this.

700
01:09:53,516 --> 01:09:56,618
Your stubbornness
is going to get us skinned.

701
01:09:56,619 --> 01:09:58,654
Is it stubborn
to reclaim what is ours?

702
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,038
She was stolen from us.

703
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:02,974
If it means our hides,
then let him have her.

704
01:10:02,975 --> 01:10:07,046
What is she to you except
a reminder of your sins?

705
01:10:08,365 --> 01:10:09,948
We're going to find her,

706
01:10:09,949 --> 01:10:12,951
even if we both die
doing it.

707
01:10:17,556 --> 01:10:19,208
They've gone.

708
01:10:25,548 --> 01:10:27,799
They'll be back,

709
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,552
and there won't be
just a handful next time.

710
01:10:30,553 --> 01:10:32,570
There will be so many

711
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:34,706
you'll think
the prairie sprouted them.

712
01:10:34,707 --> 01:10:37,042
I wasn't descended
from proud Irish chieftains

713
01:10:37,043 --> 01:10:40,012
in order to have me hide
stripped away by heathens.

714
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:21,670
Eat.

715
01:11:21,671 --> 01:11:24,506
You must eat.

716
01:11:28,294 --> 01:11:30,162
Take it.

717
01:11:30,163 --> 01:11:33,615
Yes! Eat, now.

718
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:40,172
Get your strength back.
That's it.

719
01:11:40,173 --> 01:11:42,124
That's it.

720
01:11:45,078 --> 01:11:51,015
Trust her.
Just let her help you.

721
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:52,985
Talbot.

722
01:11:55,221 --> 01:11:57,155
Talbot,
listen to me, now.

723
01:11:59,225 --> 01:12:03,212
You must forget about
this death.

724
01:12:03,213 --> 01:12:05,213
Let go of it.

725
01:12:05,214 --> 01:12:08,417
It's poisoned you enough.

726
01:12:08,418 --> 01:12:11,936
Look into her eyes.

727
01:12:17,294 --> 01:12:19,244
She will bring you back.

728
01:12:25,301 --> 01:12:26,317
Aah!

729
01:12:45,755 --> 01:12:48,907
Sister...

730
01:12:48,908 --> 01:12:53,495
You betray our mother.

731
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:58,850
You trade yourself
for horses and gold.

732
01:13:01,087 --> 01:13:06,074
You are lower
than the father who sold us.

733
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:18,387
You like bargaining
with whites?

734
01:13:18,388 --> 01:13:23,842
Well, then you bargain
with me--your sister.

735
01:13:25,328 --> 01:13:27,763
You move in close
to this squirming dog,

736
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:30,265
you pretend
that you love him,

737
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:32,183
you push your skin
next to him,

738
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:36,788
and then you take my body,
and you burn it!

739
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:39,424
You owe this to our mother!

740
01:13:44,664 --> 01:13:47,516
If you run...

741
01:13:47,517 --> 01:13:50,385
I will hunt you down...

742
01:13:50,386 --> 01:13:54,039
And cut your tongue out

743
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:58,494
so you will never ever,
never, never, never forget

744
01:13:58,495 --> 01:14:02,431
who gave you birth, do you?

745
01:14:18,248 --> 01:14:21,983
¶ "My darling maid,"
the youth then said ¶

746
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:24,970
¶ "the day
is drawing near" ¶

747
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:28,340
¶ "when Irishmen
will return again" ¶

748
01:14:28,341 --> 01:14:31,827
¶ "from all
their long career" ¶

749
01:14:31,828 --> 01:14:35,848
¶ "our holy land,
by God's command" ¶

750
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:39,834
¶ "the fairest land of all" ¶

751
01:14:39,835 --> 01:14:43,388
¶ "and heaven will see
old Ireland free" ¶

752
01:14:43,389 --> 01:14:48,026
¶ "bright star of Donegal" ¶

753
01:14:48,027 --> 01:14:51,213
I had envisioned
a better ending!

754
01:14:51,214 --> 01:14:53,615
One with far less pain!

755
01:14:53,616 --> 01:14:55,934
Not glory or riches, eh?

756
01:14:55,935 --> 01:14:58,169
Just painless and numb.

757
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:03,174
It was youthful lust,
out and out,

758
01:15:03,175 --> 01:15:05,377
full of all its raw
and mindless pleasure.

759
01:15:05,378 --> 01:15:08,730
Something you, no doubt,
have never experienced, eh?

760
01:15:08,731 --> 01:15:13,701
Such a faithful,
honorable brother as you.

761
01:15:13,702 --> 01:15:17,239
I could've let her wander
through the bones forever.

762
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,806
Never touched her at all!

763
01:15:18,807 --> 01:15:21,877
At least I made her
my legitimate wife,

764
01:15:21,878 --> 01:15:23,395
showed her some pity,

765
01:15:23,396 --> 01:15:26,181
which is more than
I can say for her now.

766
01:15:26,182 --> 01:15:29,384
She's paying me back.
Do you understand that?

767
01:15:29,385 --> 01:15:31,620
She's sending her dog soldiers
out to get me,

768
01:15:31,621 --> 01:15:33,405
I guarantee you that!

769
01:15:33,406 --> 01:15:35,541
Isn't that just
like a kiowa, huh?

770
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:37,675
They cut her tongue out,

771
01:15:37,676 --> 01:15:40,345
she rushes back to their fold
first chance she gets.

772
01:15:40,346 --> 01:15:42,647
I fed her and clothed her
all those years.

773
01:15:42,648 --> 01:15:45,651
She deserts me
back to her tormentors.

774
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:54,442
Shoot your mount and bury
yourself! They've come!

775
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:05,403
Dismount and shoot him now!
They'll be on us any second!

776
01:16:09,892 --> 01:16:12,577
They're not moving.

777
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,430
Dismount.

778
01:16:18,367 --> 01:16:19,818
Aah!

779
01:16:25,157 --> 01:16:29,161
Looks like you'll be
the one afoot now.

780
01:16:29,162 --> 01:16:31,529
I never wanted to
swap her, you know.

781
01:16:32,882 --> 01:16:36,517
It wasn't my idea.
It was roe's.

782
01:16:36,518 --> 01:16:40,722
Besides, we needed
horses at the time.

783
01:16:41,974 --> 01:16:44,842
At least
leave me a carbine!

784
01:16:44,843 --> 01:16:47,846
I'll be useless
against them without it!

785
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:51,199
It's not just me they want,
you know!

786
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,134
They'll come after you
in the night!

787
01:16:53,135 --> 01:16:54,919
And don't think they won't!

788
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,988
You're not absolved
from this,

789
01:16:56,989 --> 01:17:00,909
high and mighty
faithful brother!

790
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:04,263
They'll separate you forever
from your manhood!

791
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,307
You're not absolved.

792
01:18:43,946 --> 01:18:46,698
Who sent you here?
Who sent you?

793
01:18:48,116 --> 01:18:49,985
It was your father.

794
01:19:31,093 --> 01:19:34,679
Reeves!

795
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:39,167
Reeves!

796
01:19:39,168 --> 01:19:43,621
Reeves! You can't
abandon me to this!

797
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:46,474
We're flesh and blood,
Reeves!

798
01:19:46,475 --> 01:19:48,876
Europeans!

799
01:19:48,877 --> 01:19:52,964
Europeans!
Don't forget that!

800
01:19:52,965 --> 01:19:55,750
Kings and queens, eh?

801
01:19:55,751 --> 01:20:00,304
Knights of valor!
Masters of an empire!

802
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:03,124
Reeves!
Masters! Masters!

803
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:08,629
Not dogs! Not dogs!

804
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:12,517
We can't--we can't
succumb to this...

805
01:20:12,518 --> 01:20:14,001
This barbarism.

806
01:20:14,002 --> 01:20:16,004
We've got
to cling together...

807
01:20:16,005 --> 01:20:19,691
Cling together
at all costs!

808
01:20:19,692 --> 01:20:21,926
Reeves. Reeves.

809
01:20:23,512 --> 01:20:26,014
Reeves.

810
01:20:26,015 --> 01:20:28,032
Reeves.

811
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:30,534
Reeves!

812
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,003
Hey!

813
01:20:32,004 --> 01:20:35,106
Ha! Aah!

814
01:20:39,011 --> 01:20:41,462
Madness is
a sorry thing.

815
01:20:43,716 --> 01:20:47,152
Reeves! Reeves!

816
01:20:47,153 --> 01:20:50,955
Aah! Uh! Uh! Aah!

817
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:15,463
Good boy.

818
01:21:15,464 --> 01:21:18,066
Be still. Be still.

819
01:21:18,067 --> 01:21:20,735
Be still.

820
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,935
Nice and easy.

821
01:21:46,195 --> 01:21:50,465
Still in the market
for a wife, Mr. roe?

822
01:22:06,031 --> 01:22:10,418
No. Don't go.
Don't go now.

823
01:22:10,419 --> 01:22:12,554
You've come so far.

824
01:22:12,555 --> 01:22:13,955
It's you.

825
01:22:18,026 --> 01:22:20,628
It's you
who torments him.

826
01:22:22,047 --> 01:22:25,033
Why can't you
set him free?

827
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:27,552
He holds
no blame in this.

828
01:22:29,539 --> 01:22:32,540
It was me.

829
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:34,526
It was me...

830
01:22:34,527 --> 01:22:37,112
Who brought it
on his head.

831
01:22:37,113 --> 01:22:39,981
And it's you
who will pay.

832
01:22:53,562 --> 01:22:56,398
You'll never save your son.

833
01:22:56,399 --> 01:22:59,984
You know that, don't you?

834
01:22:59,985 --> 01:23:03,938
Mmm...You've always
known that.

835
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:07,525
Ha ha ha!

836
01:23:07,526 --> 01:23:10,545
He's far out of your reach.

837
01:23:10,546 --> 01:23:12,781
Far beyond you.

838
01:23:12,782 --> 01:23:16,618
He's in another world.

839
01:23:16,619 --> 01:23:19,087
You think my sister
can reach him?

840
01:23:19,088 --> 01:23:22,122
My sister?

841
01:23:22,123 --> 01:23:24,592
What is she to him?

842
01:23:24,593 --> 01:23:27,094
Another squaw.

843
01:23:27,095 --> 01:23:32,400
Another kiowa dog
sold for horses.

844
01:23:36,605 --> 01:23:42,042
What was the price
you paid, Mr. roe?

845
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,068
What was the price
you paid for me?

846
01:23:57,142 --> 01:23:59,560
Three horses, wasn't it?

847
01:24:06,134 --> 01:24:10,588
And you think my sister's
worth four, Mr. roe?

848
01:24:14,126 --> 01:24:18,145
Why is she worth four?
She's the same as me.

849
01:24:18,146 --> 01:24:21,149
She's just going
to die on you

850
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:22,600
just like I did.

851
01:24:31,042 --> 01:24:32,594
Uhh!

852
01:24:36,432 --> 01:24:38,483
Unh!

853
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:28,732
Unh!

854
01:25:33,872 --> 01:25:35,973
Ha ha ha!

855
01:25:35,974 --> 01:25:41,512
Your father has come
to save you.

856
01:25:41,513 --> 01:25:43,197
Ha ha ha!

857
01:25:45,634 --> 01:25:47,368
Sister!

858
01:25:48,854 --> 01:25:51,505
You think
you can replace me?

859
01:25:51,506 --> 01:25:55,526
You think you can
replace me in his heart?

860
01:25:55,527 --> 01:25:57,178
Ask him.

861
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:01,132
Ask him who holds
his heart.

862
01:26:01,133 --> 01:26:02,950
He will tell you.

863
01:26:07,122 --> 01:26:09,040
Tell her!

864
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:11,959
Tell her!

865
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:19,250
Tell her
how you can't live...

866
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:22,403
Without me.

867
01:26:22,404 --> 01:26:27,241
I am holding you.

868
01:26:27,242 --> 01:26:34,649
You can't
steal it from me.

869
01:26:36,652 --> 01:26:41,806
It...Is...Mine!

870
01:26:58,457 --> 01:27:01,543
No!

871
01:27:01,544 --> 01:27:06,330
Aah!

872
01:27:40,598 --> 01:27:42,050
Come.

873
01:27:47,122 --> 01:27:48,573
It's done now.

874
01:27:50,608 --> 01:27:52,627
It's finished.

875
01:27:52,628 --> 01:27:54,078
It's finished.

876
01:28:53,822 --> 01:28:55,439
Go ahead.

877
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:15,526
You'd say we were
safe now, wouldn't you?

878
01:29:15,527 --> 01:29:17,361
I mean, if you weren't
an Irish lunatic.

879
01:29:17,362 --> 01:29:20,464
Ha ha ha!
Which you're not.

880
01:29:22,501 --> 01:29:26,019
You'd say we're safe out of
Indian country, wouldn't you?

881
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:29,523
You had no business
taking us this far out.

882
01:29:29,524 --> 01:29:31,024
Whoa.

883
01:29:31,025 --> 01:29:34,028
Endangering our lives
for a short con,

884
01:29:34,029 --> 01:29:35,746
but this looks
good and safe to me.

885
01:29:35,747 --> 01:29:38,049
Wouldn't you say so?

886
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:39,650
I mean, if you were
white and halfway sane?

887
01:29:39,651 --> 01:29:40,818
Ha ha ha!

888
01:29:48,627 --> 01:29:53,330
¶ When I was a little boy,
or so me mammy told me ¶

889
01:29:53,331 --> 01:29:55,115
¶ way haul away ¶

890
01:29:55,116 --> 01:29:58,085
¶ we'll haul away, Joe ¶

891
01:29:58,086 --> 01:30:02,757
¶ if I didn't kiss the gals,
me lips would grow all moldy ¶

892
01:30:02,758 --> 01:30:05,092
¶ way haul away ¶

893
01:30:05,093 --> 01:30:07,328
¶ we'll haul away, Joe ¶

894
01:30:07,329 --> 01:30:09,647
¶ way haul way ¶

895
01:30:09,648 --> 01:30:12,450
¶ we'll haul
for better weather ¶

896
01:30:12,451 --> 01:30:14,852
¶ way haul away ¶

897
01:30:14,853 --> 01:30:17,504
¶ we'll haul away, Joe ¶

898
01:30:17,505 --> 01:30:22,610
¶ when I went away to sea,
I didn't know no better ¶

899
01:30:22,611 --> 01:30:24,862
¶ way haul away ¶

900
01:30:24,863 --> 01:30:27,532
¶ we'll haul away, Joe ¶

901
01:30:27,533 --> 01:30:30,985
fair people
of the raging wind,

902
01:30:30,986 --> 01:30:35,039
have you ever fallen
into a terrible fever?

903
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,007
Fever...

904
01:30:37,008 --> 01:30:39,977
Or known anyone who has?

905
01:30:45,033 --> 01:30:49,536
Not the fever
of the lovesick

906
01:30:49,537 --> 01:30:51,539
or the cowardly

907
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,023
or the forlorn,

908
01:30:53,024 --> 01:30:57,545
yearning for the hearth
of a new england home,

909
01:30:57,546 --> 01:31:02,983
but the real
burning fever!

910
01:31:09,474 --> 01:31:13,560
The fever
of the demon prairie

911
01:31:13,561 --> 01:31:16,163
and all its
attendant ills.

912
01:31:17,515 --> 01:31:19,050
Aah! Oh!

913
01:31:19,051 --> 01:31:22,119
Remarkable, isn't it,
how things come true?

914
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,055
I'd invented
this little fable, you see,

915
01:31:24,056 --> 01:31:26,073
the very one
I'm now living.

916
01:31:26,074 --> 01:31:28,408
I conjured it up
out of me own imagination.

917
01:31:28,409 --> 01:31:31,278
Oh, it was my sales pitch,
you see.

918
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:33,347
Yes. Infallible.

919
01:31:33,348 --> 01:31:36,116
Worked every time.
Yes. Worked every time.

920
01:31:36,117 --> 01:31:38,319
In fact,
it was my very livelihood.

921
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,104
Oh, yes! Aah!

922
01:31:40,105 --> 01:31:42,440
I...Ah...

923
01:31:42,441 --> 01:31:45,275
"Surrounded by
my primitive captors...

924
01:31:45,276 --> 01:31:49,029
"Painted faces...
A language unknown to me,

925
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:50,965
being a native son of Erin."

926
01:31:50,966 --> 01:31:53,551
Oh! Ha ha ha! Hey!

927
01:31:53,552 --> 01:31:56,554
I--I--I don't suppose
you know

928
01:31:56,555 --> 01:31:59,056
my former wife,
by any chance, eh?

929
01:31:59,057 --> 01:32:02,876
Ha ha! She ran off on me,
oh, several summers back.

930
01:32:02,877 --> 01:32:06,030
She...
She was unmistakable.

931
01:32:06,031 --> 01:32:07,981
Aah ha!

932
01:32:07,982 --> 01:32:12,553
Yeah! Yeah...
Oh, unmistakable.

933
01:32:12,554 --> 01:32:15,289
You'd know her by sight.

934
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,224
Yes, she...

935
01:32:17,225 --> 01:32:19,660
She had no tongue,
you see.

936
01:32:23,215 --> 01:32:25,066
No tongue to speak of.

937
01:32:25,067 --> 01:32:27,018
Aah!

938
01:32:27,019 --> 01:32:30,504
Anyway,
if you come across her,

939
01:32:30,505 --> 01:32:34,525
please...
Please impress upon her

940
01:32:34,526 --> 01:32:37,028
that I have now paid...

941
01:32:37,029 --> 01:32:39,530
More than paid
for her defilement.

942
01:32:39,531 --> 01:32:42,817
I'm now completely
absolved!

943
01:32:44,169 --> 01:32:48,022
Will you tell her that
for me?

944
01:32:48,023 --> 01:32:50,524
Aah! Aah!

945
01:32:50,525 --> 01:32:51,976
Aah!

946
01:33:50,485 --> 01:33:52,452
Nice little
place you got here.

947
01:33:52,453 --> 01:33:53,937
It's kind
of lonesome,

948
01:33:53,938 --> 01:33:55,890
but it's nice
just the same.

949
01:33:55,891 --> 01:33:58,909
Yeah, I got me
this place rent-free.

950
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:01,028
Government couldn't
<i>give</i> it away

951
01:34:01,029 --> 01:34:03,864
on account
that it's haunted.

952
01:34:03,865 --> 01:34:06,533
Oh, I ain't afraid
of no ghost.

953
01:34:06,534 --> 01:34:07,985
Well, that's good,

954
01:34:07,986 --> 01:34:09,820
because they're liable
to come wafting

955
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:13,057
in and out of here
any old time.

956
01:34:13,058 --> 01:34:14,541
You actually, uh...

957
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:16,043
I mean, you seen
them wafting?

958
01:34:16,044 --> 01:34:18,445
Yeah,
I seen them wafting,

959
01:34:18,446 --> 01:34:20,030
but you don't gotta
fret yourself none.

960
01:34:20,031 --> 01:34:22,048
Alls I do is sing them
my ghost song,

961
01:34:22,049 --> 01:34:25,035
and they scat
like a scalded dog.

962
01:34:25,036 --> 01:34:26,953
How does that
song go

963
01:34:26,954 --> 01:34:28,372
just in case
I need it?

964
01:34:28,373 --> 01:34:29,773
Goes like this here.

965
01:34:32,711 --> 01:34:35,746

966

972
