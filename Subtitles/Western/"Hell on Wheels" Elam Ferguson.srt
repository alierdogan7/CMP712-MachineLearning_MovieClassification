or the Wyoming territory again.

185
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,535
Or my family?

186
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:00,987
Will I ever see them again?

187
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,489
If you really wanted to, yeah.

188
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,991
I would really want to.

189
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,993
All right, then.

190
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,545
We'll take the train.

191
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,547
By then, I'll have my own private car.

192
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:12,549
Your car?

193
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,002
Will the baby and I be there?

194
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:18,838
That's what I meant.

195
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Cullen!

196
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,776
Elam.

197
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:43,196
God almighty, son.

198
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:45,031
Elam...

199
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,033
It's me... Cullen.

200
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,701
Can you see me all right?

201
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:51,254
I see you in my path.

202
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,426
Looks like something got at ya.

203
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,595
Bear?

204
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:01,381
I am bear killer.

205
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,216
Yeah.

206
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:07,220
Yeah, I own that's true
from the looks of it.

207
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:10,223
So these yours wives?

208
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:13,159
Huh?

209
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:15,612
Hey...

210
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:17,230
I got me a wife.

211
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:19,065
Can you imagine that?

212
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,233
A son too.

213
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,672
- Elam...
- What'd I tell you?

214
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,409
You want to buy these slave?

215
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:30,827
Please help us.

216
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:34,497
You don't speak unless you spoke to.

217
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,088
You want to buy 'em?

218
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,474
Elam...

219
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:46,843
I don't know what's messed you up,

220
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,646
but don't go riding into
Cheyenne like this.

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,848
I'm riding straight in.

222
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,484
Yeah, uh...

223
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,938
Yeah, we got a, uh, auction house.

224
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:01,858
Slave market?

225
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,110
Yeah. Why don't you
camp yourselves right here?

226
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:06,779
I'll come fetch you and the slaves

227
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,698
when the market opens.

228
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,334
That sound about right?

229
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:20,710
Mm-hmm.

230
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,348
All right.

231
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,622
This is a third-class ticket, sir.

232
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,594
[Scoffs]

233
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:14,397
[Laughter, indistinct chatter]

234
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,567
I got you on two pair.

235
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:21,954
And you, my friend, are bluffing.

236
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,074
[Chuckles]

237
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,909
I see your dollar.

238
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,578
Come on. This can't wait.

239
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,580
Leave the pot.

240
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,748
You're saving me from a busted flush,
but I'll lose my seat!

241
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,083
Elam's back.

242
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:38,155
Wait.

243
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,541
Something's happened to him.

244
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,326
I...

245
00:15:42,377 --> 00:15:45,495
Something bad. He ain't right.

246
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:49,249
Well, take me to him.

247
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,335
Now, you listen to me, Eva.

248
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,170
He's right messed up, especially his mind.

249
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,671
I don't care.

250
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:56,113
I seen something like it in the war.

251
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,724
Some wounds you don't want to survive.

252
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,226
What are you talking about? It's Elam!

253
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,728
I know! I...

254
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,181
What I'm saying is...

255
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,933
We got to be gentle, all right?

256
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:08,352
His... his... his remembering is wrong.

257
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:10,938
He don't seem to know me,
but he might know you.

258
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:14,191
- I can't believe he's back.
- He may not be back.

259
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:17,194
[Train whistle blows]

260
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,618
[Woman coughing]

261
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:38,142
Abby...

262
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,144
What are you doing here?

263
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:42,564
I'm going home to Boston.

264
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:45,200
This train doesn't go to Boston.

265
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,985
This is a private train.

266
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:48,653
We have to get you off.

267
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:51,256
Uncle Thomas, please.

268
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:58,496
I have to ask you something.

269
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:05,837
Why are people saying
you had something to do

270
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,389
with father's disappearance?

271
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:10,258
People don't think that.

272
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,394
They even say you killed him.

273
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,851
Yes.

274
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:23,855
I killed your father, Abby.

275
00:17:23,906 --> 00:17:26,658
Would you like to know how and why?

276
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:45,176
Elam?

277
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:57,272
Elam...

278
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:58,890
It's Eva.

279
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:01,776
It's me.

280
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,900
You been with them arapaho?

281
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,362
Who you belong to?

282
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,317
We used to belong to each other.

283
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:27,485
Can't no slave own no slave.

284
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:31,489
Go find your master, unless you a runaway.

285
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,325
Cut your heels for that.

286
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:35,744
Elam.

287
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,169
How come I want to hurt you?

288
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:47,172
For something I done to you.

289
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:52,561
I want you.

290
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:55,764
And I want to hurt you bad.

291
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,934
I don't blame you.

292
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,569
Now, who own you, I say?

293
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:02,237
- Nobody.
- You're a liar!

294
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,189
Whoa, Elam. It's all right. It's all right.

295
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:05,941
I'll come with you if
you let them women free!

296
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:07,742
- Eva, that can't happen.
- Elam!

297
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:10,412
Elam, listen to me. Listen to me.

298
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:12,747
Buying, trading, selling...

299
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:15,367
That can't happen, all right?

300
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,587
Times has changed. They won't let it.

301
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:20,372
I won't let it neither.

302
00:19:20,423 --> 00:19:21,840
It ain't up to you.

303
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:28,213
I don't even know you.

304
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,764
Get up! Get up!

305
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,052
Come on! Let's go! We going to market!

306
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,021
Come on!

307
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,711
On my advice,

308
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:48,706
he invested your estate's treasury

309
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,242
heavily in Union Pacific bonds.

310
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:54,879
When we had to default...

311
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:57,715
He became desperate.

312
00:19:57,749 --> 00:20:00,718
I take the blame.

313
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:03,721
He was prone to despondency,

314
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,890
as you know, Abby.

315
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:08,059
He came to me begging for help.

316
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:10,511
I couldn't.

317
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:14,649
Then one night he... he simply disappeared.

318
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:18,686
I can only imagine the worst.

319
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:20,354
He took his own life?

320
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,523
That's what you want me to believe?

321
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:24,408
He tried once before, you know.

322
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:26,911
Ask your mother, Abby.

323
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:29,530
But he lives on.

324
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,198
He sustains me

325
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,168
through my own nights of the black dog.

326
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,373
Are you lying to me, Uncle Thomas?

327
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,375
[Coughing]

328
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:43,127
No, Abby.

329
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:45,596
No.

330
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:48,633
Did I kill your father by including him

331
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,384
in my railroad dreams?

332
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:52,887
Will I regret that for the rest of my life?

333
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:55,389
Absolutely.

334
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:57,608
Am I a murderer?

335
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:01,946
Obviously not.

336
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,649
[Train squeals, rumbles]

337
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,784
[Steam hissing]

338
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:09,303
Is there trouble?

339
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:13,708
I'll go and check on it, and you stay here.

340
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,579
What I hear bid for these slaves?

341
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,414
Huh?

342
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,083
It's a good breed.

343
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:23,801
Can we handle the merchandise?

344
00:21:23,835 --> 00:21:25,252
[Laughter]

345
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:27,421
They breed good.

346
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:29,590
Why don't you take your
drunk ass and go home,

347
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:32,176
you black man? [Crowd gasps]

348
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,928
Somebody put a stop to this!

349
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,597
I need to hear a bid.

350
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:38,182
Somebody give me a bid!

351
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,433
Shit!

352
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:41,102
- Wait right here.
- Come on!

353
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:43,821
This a good breed right here.
They make good babies.

354
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:46,190
They work hard.

355
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:49,777
Sunup to sundown, they work hard.

356
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:53,280
Once you separate the
negro from his prisoners

357
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:56,834
and he refuses to surrender, kill him.

358
00:21:56,868 --> 00:21:58,252
What's your plan?

359
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:03,007
Separate the negro from the women.

360
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,459
If he should refuse,
then we'll have no choice, but...

361
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:06,961
Now, hold on. I don't think that's the way.

362
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:08,462
We don't even know what's going on.

363
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:09,797
Never hand me again.

364
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:16,020
There will be no trade in
human commerce in my town...

365
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:19,140
Neither involving squaw, white women,

366
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:20,858
nor addled negro.

367
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,309
All right, now, he ain't done nothing.

368
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:24,879
Contrarily, he's stated his intent

369
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,480
at the most heinous of crimes,

370
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:28,866
and he is guilty of
kidnapping at the least.

371
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,035
Look at him. He's a
danger to public safety.

372
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:34,238
[Shouting indistinctly]

373
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:37,074
Mr. Campbell...

374
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,493
You're a veteran.

375
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:44,048
You know what violence can do to a man.

376
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,500
Mainly to the weak-minded

377
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:49,503
and predisposed to violence.

378
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,256
The negro is an inferior race,

379
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:55,059
but human nonetheless.

380
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:59,513
That is why we fought your war,
Mr. Bohannon.

381
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:03,350
The emancipation proclamation,

382
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:05,269
the constitution...

383
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,354
Those are his rights.

384
00:23:07,356 --> 00:23:09,273
He ain't in his mind.

385
00:23:09,324 --> 00:23:11,525
He'll fight you if he's cornered.

386
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:14,528
Then that is his choice.

387
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,748
Field the perimeter when he makes a run.

388
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:22,888
That man right there...

389
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,878
That's my friend.

390
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,933
Okay.

391
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:39,553
You have 15 minutes to solve this charade.

392
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,072
Hey. What the hell is this?

393
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,907
Your stop.

394
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,077
This ain't no stop!

395
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:04,411
Hey, what are you doing?

396
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:06,664
Get your... get your hands off me!

397

[Grunts]

398
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,586
You're a dead man!

399
00:24:12,588 --> 00:24:15,089
Do you... you know who I am?

400
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:16,590
Do you know who I am?

401
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,675
I do.

402
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,593
[Grunts]

403
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:21,929
How did Mrs. Delaney get on the train?

404
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,930
We didn't see her, Mr. Durant.

405
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:26,150
[Whimpers]

406
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:29,436
Straight to Cheyenne after this.

407
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:32,072
[Both grunting]

408
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:10,278
Look at her. She breed good for you!

409
00:25:11,003 --> 00:25:13,890
- Gone crazy.
- She got everything you want.

410
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:18,662
She breed good and get you good business.

411
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:19,854
- What you gonna do?
- Get over here.

412
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:21,022
[Whimpers]

413
00:25:21,024 --> 00:25:22,823
Look at her.

414
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:26,196
I'm gonna retell him who he is.

415
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:28,055
- Elam?
- [Screams]

416
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:29,196
Get over there!

417
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:31,499
Elam!

418
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:36,916
Look hard at my face, all right?

419
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:40,202
Cullen Bohannon.

420
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,420
I hear of you.

421
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:43,789
[Softly] Yeah.

422
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,842
[Normal voice] We been friends a long time.

423
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,044
You got some slaves to sell?

424
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:52,214
That there one of yours?

425
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,885
This ain't a slave market.

426
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,755
This ain't Charleston, new Orleans neither.

427
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,258
This is Cheyenne.

428
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,394
You even know where you are?

429
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,232
[Crowd gasps]

430
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:15,123
You trying to fool me?

431
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,074
No.

432
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:22,912
I'm trying to save your damn life.

433
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:30,419
Come on.

434
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,588
Y'all get on home!

435
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,723
This ain't a damn show.

436
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,225
Elam: Prime, healthy.
It ain't gonna cost you a lot.

437
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,260
- Beat it, kid.
- Elam: Come here!

438
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,145
- Mr. Campbell.
- Elam: Look at her! This one...

439
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:41,931
Get!

440
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,402
You've left Mr. Bohannon to
defuse this situation alone?

441
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,487
Interesting to watch Mr. Bohannon

442
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:51,657
confront the monster of his own creation.

443
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,992
- Interesting?
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:55,277
Those women's lives are at risk.

445
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,946
I'm well aware.

446
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,782
I've ordered my men not to spook the negro.

447
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:05,504
His name is Elam Ferguson,
an honorable man.

448
00:27:05,506 --> 00:27:06,789
At least I've known him to be.
Elam: Come on!

449
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,458
Get your head up!

450
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,794
Act like you got some dignity!

451
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,429
You trying to be uppity on me?

452
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,964
You trying to be an uppity negro?

453
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,182
Nothing in his past will save him

454
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:20,636
from his fate today.

455
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,805
And killing a negro makes
you a little more formidable,

456
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,107
doesn't it?

457
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:28,043
Elam: They work hard.

458
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:31,146
Those women's lives are at risk.

459
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:34,316
We are in agreement on that, are we not?

460
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:38,320
Elam: I need to hear a
bid for these slaves now.

461
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:40,990
They're worth more than that.

462
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,326
Just keep in mind,
you'd be walking into five drawn guns.

463
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,461
Come on, now.

464
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,212
Do I hear a bid for these women?

465
00:27:47,214 --> 00:27:48,464
Get up. Look at me. Good lord.

466
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,666
Look at them. Show your face.

467
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,836
- What do you do? What do you do?
- Elam!

468
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:56,672
My brother.

469
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,841
[Both laughing]

470
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,729
Oh, I knew you'd know me.

471
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:06,181
Mm-hmm. Heard you was back, huh?

472
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:08,901
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

473
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:12,488
You about finished here?

474
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,273
I need... I need you to
get something for me.

475
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,607
Anything.

476
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,192
Run to the big house and tell mamma

477
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:18,694
to get me something for my head.

478
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,912
It's starting to hurt.

479
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:22,197
- Go ahead and run.
- Sure, Elam.

480
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,583
She most likely in the
kitchen right about now.

481
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,502
Now go on ahead.

482
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:27,536
Why don't you come with me, huh?

483
00:28:27,538 --> 00:28:29,171
Be faster.

484
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:31,206
No, shoot, man.

485
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,374
You know what'd happen
if the missus catch me

486
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:33,676
round the big house.

487
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,210
Now go on.

488
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:36,879
Come on, I got business.

489
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,213
Elam.

490
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,849
God, please listen to me.

491
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:43,052
The men here gonna kill you
you try to sell these women.

492
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,554
I know.

493
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:47,973
They gonna try.

494
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:50,359
Something they don't know...

495
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:53,195
Can't nobody kill me, mo.

496
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:54,730
Nobody.

497
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,066
What's my name?

498
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:01,036
Moses Then.

499
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:02,121
Go on ahead, man.

500
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:04,540
Go. Come on.

501
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:19,171

Just let me talk to him
one more time, please!

505
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,764
I know it's me he wants underneath.

506
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:29,932
I know it. Just let me talk to him!

507
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,400
Eva, he's liable to kill you.

508
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,902
I don't care. I'll take my chances.

509
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,437
Laws exist to protect us,

510
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,940
not only from others, but from ourselves.

511
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,659
Gentlemen. Man on the roof with a rifle.

512
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:42,494
Ms. Ellison, do something!

513
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:44,446
- There's nothing I can do, Eva.
- Time's up, Bohannon.

514
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:45,447
You're talking to the Governor.

515
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,332
Please say something to him.

516
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:48,700
I'm just a newspaper lady.
I don't have the authority...

These women's lives are at risk, Eva.

You think it best he be killed, don't you?

520
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,627
Don't you?

521
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:00,512
Now, you need to listen to me right now.

522
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:01,597
Hey!

523
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,966
You got to let these women go.

we had some times.

535

Put down some bad men.

We found your lost baby. You remember that?

537

Friends always.

539
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:01,857
You owned slaves.

[Whispers] Yeah.

Long time ago.

542
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:08,530
You was a slave yourself,
but you're free now.
