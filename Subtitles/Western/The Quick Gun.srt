1
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,169
'I know this land.

2
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:26,160
'It's rich land.

3
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:29,435
'Plenty of good water
and fields knee-deep in grass.

4
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:33,679
'A place where a steer can get
its belly full

5
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:36,763
'and a man doesn't have
to worry about tomorrow.

6
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,764
'I'm coming home.

7
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:42,331
'Another 35 miles, 40 maybe,

8
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:47,625
'I'll see the town of Shelby,
blistering out there in the hot sun.

9
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:51,474
'Just the way it was when I had
to leave it two years ago.

10
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,553
'Just two years.

11
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,933
'It feels like 20.

12
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,816
'I remember
what I had to leave behind

13
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:03,710
'and sometimes it feels like 100

14
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:07,116
'and I remember the men
I've had to kill.'

15
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,702
Hold it, bud.

16
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,486
You know there ain't nothing better
than a dead gunslinger.
- Cagle?

17
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,451
You hear that, Donovan?

18
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:25,109
Clint knows who it is
without even looking.

19
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,100
You come and stand guard this way,

20
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:31,192
old Spangler must be
somewhere around.

21
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:34,211
Big as life.
What's he doing in Montana?

22
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:37,236
Now, it could be
he'd like to ask you that question.

23
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,816
Hey!

24
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:03,235
Hey, Spang. Well, by gravy,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

25
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,594
If it ain't the devil himself.
Clint Cooper.

26
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:12,031
Ha-ha-ha. Hiya, Clint boy.

27
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,389
Good to see you, Spang.

28
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,245
I caught him coming up
on the high trail,

29
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:19,176
so I thought I'd better bring him in.
You thought right, Cagle.

30
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,720
You wouldn't want an old friend
to go riding by

31
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:24,110
without giving him an invite,
would you?

32
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:25,734
Come on, boy.

33
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,956
Yes, say talk of the devil.

34
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:31,647
I was saying to the boys
just yesterday,

35
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:35,111
I bet you my old friend Clint Cooper
would give plenty

36
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,749
to be with us right now.

37
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,271
Coffee, boy.

38
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,132
You're a long way from Missouri,
aren't you?

39
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:48,023
Longer than a horse's tail,
that's for sure.

40
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,970
Here, have some meat. No, thanks.

41
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:55,984
You still wearing them
tied down. Sit.

42
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:03,412
They make me a living. A living?
Oh, boy, don't you never learn?

43
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:07,580
I'm alive, I eat.

44
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:11,389
One of these days,
that gun of yours will be so fast

45
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:15,189
that you'll lose your appetite
real sudden.

46
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,601
We used to be a good team, Spang.

47
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,717
Yeah, best hired guns
in the business. Ha-ha.

48
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:24,158
Ah, but a fella's got
to look to the future.

49
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:27,518
Now you take me,
I've got 15 men working for me.

50
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:33,770
Any time we need money, vittles,
liquor, women, we just go get them.

51
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,779
And a there ain't a sheriff
west of Mississippi can stop us.

52
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:39,500
Ha-ha-ha.

53
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,407
How about it, boy?

54
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:44,184
You want to join up
with your old friend?

55
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:48,295
Something important get you
to Montana?

56
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:54,155
Maybe something important
brought us both to Montana.

57
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,435
My reason's personal.

58
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,545
Dang, if you ain't the closest mouth
I ever chinned with.

59
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:09,312
Just how personal do you think a
bank full of gold and greenbacks is?

60
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,113
It must be busting at the seams
to bring you all this way.

61
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:15,475
Juicy as a fat cat.

62
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:19,129
Them cattle bars come in
and just loaded her with cash

63
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,660
from buying herds
after the cattle drive. Ha.

64
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:26,516
And if you hadn't heard that money
was here ready to be took,

65
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,158
you wouldn't be here,
would you, Clint?

66
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,737
I told you, I have other reasons.

67
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:33,807
Sure, you told me, boy.

68
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:38,340
Only I wouldn't want the two of us
trying for that same bank.

69
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:41,860
You could guarantee it
by riding with me.

70
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:45,345
What I have to do,
I can't use any help.

71
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:49,107
Even if the money's in Shelby?

72
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:50,866
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

73
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:56,087
And it ain't only the money, we're
taking the whole town, all of it.

74
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:59,709
There ain't enough men
in Shelby to stop us.

75
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:05,036
Just think of it, boy, we could burn
that place to the ground

76
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,560
if we wanted to.

77
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:08,906
You'd ought to like that,

78
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:12,524
considering how you
and that town feel about each other.

79
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:18,232
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Make 'em sorry they
ever heard of Clint Cooper, eh, boy?

80
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:22,043
When I go to Shelby,
I'm going alone.

81
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,516
You think you're going to get
that money without me,

82
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,985
well, you're wrong, boy.

83
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:35,882
I don't like to kill friends,
Clint, but...

84
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,135
Makes us even, Spang.

85
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,095
I'm kind of against dying.

86
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:43,953
No, that's much more reasonable.

87
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,075
Never heard a man
not to change his mind.

88
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:48,596
Nope.

89
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,939
Never.

90
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:54,071
Ah!

91
00:06:57,724 --> 00:06:59,289
SPANGLER SPLUTTERS

92
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,288
I'll catch up with you, boy.

93
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,658
You'll have to stay alive to do it,
so tell 'em that.

94
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,715
Let him get to his horse, boys.

95
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:17,097
SPANGLER COUGHS

96
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,107
Hey.

97
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:24,513
HE SPLUTTERS

98
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:38,307
Grab hold of this rope, Spang.

99
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,722
Now walk me to the door.

100
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:53,451
Thanks, Spang.

101
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:04,850
Get that double-crossing gunner.
Get him before he gets to Shelby.

102
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,851
Ya! Ya!

103
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,138
GUNSHOT

104
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,832
GUNSHOT

105
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:58,519
'There it is,
the town I was born in.

106
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:03,052
'And I'm going to find out if it
still wishes I'd never been born.'

107
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,275
See you on Sunday, Mrs McCredie.

108
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:44,698
Rick, what's that murderer
doing back here?

109
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:45,824
He won't be here long.

110
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,072
Scotty.

111
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:21,611
You'd better get out there.

112
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:23,817
Clint Cooper's back.

113
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,372
And Rick Morrison saw him.

114
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:55,045
Scotty. Clint.

115
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,230
Let's have it.

116
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,507
Can't argue with the law.

117
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,539
GENERAL CHATTER

118
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:13,770
Inside.

119
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:30,116
If you wanted to commit suicide,
you could've found a lot easier way.

120
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:34,251
You're one of the few people around
who ever cared whether I did or not.

121
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:38,794
Clint, there hasn't been a shooting
in Shelby since you left.

122
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,951
Who gets the medal? You or the town?

123
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,715
All right, I know how you feel.

124
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,840
But when you rode out of here
two years ago,

125
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,898
they thought your guns
were gone for good.

126
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:52,134
When I rode back here today,

127
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:53,646
I could've used that

128
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,260
on Rick Morrison,

129
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:56,790
but I didn't.

130
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:59,200
Now that should tell you
where I stand.

131
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,535
I'm not the one
you have to convince.

132
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:04,466
Do you think for one minute
that Tom Morrison's forgotten

133
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,884
that you killed his two sons?

134
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,878
It was them or me,
you know it and this town knows it.

135
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:11,837
And they know this. Your guns got
too fast and too sudden.

136
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,414
And from what I hear
about your reputation,

137
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,365
they've got a lot faster and a lot
suddener in the last two years.

138
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,670
Scotty, sounds to me

139
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:25,183
like you're letting some
of this town's hate rub off on you.

140
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:26,650
I've got a job to do.

141
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,055
Friendship or not,

142
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:33,518
I can't let a gunslinger stay here.

143
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:35,905
You might just have
to put up with it.

144
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,998
My father's dead now, Scotty.
I aim to claim the ranch.

145
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:43,618
And start another battle
with the Morrisons?

146
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,457
No deal, Clint.

147
00:15:46,493 --> 00:15:48,815
Now water your horse and get out.

148
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:51,098
I don't want any trouble here.

149
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:53,482
You're going to get it,
whether you want it or not.

150
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:57,993
Jud Spangler will be raiding Shelby
before the day's over.

151
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,225
Spangler?

152
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,515
He knows most of the men are away
on a cattle drive

153
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:08,100
and the bank's full
of cattle buying money.

154
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,337
You seem to have an awful lot
of information.

155
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,135
He wanted me with him.

156
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:18,757
Soon as he finds the two dead men
I left at Big Rock Canyon,

157
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:19,943
he'll be coming.

158
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:25,890
Big Rock.

159
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:29,370
If they ride their horses
into the ground,

160
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,256
they could be here by sundown.

161
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,726
Most likely night,

162
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:37,096
depends on how long it takes them
to find the two deadmans.

163
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,140
There's something
I don't understand.

164
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:41,147
Knowing how you feel
about this town,

165
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,017
you still came here to warn us.

166
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:46,090
Finding out how the town
still feels about me,

167
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:48,436
I should've saved myself the ride.

168
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,830
BELL RINGS

169
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:54,602
School's letting out.

170
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,548
I have those kids to worry about.

171
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:03,742
I could use every gun hand
I could get.

172
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,356
You asking me to stay, now, Scotty?

173
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:11,357
I didn't hear you making any offer.

174
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:14,060
That's right, I didn't.

175
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:16,539
If I do say,
it'll be for my own reasons.

176
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,722
You mean Helen?

177
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,012
She's over at the schoolhouse.

178
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:24,123
Thanks.

179
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,574
Clint, don't mention Spangler.

180
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,456
I, er,
I don't want a panic in this town.

181
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:33,407
EXCITED CHATTER

182
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:36,529
CHATTER STOPS

183
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:57,751
You took a long time, Sheriff. When
are you getting Cooper out of here?

184
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:02,157
When I have to answer to you,
I'll turn in my badge.

185
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:03,769
Sheriff, we'd like to know.

186
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:07,280
You'll know when I'm ready,
this doesn't concern any of you.

187
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,484
Now go on about your business.

188
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:17,700
Keely.

189
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:20,773
As soon as I get the other council
men, we're going to have a meeting.

190
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,992
About what? Be here.

191
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:47,774
You've been a very naughty girl.
I'm sorry.

192
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:51,184
Nonetheless, I'm going to have
to punish you.

193
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,124
I want you to take this home
and write it 50 times.

194
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:59,096
50 times! 50 times. And bring it
back to me in the morning.

195
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,860
Yes, Miss Reed. Very well.

196
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:06,777
Clint!

197
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:11,415
You look fine, Helen.

198
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,367
Nobody ever thought
we'd ever see you again.

199
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:19,444
L- l-It's like seeing a ghost.

200
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:23,737
Came close to being one
several times.

201
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:27,461
Come on, don't you want
to be the first one to say

202
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:29,507
you're glad I'm back?

203
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,517
I AM glad, Clint.

204
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:40,509
It makes it worth some of the
thinking I've been doing about you,

205
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,258
the past two years. Yeah.

206
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:48,230
What did you think, Clint?
That I might change my mind about us?

207
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,776
Kind of a hope I had with me.

208
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:53,763
What kind of a hope could I have?

209
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:58,836
You're still wearing that gun,
you haven't stopped killing.

210
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:01,632
I've had time
to think about that, too.

211
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,692
I think I could leave the law
in Scotty's hands now.

212
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,872
Helen, the past can be forgotten.

213
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:16,820
There's still a lot of future
for us, if we want it.

214
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:20,693
You have no right
to expect anything of me, Clint.

215
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,407
What did you think? That this
schoolhouse could be my whole life?

216
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:27,295
When you left,
you left me nothing to love.

217
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,682
I needed something.

218
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:32,032
Now it's too late.

219
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,062
No, it isn't too late.

220
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,973
Now, you listen to me.

221
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,988
My father's ranch sits on good land,

222
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,264
we can turn that into one of the
best cow outfits in this country.

223
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,681
Something we'd be proud of,

224
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:50,801
something we'd be proud
to hand on to our children.

225
00:20:50,838 --> 00:20:54,232
Why didn't you think of that
two years ago?

226
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:57,070
Now, listen to me
and let this end it.

227
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,854
One week from Sunday,
Scotty and I are being married.

228
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,710
It's kind of funny.

229
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:16,429
I always kind of thought

230
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:19,930
the difference between Scotty's job
and mine was a badge.

231
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,659
I guess I was wrong.

232
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:34,168
If it had to happen...

233
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:38,510
...I'm glad it's Scotty.

234
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,134
He deserves someone like you.

235
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,483
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

236
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,354
BOYS LAUGH

237
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:34,048
Are you trying to ride
the flesh off that horse,

238
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:35,801
or did you forget he belongs to me?

239
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:37,518
If I ever forgot,
you'd remind me.

240
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:38,548
That's right.

241
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,932
I'll also remind you
that you're only living

242
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,899
by the grace of God
and Tom Morrison.

243
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:45,241
Anything to say to that?

244
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,935
Yes, I'm glad I'm only your nephew,

245
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:50,086
and not one of your sons.

246
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:56,774
You talk about my boys
like that again

247
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,881
and I'll run you
right off this ranch.

248
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:01,976
You'll get nothing from me,
do you hear? Nothing.

249
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:05,032
You've been taking out on me
since Clint Cooper left.

250
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,187
You can stop now he's back.

251
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:11,592
Where?

252
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:13,444
In town, just rode in.

253
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,594
Get our guns.

254
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,979
You going for him now,
in broad daylight?

255
00:23:26,103 --> 00:23:29,329
Two years I've waited, two years.

256
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:34,165
Get our guns.

257
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:16,114
I promise you, there will be
a grave for Clint Cooper, too.

258
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,559
There's two of us.
You make him draw first,

259
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:30,966
do you understand that?

260
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:36,493
I want him dead, legal.
Like an execution.

261
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:51,651
Mrs Swanson.

262
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,707
Been a long time, Mike.

263
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:02,674
Clint, please,
I got to ask you to leave.

264
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,584
It wouldn't be good business for me.

265
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,646
Whisky.

266
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:17,697
Leave it.

267
00:26:44,173 --> 00:26:45,914
Welcome back, Cooper.

268
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,655
Mr Morrison, please.

269
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:52,108
You think your gun's fast enough
for the two of us?

270
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:06,913
I have had to answer that
question many times.

271
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:09,173
This will be the last time.

272
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,267
Is that what you thought when you
sent your sons gunning for me?

273
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,378
You stood in my way.

274
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:18,000
You tried to steal our land,
Morrison.

275
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:19,931
Why are we talking so much?

276
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,825
You gonna draw, Cooper?

277
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:26,765
Awfully anxious to have me
draw first.

278
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:30,918
That's so Mike can tell the sheriff
we killed you legal.

279
00:27:30,954 --> 00:27:33,164
Are you ready to take your chances?

280
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,151
I didn't come looking for you.

281
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,027
Now leave me alone.

282
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:50,029
Cooper, you're yellow.

283
00:27:57,062 --> 00:27:58,925
Now draw.

284
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:02,646
Sorry.

285
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,794
Can't oblige you.

286
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:08,027
Not today, anyway.

287
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,371
Are you weaselling
out of it, Cooper?

288
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:30,949
That's the only kind of trouble
I can afford, Morrison.

289
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:09,937
That's enough!

290
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:18,978
If you started this...

291
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:21,918
No, no, Scotty,
I've got to be honest.

292
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:25,276
The kid was just having a peaceful
drink when they started all this.

293
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:27,581
And I'm not finished.

294
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,215
Damn fool. We got other trouble.

295
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,982
That's your trouble.

296
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:33,649
Cooper's mine.

297
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:36,771
Keely and Mitch are over
at my office right now
for a meeting I called.

298
00:30:36,807 --> 00:30:39,110
Are you going to be there or not?

299
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:54,959
I'm going to that meeting right now,

300
00:30:54,995 --> 00:30:56,528
Am I gonna tell that council

301
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,860
you're staying on
and helping us, or not?

302
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:01,155
You think of any reason
why I should?

303
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:04,831
No, I can't.

304
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:08,052
Then that's what you tell them.

305
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,749
All right, good luck.

306
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:16,657
Get started without me.

307
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:23,504
You're a mess, Clint.

308
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:30,928
I got to admit the Morrisons
didn't look much better.

309
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:36,257
I was going to drop by
to see you, Dan, but...

310
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,663
...I guess I just needed
a drink first.

311
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,838
I know, Clint. Scotty told me
that you saw Helen.

312
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:52,932
I got some cold water
and liniment at the hotel,

313
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:57,475
or don't you even want to
stay long enough to make repairs?

314
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,580
Take a look.

315
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:32,775
He's dead.

316
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:36,287
Rock-headed idiot got himself killed.

317
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:37,802
That looks like Dex.

318
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,441
Well?

319
00:33:11,477 --> 00:33:15,641
It looks like they both was in no
condition to come back and warn us.

320
00:33:15,678 --> 00:33:18,135
That gun-slinging snake.

321
00:33:18,172 --> 00:33:22,336
Spang, he's got a big headstart
on that money.

322
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:26,499
That he has. That he has.

323
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:31,435
Now, in that case,
we're just going to have to figure

324
00:33:31,472 --> 00:33:35,982
if the law don't catch him, we will.

325
00:33:47,307 --> 00:33:49,169
Come on around here.

326
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,095
I reckon this liniment won't
do much good

327
00:34:00,132 --> 00:34:02,572
for the kind of hurt
you think you have.

328
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:07,510
There's nothing holding me here.

329
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,738
When you left Shelby,
you spit on the town.

330
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:12,641
All of us didn't spit back.

331
00:34:12,677 --> 00:34:16,497
In my business you can't have
any friends, I found that out today.

332
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,115
So you'd rather just ride out of here

333
00:34:18,152 --> 00:34:21,094
and keep on using those guns for
something that can't ever matter?

334
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,706
I didn't want it that way, Dan.

335
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:32,868
See you.

336
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:38,451
Clint.

337
00:34:41,374 --> 00:34:43,779
Is that what you'll be
saying tomorrow

338
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,290
when you're wondering what
Spangler did to this town?

339
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,808
Spangler will want more than money,
I can tell you that.

340
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:10,261
I'm sure you all remember what
he did to Big Ben,

341
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:11,985
Iron Bill and Frank.

342
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,748
When he wanted women, he took them.

343
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:17,058
After his men got liquored up
they burned the towns to the ground.

344
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:20,628
And that is what
he has in mind for Shelby.

345
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,298
What can we do?

346
00:35:22,334 --> 00:35:26,297
We'll never be able to get
our ranch hands back from the drive.
They're too far away.

347
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,117
Why are we taking Cooper's
word for it?

348
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:30,799
He and Spangler rode together,
this could be a trick.

349
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:32,794
Are you out of your head? Am I?

350
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,718
You got some kind of guarantee

351
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:37,055
Cooper won't be a paid killer
behind our backs,

352
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:38,919
while Spangler hits us
from the front?

353
00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:41,704
I said I'd stay here
and help fight Spangler.

354
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,215
If I wanted to kill you, Morrison,
you'd be dead already.

355
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:47,335
Back off, Morrison.

356
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:49,921
We're wasting a lot of time
we haven't got.

357
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:53,088
Spangler might be 20 miles
from this town right now.

358
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,384
How do we vote? Mitchell?

359
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:57,596
Well, Scotty, you're the law.

360
00:35:57,632 --> 00:36:01,986
If you think we should stay,
it's your decision.

361
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:04,578
We need help, that's all I know.

362
00:36:04,615 --> 00:36:06,595
You know how I vote.

363
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,941
There's four against you, Morrison.

364
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:12,406
You know Spangler best,
you got any ideas?

365
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:17,279
The town is fairly well protected
from both sides by the hills.

366
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:20,182
Why don't we build a barricade
on each end of the street.

367
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,742
Keely, you spread the word without
getting the women hysterical.

368
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,891
Mitchell,
tell the Reverend to put the women

369
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:27,419
and children up in the church.

370
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:30,693
Make sure there's water,
food and plenty of blankets.

371
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,194
Morrison, you got extra guns
at your place, bring them in.

372
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:38,693
All right, Sheriff,
it's your party.

373
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,048
But I'm going to tell you
something.

374
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:43,540
I'll remember not to turn my back
on Cooper.

375
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,115
What do I do?

376
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:48,960
Get all the extra men
and drag out everything you
can use for the barricades.

377
00:36:48,996 --> 00:36:50,390
Scotty, what about the money?

378
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:52,195
Are you going to leave
it in the bank?

379
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,373
Why?

380
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:56,435
Seems to me that would be the first
place Spangler would look.

381
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:58,409
You are right,
I'll see that it is moved.

382
00:36:58,446 --> 00:37:02,408
Good, if he breaks through, it might
give us the extra time we need.

383
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:19,080
'The town knows what it has
to face now.

384
00:37:19,117 --> 00:37:20,878
'And it's doing its job.

385
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:22,602
'The men are tensing up.

386
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,585
'I can see how scared the women are.

387
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,974
'I wish I could tell them
we're a lot smarter than Spangler,
but I can't.

388
00:37:30,011 --> 00:37:35,450
'In the end, that's going
to make the big difference.'

389
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,041
Get those bales off that wagon.

390
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,830
Food and water's in the church,
Helen's getting the blankets now.

391
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,992
May as well will bring out
that kerosene.

392
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:50,363
Setting fire to a barricade
like that is liable
to blow up the whole town.

393
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:51,980
If we don't, Spangler will.

394
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,024
Go inside and take a seat.

395
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,032
Everybody stay calm.

396
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:08,260
Reverend, how come we're having
church on a Thursday?

397
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:14,907
If it was up to me, young fellow,
we'd have it every day.

398
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:18,622
Reverend, if my husband
and the other men knew
what was happening here,

399
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,485
I'm sure they
could get back in time.

400
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:23,203
The sheriff is the best judge
of how much time we have.

401
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,344
I bet there is going to be

402
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,623
a lot of shooting
around here, huh, Reverend?

403
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:30,348
Get moving, the Reverend is busy.

404
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:43,013
There's more blankets
if you need them.

405
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:45,454
May as well go ahead and douse it.

406
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:03,499
Clint, I don't know who else
has thanked you for helping,

407
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:06,966
but I'd like to.

408
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:12,412
As long as I was coming back
anyway...

409
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:15,421
Sorry I couldn't have brought
better news.

410
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:43,138
Right there.

411
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:45,533
There you are, Helen.

412
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:48,422
Are we going to sleep on those?

413
00:39:49,977 --> 00:39:51,995
I don't see why not.

414
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:55,258
During the Sunday sermons,
Pa sleeps without a bed.

415
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:59,216
You go back
and stay with your mother.

416
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,185
Where can I set all this up?

417
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:18,385
Well, let's see. I guess maybe
this would be the safest place.

418
00:40:18,422 --> 00:40:20,017
Mitchell?

419
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,568
Yes, Scotty.

420
00:40:21,605 --> 00:40:24,048
Help me put this table up here,
will you?

421
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:30,559
Some other things
I want to bring in.

422
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,708
Is everything getting organised?

423
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,031
Best we can.

424
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:52,407
Helen, there's something
I think you ought to know.

425
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,997
This note was left on my desk.

426
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,521
Clint left it there.

427
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:02,194
Clint?

428
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,468
It says that if we get
out of this mess,

429
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:10,155
that he wants us to take his ranch
as a wedding present.

430
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:13,858
Oh, Scotty, no.

431
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:20,322
How do you refuse a fellow that
gives you the only thing he owns?

432
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:24,868
Then he's planning to leave Shelby?

433
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:28,287
You don't want him to, do you?

434
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:33,081
Do you?

435
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,864
Scotty, I said I would marry you.

436
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,412
That hasn't changed.

437
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:42,506
Hasn't it?

438
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:49,062
Sooner or later,
I guess we had to find out.

439
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:53,722
You loved him before,

440
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:55,813
you still love him.

441
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,352
Nobody's to blame for that.

442
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:18,399
This stuff go
to the sheriff's office?

443
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:22,790
Yeah, guns for a bunch of old men -
farmers, storekeepers -

444
00:42:22,826 --> 00:42:24,948
and they won't even know
what to do with them.

445
00:42:24,985 --> 00:42:28,947
You think we haven't got a chance
against Spangler? It'd be a miracle.

446
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,845
Cooper's guns could
make a difference.

447
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:37,076
And if that happens,

448
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:40,338
the town will change
its thinking about Cooper.

449
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,804
He'll get to be a big man.

450
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:46,207
If you'd been smart enough to make
him draw in the first place,

451
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:48,162
everything would be settled by now.

452
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,393
He won't be so big,

453
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:54,560
he'll be cut down to size
before this night's over.

454
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:59,308
Load up.

455
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:13,681
How is it going? I got the women
and children in the church.

456
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,637
I found that note you left.

457
00:43:15,673 --> 00:43:19,568
Why didn't you tell me about you
and Helen before I went to see her?

458
00:43:19,605 --> 00:43:23,463
You know how many times I asked her
before she agreed to marry me?

459
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:27,034
She was always hoping
you'd come back.

460
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,608
You've been drinking.
She wants no part of me.

461
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:31,967
I just left her.

462
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:35,717
Helen and I won't be
getting married.

463
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:38,171
Does that answer your question?

464
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:46,337
Did you get that money moved
out of the bank?

465
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,430
There's a trapdoor in the jail.

466
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,775
That ought to keep Spangler guessing
for a little while.

467
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,562
Diego,

468
00:44:22,598 --> 00:44:27,093
since you and Donovan are the only
two around with honest faces...

469
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,589
seems like you should be the ones
to ride into Shelby and find out

470
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:35,951
if the law's caught up with
our old friend Clint Cooper.

471
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:40,685
And what if we find Clint just
kind of hanging around on a tree?

472
00:44:40,722 --> 00:44:43,532
HE LAUGHS

473
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:47,092
Well, now, that would be
a good way of knowing for sure

474
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:49,335
he ain't got to
the bank ahead of us.

475
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:55,700
The main thing for you to find out -
is the money still there?

476
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:58,436
We'll be over in them rocks
until you get back.

477
00:45:24,143 --> 00:45:26,306
Been a long week.

478
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:30,655
Seems to me he should have
been here by now.

479
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,965
Can't depend on Spangler doing what
you expect him to.

480
00:45:46,676 --> 00:45:48,934
I'll go down
and see how Dan's making out.

481
00:45:48,971 --> 00:45:52,209
Make sure there's enough
kerosene on that barricade.

482
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:14,349
Keep walking, Cooper. No noise.

483
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,918
You picked a hell of a time
to start something, Morrison.

484
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:39,086
I waited too long to let Spangler
have the pleasure of killing you.

485
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:57,074
One shot would bring
everybody running.

486
00:46:57,111 --> 00:47:00,009
You ain't worth going to jail for,
Cooper.

487
00:47:00,045 --> 00:47:03,275
Besides, a gun makes it too fast.

488
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,367
Get the rope.

489
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:18,969
You really work hard at hating,
don't you, Morrison?

490
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:23,816
Did you ever see a man
dancing at the end of a rope

491
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:26,844
with his feet just
barely off the ground?

492
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:30,862
He dies slow, Cooper... so slow.

493
00:47:30,897 --> 00:47:35,109
It would make my waiting worth
these last two years.

494
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:38,880
You take away a man's sons,

495
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:41,324
you take away everything
he's got to live for.

496
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:45,525
Too bad your father can't be here

497
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:47,036
to see his son die!

498
00:47:57,593 --> 00:47:59,989
GRUNTING

499
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:06,789
Wait! No guns. He wants it that way,
let him have it that way.

500
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:09,710
Circle him,
I'll get him from this side.

501
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,927
All right, Cooper,

502
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:04,763
you want to hate me for killing you?

503
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:07,889
That's the way it's gonna be.

504
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:21,275
Get those women back in the church!
Get back to your posts!

505
00:49:30,462 --> 00:49:33,563
What the hell...?
I didn't get any choice, Scotty.

506
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,144
Tom's dead. What are you men doing
here? Are you trying to make it easy
for Spangler?

507
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,281
Get back to your posts. Reverend,
you get back to the church.

508
00:49:41,316 --> 00:49:43,970
Cooper's going to hang for this.
He's a killer,

509
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:47,685
just like we all said.
I never thought Cooper would
gun 'em down at a time like this.

510
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:49,205
I told you, get back to your posts.

511
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:54,178
I mean it! You can't believe
I went gunning for the Morrisons!
They wanted to string me up!

512
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:58,232
Well, I don't believe it, Clint.
Helen, you stay out of this.
Give me the gun, Clint.

513
00:49:58,269 --> 00:50:01,280
You're not going to arrest him?

514
00:50:01,317 --> 00:50:04,960
What do you want me to do?
I don't make the laws.

515
00:50:04,997 --> 00:50:08,605
The man has to stand trial
whether I want him to not.

516
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:10,065
Let's go.

517
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:29,080
Dan, you've got no business here.
I had to see if you'd really do it,
you're locking Clint up?

518
00:50:29,116 --> 00:50:30,749
You think I've got a choice?

519
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:36,317
Don't you think I want him
out there on the barricade with us?
His gun gave us a chance.

520
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:39,503
And you're letting
a lot of backbiting idiots
talk you out of it.

521
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,158
Sheriff... something...
something up the road!

522
00:50:44,717 --> 00:50:46,532
Scotty...

523
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:51,670
...good luck.

524
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:55,974
Thanks. I'll need it.

525
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,346
I'll see you later, boy.

526
00:51:01,382 --> 00:51:02,963
The Lord willing.

527
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:33,222
There's only two of them.
Hold it right there. Howdy, Sheriff.

528
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:38,597
Looks like you fellas are getting
ready for some kind
of a turkey shoot.

529
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:44,385
You might even say that a turkey
wouldn't be safe here tonight.

530
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:50,138
You folks expecting some kind
of trouble? Nothing we can't handle.

531
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,071
Where you boys from?
Mountain country. Up around Butte.

532
00:51:57,108 --> 00:52:00,540
We holed up last night at Goose Egg.

533
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:03,732
Joe Wylie's trading post?

534
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:10,614
That's right. We figured we'd head
out to the summer grass country.

535
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:16,034
Better you keep heading.
We were figuring on leaving
some of our money

536
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:17,508
over to the saloon.

537
00:52:17,544 --> 00:52:22,349
There's a creek back about
five miles. Best you stick to water.

538
00:52:23,957 --> 00:52:27,779
Well, that's mighty inhospitable,
Sheriff.

539
00:52:27,816 --> 00:52:30,899
We just don't want any strangers
staying in our town

540
00:52:30,936 --> 00:52:34,753
and getting shot at by Spangler
and his mob.

541
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:38,530
Spangler? Name's enough
to give you the creeps.

542
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:41,069
With that critter coming,
I should think you'd want us

543
00:52:41,106 --> 00:52:44,296
to stay around
and give you some help.

544
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:48,010
You just move back there
slow and easy back down the road.

545
00:52:49,713 --> 00:52:53,877
I wouldn't want any of my men
to mistake you for a turkey.

546
00:52:53,914 --> 00:52:57,148
Now, now, Sheriff,
we ain't ready to be stuck yet,

547
00:52:57,185 --> 00:52:59,592
so thank you very much
for the warning.

548
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:12,543
We could have used them. Why
did you say we had plenty of men?

549
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,481
Think we should have told Spangler
we don't? Spangler?

550
00:53:15,518 --> 00:53:17,533
They just came in to look
the situation over,

551
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,542
tell Spangler which way to move.

552
00:53:19,578 --> 00:53:22,769
You're just guessing. They were
two more guns we could've used.

553
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:24,339
They didn't come from Goose Egg.

554
00:53:24,376 --> 00:53:26,962
Joe Wylie hasn't had that
trading post for six months.

555
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:28,488
Then why didn't you jail them?

556
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:30,887
I thought they might serve us better
if they went back

557
00:53:30,922 --> 00:53:33,248
and told Spangler we were ready
for them.

558
00:53:33,285 --> 00:53:35,535
You think that'll stop him
from coming?

559
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:38,903
With those two showing up,
the gang must be close by.

560
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:43,063
We'll take them on, get back to
Spangler and give him the news.

561
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,109
But that's all the time we've got to
find out whether he's coming or not.

562
00:53:47,146 --> 00:53:49,797
You'd better get back
to the other barricade.

563
00:54:00,796 --> 00:54:03,543
That sheriff was bluffing.

564
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,149
They give you a big song and dance
about having a lot of men.

565
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:10,718
I guess your faces ain't as honest
as I thought they was.

566
00:54:10,754 --> 00:54:13,960
They had you figured.

567
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:16,891
He sure wasn't bluffing about
them barricades.

568
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:20,261
But them gun hands he's
got behind him... Gun hands?

569
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,840
There ain't ten men
and the whole town know

570
00:54:22,877 --> 00:54:25,296
which end of the gun
they shooting.

571
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:28,808
Yeah? Well, I sure ain't finding
out by having them practising on me.

572
00:54:28,844 --> 00:54:32,518
Listen to me! I'll tell you just
when you get shot and when not,

573
00:54:32,554 --> 00:54:34,379
do you understand that?

574
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:36,282
Don't forget it.

575
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:47,436
He's been around too long. Now
he's figuring he'll die of old age!

576
00:54:49,775 --> 00:54:53,993
So...
you don't like them barricades?

577
00:54:54,029 --> 00:54:58,241
They've got to be took, Spang,
and it ain't going to be easy.

578
00:54:58,278 --> 00:55:01,363
You think my brains are
drying up or something?

579
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:09,133
See anything of Clint Cooper?
No, not a sign.

580
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,659
Dirty yellow-livered rat!
Give him a warning.

581
00:55:14,696 --> 00:55:17,361
All right...

582
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,841
Mount up, we're moving in!

583
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:41,844
'All my life, I've had to fight
for something or against it.

584
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,265
'Now, I can't do either.
All I can do is wait.

585
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:49,560
'Wait and try not to think
about what Spangler's going to do
to this town.'

586
00:56:19,911 --> 00:56:21,928
We didn't bluff him.

587
00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:29,745
God have mercy on us.

588
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,462
All right, boys,
this is where we split up.

589
00:56:45,498 --> 00:56:48,357
Lacey, you take your men
and circle the town.

590
00:56:48,393 --> 00:56:51,121
You know
when to come in on the other side.

591
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,850
Just keep them pinned down
at that barricade.

592
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:56,346
Remember,
we'll take care of the rest.

593
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:04,397
OK, let's go!

594
00:57:14,761 --> 00:57:16,924
He'll be here any minute now.

595
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:21,363
Reverend, I'm relying on you to keep
things as calm as possible here.

596
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:30,697
All this killing...
Men with families. Peace...

597
00:57:30,733 --> 00:57:33,640
The word of God...

598
00:57:33,676 --> 00:57:36,808
How does a man
bring them to this country?

599
00:57:36,845 --> 00:57:38,729
You brought them, Reverend.

600
00:57:38,765 --> 00:57:41,992
I can't tell you why there are
men like Spangler.

601
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:47,722
Scotty, is it so impossible
to reason with Spangler?

602
00:57:48,734 --> 00:57:50,314
Reason?

603
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:52,222
Anything is worth trying.

604
00:57:52,259 --> 00:57:54,662
If it would save one life here...

605
00:57:54,699 --> 00:57:57,890
Do you really believe that I can get
Spangler to understand that?

606
00:57:59,829 --> 00:58:01,109
I don't know, Scotty.

607
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:07,318
Sometimes, even an animal can be
made to understand.

608
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,412
All right, Reverend.

609
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,819
Take care of things here.

610
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,979
Helen...

611
00:58:26,723 --> 00:58:28,098
you help him.

612
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:53,904
I'm going out to have a look around.
Out there?

613
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:59,176
You men hold your positions.
Don't fire unless you have to.

614
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,449
I won't have to tell you when.

615
00:59:11,686 --> 00:59:13,501
Scotty!

616
00:59:16,045 --> 00:59:18,663
Scotty, come back! Scotty!

617
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:21,280
Oh, Scotty, come back!

618
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,488
Oh, Scotty, come back!

619
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:29,398
Oh, he's going out there alone.
Cos he thinks he must.

620
00:59:29,435 --> 00:59:34,275
Perhaps he saw me lose faith with
my job. He's keeping faith with his.

621
01:00:11,426 --> 01:00:14,278
Spangler.

622
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:18,907
I'm Sheriff Wade. Sheriff!

623
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:24,394
Well, by gravy,
if this ain't the night of nights.

624
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:29,815
The sheriff himself coming out all
alone to extend the hand of welcome.

625
01:00:29,852 --> 01:00:31,776
You might say that.

626
01:00:31,813 --> 01:00:34,256
Only I don't think it's
the kind of welcome you'll want.

627
01:00:34,292 --> 01:00:37,918
And you didn't want to see old
Spang get plugged,

628
01:00:37,954 --> 01:00:41,543
so you come all the way out here
to warn him, huh?

629
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,163
Something like that.

630
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:44,926
I don't want to see you get shot

631
01:00:44,962 --> 01:00:47,548
and I don't want to
see my town get shot up.

632
01:00:47,585 --> 01:00:51,672
Well now,
that's mighty good arguing.

633
01:00:51,709 --> 01:00:57,723
Exceptin', I ain't got nothing you
want. You've got something I want.

634
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:02,589
Tell you what, Sheriff,
make a deal with you.

635
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:06,042
You let us
get that money peaceable-like,

636
01:01:06,078 --> 01:01:10,871
and you can guarantee your ladies
that we will spend it all on them!

637
01:01:10,907 --> 01:01:13,132
LAUGHING

638
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,410
That's what I came here to tell you.

639
01:01:15,447 --> 01:01:17,189
We knew you were coming,

640
01:01:17,225 --> 01:01:20,250
so we had plenty of time to get
the money out of town.

641
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:23,001
I know how much time you had,
it weren't enough.

642
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:25,791
I'm telling you it isn't here.

643
01:01:25,827 --> 01:01:30,276
And you don't have enough men to
find out whether it is or not.

644
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:35,899
Sheriff, you're either the biggest
liar I've ever seen

645
01:01:35,936 --> 01:01:37,470
or the bravest man.

646
01:01:37,506 --> 01:01:42,063
If you think I'm lying, why don't
you try and take that barricade?

647
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,900
That was just what
I was fixing to do.

648
01:01:45,964 --> 01:01:47,967
Only... you're standing in the way.

649
01:02:54,984 --> 01:02:58,662
The hour's great trial is upon us.
Let us pray.

650
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:04,437
Father in heaven, spare us
from these men of great evil,

651
01:03:04,474 --> 01:03:11,367
who live by terror and bloodshed, and
whose only law is the law of the gun.

652
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:20,079
All right, get them out.

653
01:03:20,115 --> 01:03:23,591
Rest of you men,
get back there, cover us.

654
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:30,971
They're charging,
they're charging! Keep firing!

655
01:03:44,307 --> 01:03:47,297
All right, let's go. Hah!

656
01:03:56,195 --> 01:03:58,943
Now!

657
01:03:58,979 --> 01:04:00,639
Dynamite!

658
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,308
EXPLOSION

659
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,196
HE SHOUTS

660
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,269
THEY WHOOP

661
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,949
What happened, Dan?
Spangler's got the town.

662
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:26,833
From what I can tell,
we're the only two men left.

663
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:29,218
WOMAN SCREAMS

664
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,196
Spangler's gunning for you.

665
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:49,658
The money's gone.
That fool sheriff weren't lying.

666
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,176
I'll be hog-tied,

667
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:55,175
this is the first time I ever killed
a man who told the truth.

668
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:59,137
That money's got to be someplace.
It's gotta be here in town.

669
01:06:01,379 --> 01:06:03,301
We're going to find out where.

670
01:06:06,026 --> 01:06:10,628
You four men keep your eyes open,
Cagle and Donovan, come with me.

671
01:06:23,138 --> 01:06:25,380
They're heading for the church.

672
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:45,343
WOMEN SCREAM

673
01:06:45,379 --> 01:06:48,273
My church is always open,
you didn't have to do that.

674
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:53,079
Well now, Reverend, old Spang
is too ornery for converting,

675
01:06:53,115 --> 01:06:57,847
and too suspicious to just walk in
with his hat in his hand.

676
01:06:57,884 --> 01:06:59,369
Then what do you want?

677
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:04,400
Well now, I wouldn't mind to get an
invite to your church social here.

678
01:07:04,436 --> 01:07:09,348
But, like I always say,
business before pleasure.

679
01:07:09,384 --> 01:07:15,161
The sheriff kept telling me
that the money weren't in the bank.

680
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,797
Right up to the time we killed him.

681
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:21,173
You filthy murderer! Get out!

682
01:07:21,209 --> 01:07:24,207
Isn't it enough that you killed
a lot of innocent men here today?

683
01:07:24,244 --> 01:07:29,677
What do you want now,
the blood of women and children?!
I don't like no babbling women!

684
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:33,486
I never seen a woman yet that
wouldn't run off at the mouth.

685
01:07:33,523 --> 01:07:35,725
You know all I have to do
is have to squeeze a little,

686
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,073
I could mess up
that pretty face of yours.

687
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:40,134
In heaven's name, let her be!

688
01:07:43,504 --> 01:07:49,275
All right, Reverend,
since you're so polite.

689
01:07:49,311 --> 01:07:54,164
Now maybe you'll be polite enough
to tell me where the money is.

690
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,150
We don't know anything
about the money.

691
01:07:57,186 --> 01:07:59,072
Is that so?

692
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:00,959
Well...

693
01:08:02,169 --> 01:08:05,704
Then maybe we'll just take
this little lady as a hostage

694
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:08,055
till somebody around here remembers.

695
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:12,648
She doesn't know, none of us do.
You've got 15 minutes to remember.

696
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:16,909
And this lady'll entertain us
until you do.

697
01:08:16,946 --> 01:08:20,066
So the longer
it takes you to remember,

698
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:22,364
the longer she'll entertain us.

699
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:25,204
Oh, no! Oh!

700
01:08:27,008 --> 01:08:29,107
We'll be in the saloon.

701
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:32,387
Ladies.

702
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,423
Jake,
get them horses in the church.

703
01:08:54,766 --> 01:08:56,735
HORSES' GALLOPING HOOVES

704
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:14,226
How do we do it, Clint? There are six
of them and only two of us.

705
01:09:14,262 --> 01:09:16,229
Wait a minute.
You'll know what's happening.

706
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:27,097
Reverend, what about Helen?

707
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:29,735
I'm glad you let Clint out, Ben.
It's what I came over to do.

708
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:32,998
I don't believe what happened
with the Morrisons tonight
was your fault.

709
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:34,970
Thank you, Reverend,
but what about Helen?

710
01:09:35,006 --> 01:09:37,747
Spangler made it more than clear
what will happen to her

711
01:09:37,783 --> 01:09:39,850
unless we told him
where the money is.

712
01:09:39,887 --> 01:09:41,321
He gave us 15 minutes.

713
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:45,325
Clint, there's no law
in this town now.

714
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:47,769
If you'd consent to wearing
this deputy's badge.

715
01:09:47,806 --> 01:09:49,715
You can't take Spangler alone.

716
01:09:49,751 --> 01:09:51,624
Clint, it doesn't make sense!

717
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:03,402
I need some help, Dan. You don't
need much help being a fool.

718
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:06,972
Maybe I'm a bigger one.
What do you want me to do?

719
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:08,891
I want you to open up your hotel.

720
01:10:08,927 --> 01:10:11,205
I'm going to bring you some guests
so get ready.

721
01:10:11,242 --> 01:10:13,483
Go out the back way,
don't let them see you.

722
01:11:03,089 --> 01:11:04,655
BOTTLE SMASHES

723
01:11:07,438 --> 01:11:10,926
Come on, princess, take a swig.

724
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:14,492
Nothing like it to make a lady
forget she's a lady.

725
01:11:14,528 --> 01:11:17,755
What do you want me to do, drink
to the men you killed here?

726
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:21,134
Ahhh... That's a good idea.

727
01:11:21,171 --> 01:11:26,022
Hey, Cagle, you expect the princess
to drink out of a bottle?

728
01:11:26,059 --> 01:11:27,739
Bring her a glass.

729
01:11:29,825 --> 01:11:31,154
HE CHUCKLES

730
01:11:33,882 --> 01:11:39,372
SPANGLER LAUGHS NASTILY

731
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:42,445
Come on, princess, drink up.

732
01:11:43,517 --> 01:11:49,200
Enough of this stuff and you and me
can get real friendly in 15 minutes.

733
01:11:49,236 --> 01:11:53,199
You pig! You dirty rotten pig!

734
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:57,652
GANG LAUGH

735
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:00,237
SPANGLERJOINS IN THE LAUGHTER

736
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:02,740
How do you like that, boys?

737
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:06,989
The only one in the whole town
that ain't afraid of old Spang

738
01:12:07,025 --> 01:12:09,091
and it turns out to be a woman!

739
01:12:11,912 --> 01:12:15,351
Oh, a real fighting woman!

740
01:12:15,388 --> 01:12:16,765
Aargh!

741
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:17,846
Ow! Take that!

742
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:23,999
Ha-ha-ha! Yes, give me one like that
every time!

743
01:12:26,187 --> 01:12:27,752
Full of gumption.

744
01:12:30,056 --> 01:12:31,670
BOTTLE SMASHES

745
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:33,251
Hey, Spang...

746
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:34,797
We got company.

747
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:41,604
The Reverend?

748
01:12:41,641 --> 01:12:44,866
Coming to tell us about the money?

749
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:48,048
An old friend of yours.
Clint Cooper.

750
01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:52,938
Clint coming here alone
to get hisself killed?

751
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,897
Well now, boys, you just get ready
to accommodate him.

752
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:21,483
Donovan, Cagle.

753
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,945
Jake.

754
01:13:25,343 --> 01:13:29,744
Well, Spang, never thought
I'd see you twice in the same day.

755
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:32,741
I don't figure
it'll ever happen again,

756
01:13:32,777 --> 01:13:35,662
seeing as you
ain't got long to live.

757
01:13:35,698 --> 01:13:39,281
If you want to kill me
you have to take the leavings.

758
01:13:39,317 --> 01:13:41,532
If the town gets through hanging me.

759
01:13:41,568 --> 01:13:43,628
I figured they'd
at least elect you mayor

760
01:13:43,665 --> 01:13:46,560
since you were the one
that warned them I was coming.

761
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:48,769
Heh.

762
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:51,985
They been over to help fight you.

763
01:13:52,021 --> 01:13:53,648
They threw me in jail.

764
01:13:56,919 --> 01:13:58,543
Sit down.

765
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:06,999
Have a drink. On the house.

766
01:14:08,993 --> 01:14:11,200
Jail, huh?

767
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,327
How come you could get loose?

768
01:14:14,364 --> 01:14:18,622
A good friend of mine let me out.
Figured you'd be gunning for me.

769
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,617
He wasn't far wrong,
you cost me a lot of men.

770
01:14:21,653 --> 01:14:26,695
You can always get men
but you can't always get $100, 000.

771
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,145
100, 000? You know something I don't?

772
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:35,359
It could be.

773
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:37,353
Like where that money's hid?

774
01:14:38,816 --> 01:14:42,494
Come on, boy, don't keep old Spang
hung up by his hair,

775
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,452
where's she at?

776
01:14:44,488 --> 01:14:47,229
I could lead you to it.

777
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:48,894
Hear that, boys?!

778
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:53,000
Old Clint's gonna save us
a mess of looking.

779
01:14:53,036 --> 01:14:54,409
Now if that ain't...

780
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,639
Wait a minute.

781
01:14:58,711 --> 01:15:02,046
If you know where the money's hid,
how come you didn't grab it

782
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:05,678
and light out of here?
You didn't have to come to me.

783
01:15:05,715 --> 01:15:09,276
Spang, you used to be
a pretty good horse trader.

784
01:15:09,312 --> 01:15:11,043
HE CHUCKLES

785
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:14,802
Ain't nobody never sold Spang
a horse with buck teeth yet.

786
01:15:14,838 --> 01:15:18,524
Then you ought to recognise
a good deal when you see one.

787
01:15:18,561 --> 01:15:20,127
You take the money.

788
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,161
I'll take the girl.

789
01:15:24,864 --> 01:15:26,830
Her?!

790
01:15:26,867 --> 01:15:29,512
Why not, she's got all of her teeth.

791
01:15:31,997 --> 01:15:36,457
I'll say she has, and she
bites hard with all of 'em.

792
01:15:36,494 --> 01:15:39,486
You mean to say you got a yen
for this filly

793
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:43,305
worth $100, 000 in cold cash?

794
01:15:43,342 --> 01:15:46,272
I told you I had a personal reason
for coming back here.

795
01:15:49,057 --> 01:15:50,445
Well, by gravy.

796
01:15:51,852 --> 01:15:53,915
What about it? Deal?

797
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:58,259
No offence, princess,

798
01:15:58,296 --> 01:16:02,412
but the way I look at it is
women gets old and fat

799
01:16:02,448 --> 01:16:05,535
but money always stays the same.

800
01:16:05,572 --> 01:16:07,157
You got a deal.

801
01:16:11,695 --> 01:16:14,482
Now, let's go dig up
them ring backs.

802
01:16:14,519 --> 01:16:15,767
We'll do it my way.

803
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:20,360
The girl goes with me.
You can send two men, two.

804
01:16:20,396 --> 01:16:22,023
I don't aim to get ganged up on.

805
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:26,862
Oh, now, Clint you ought
to trust me better than that.

806
01:16:26,899 --> 01:16:33,305
I trust you, Spang, you trust me,
but we just can't trust each other.

807
01:16:33,342 --> 01:16:34,829
HE LAUGHS

808
01:16:34,866 --> 01:16:38,294
Clint, you old rock, you can horse
trade for me any time!

809
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:43,468
Cagle, Donovan,
give old Clint here helping hand.

810
01:16:47,817 --> 01:16:51,091
SPANGLER LAUGHS

811
01:16:51,127 --> 01:16:52,217
Wait!

812
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:57,456
Something for you to remember,
princess.

813
01:16:57,493 --> 01:17:01,486
In case anyone starts dealing
from the bottom of the deck.

814
01:17:01,522 --> 01:17:05,479
My men here ain't got no religion
about killing a woman.

815
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:27,515
I come into this town
for money and women.

816
01:17:29,663 --> 01:17:32,937
You know, danged if I can think
of one reason Clint gave me

817
01:17:32,973 --> 01:17:34,312
for changing my mind.

818
01:17:36,066 --> 01:17:38,616
Go watch where they're going.

819
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:53,376
A hotel? Where you got that money
hidden, in a mattress?

820
01:17:53,412 --> 01:17:54,549
Not exactly.

821
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:15,369
Get that junk out of there,
there's a trapdoor underneath.

822
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:17,574
Go on, do as he says.

823
01:18:30,967 --> 01:18:33,360
There's no trapdoor in here.

824
01:18:33,397 --> 01:18:35,717
What are you trying to pull?

825
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:38,054
Stand still
or you'll never find out.

826
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:44,017
You think Spangler's going to
let you get away with your skin?

827
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,731
Back up and shut up.

828
01:18:52,323 --> 01:18:55,075
Get the rope, Dan.

829
01:18:55,111 --> 01:18:56,536
Well?

830
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:00,255
They're still in there.

831
01:19:01,854 --> 01:19:05,128
This cuts the odds by two,
what about the others?

832
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:06,255
They'll be along.

833
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:09,828
Helen, you'd better go upstairs.

834
01:19:09,864 --> 01:19:11,006
Hurry.

835
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,264
BOTTLE CLATTERS

836
01:19:32,313 --> 01:19:33,344
That does it.

837
01:19:39,445 --> 01:19:42,980
Too bad Clint ain't married
to the princess.

838
01:19:43,016 --> 01:19:45,472
She'd make a fine-looking widow.

839
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:57,011
You sure called a turn
on Spangler coming after us.

840
01:19:57,048 --> 01:20:01,496
All you have to do is
think like a corkscrew. Get ready.

841
01:20:12,585 --> 01:20:14,838
Clint, Spangler's
gonna be coming for you.

842
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,900
That's the whole idea.

843
01:20:21,093 --> 01:20:22,766
Clint, I want you to live.

844
01:20:26,766 --> 01:20:28,878
If I do, it'll be because of this.

845
01:20:46,714 --> 01:20:48,279
Take a look through the window.

846
01:20:55,953 --> 01:20:57,518
You see anything?

847
01:20:57,555 --> 01:20:59,285
Nothing.

848
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,887
Get around the side, try to move in.

849
01:21:07,288 --> 01:21:08,332
Cagle!

850
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,204
Is Cooper still around?

851
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:15,614
You in there?

852
01:21:15,651 --> 01:21:20,203
You move your heads again,
they'll come off.

853
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:23,525
What's the matter, have you
got your ears plugged up, too?!

854
01:21:23,561 --> 01:21:29,338
Get in there and untie them.
I'll cover you.

855
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:32,375
Get in there!

856
01:21:52,753 --> 01:21:56,133
Hold it! That's far enough.

857
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:57,161
Drop it.

858
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:02,095
Well, what are you waiting for?
Untie him!

859
01:22:02,132 --> 01:22:04,259
They can't, Spang.

860
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:07,380
You have to come in
and untie them yourself.

861
01:22:08,842 --> 01:22:12,716
You conniving snake of a...

862
01:22:12,752 --> 01:22:16,026
I thought I better double-cross you
before you double-crossed me.

863
01:22:19,446 --> 01:22:22,376
All right, unbuckle it.

864
01:22:22,413 --> 01:22:24,583
The other hand.

865
01:22:43,649 --> 01:22:44,870
Drop it!

866
01:22:49,853 --> 01:22:51,074
GUNSHOT

867
01:22:57,476 --> 01:23:01,296
SHOTS

868
01:23:04,077 --> 01:23:07,611
SHOTS

869
01:23:30,668 --> 01:23:33,228
Are you still there, Spang?

870
01:23:33,264 --> 01:23:38,151
Yeah, Cooper, I'm here and I'll
still be here for your funeral!

871
01:23:40,157 --> 01:23:42,956
You'd better go into
another business.

872
01:23:42,993 --> 01:23:47,662
After today, you couldn't raise
enough men to raid
an old folks home.

873
01:23:47,698 --> 01:23:52,330
We'll see about that. Any time you
want to come out, I'll be waiting.

874
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:20,778
You wait here.

875
01:24:54,944 --> 01:24:57,446
SHOTS

876
01:25:03,547 --> 01:25:06,003
SHOTS

877
01:25:12,837 --> 01:25:15,483
GUNSHOTS OUTSIDE

878
01:25:24,027 --> 01:25:25,212
GUNSHOT OUTSIDE

879
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:37,328
Helen! Clint said to stay put.

880
01:25:53,902 --> 01:25:58,149
There's only two of us left, Spang.
We can settle it quick.

881
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:07,197
All right, Clint. You call the play.

882
01:26:07,234 --> 01:26:09,799
Just like old times, Spang.

883
01:26:09,836 --> 01:26:12,279
I won't draw till
you go for your gun.

884
01:26:15,404 --> 01:26:16,530
Fair enough.

885
01:26:26,113 --> 01:26:27,334
I'm coming out.

886
01:26:52,213 --> 01:26:55,986
Guess we're gonna have to forget
about old times, Clint.

887
01:26:57,396 --> 01:27:00,872
Cagle is fixing to shoot you
in the back.

888
01:27:00,908 --> 01:27:04,889
That's older than old, Spang.

889
01:27:04,925 --> 01:27:07,273
You don't expect me to swallow that.

890
01:27:09,763 --> 01:27:12,017
Have it your way, Clint.

891
01:27:13,235 --> 01:27:18,277
But Cagle ain't sentimental like us.

892
01:27:18,714 --> 01:27:21,410
Any particular place
you want to get it, Clint?

893
01:27:23,642 --> 01:27:26,420
Any last words?

894
01:27:33,243 --> 01:27:34,621
Yeah.

895
01:27:35,657 --> 01:27:36,799
Draw!

896
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,997
Oh, Clint.

897
01:27:59,034 --> 01:28:01,068
Now don't go blaming yourself.

898
01:28:01,103 --> 01:28:03,101
You did what you had to do.

899
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:06,524
I know.

900
01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:12,444
It takes all kinds of tools
to clear the land.

901
01:28:14,383 --> 01:28:16,542
I don't think we'll be needing
this one any more.

902
01:28:20,004 --> 01:28:21,190
Come on.
