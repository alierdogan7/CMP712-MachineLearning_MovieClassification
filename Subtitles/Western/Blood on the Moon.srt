1
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,678
BLOOD ON THE MOON

2
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,830
Who's that?

3
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,869
Put a light on yourself.

4
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,268
With what?

5
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,956
Man, man. I didn't
know anyone was here.

6
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,038
- Well, I had a fire.
- I couldn't have stopped 'em if I'd seen it.

7
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,869
I don't think I've seen you
around here before, have I?

8
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,876
Nope.

9
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,639
- You c ome over the peaks?
- Yeah. With an outfit.

10
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,430
What are you doing here?

11
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,755
I'm waiting for you to clear out of my camp.
Then I'll gonna turn in, if I can find my blankets.

12
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,910
My camp just below.
Maybe you better come along.

13
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,032
We can make it double that far.

14
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,518
I guess I can do with a cup of coffee.

15
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,312
Hey it's me, Bart.

16
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,737
Who is he?

17
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,795
I don't know.

18
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,159
I was bringin' my gather down the creek when they cleaned out his camp.
So I brought him along.

19
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,433
You come over the peaks?

20
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,629
That's right.

21
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,479
Why didn't you come to the pass?

22
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,558
There's no law says a man has to stick
to a wagon road, is there?

23
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,152
My men caught your horse.
It's branded "Lazy J".

24
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,051
I don't know it.

25
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,870
Don't you?

26
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,313
Wait a minute, Cap.

27
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,196
Make a fellow feel right at home don't you?

28
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,154
All right my name is Lufton,
John Lufton.

29
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,550
This is Cap Willis, my foreman.

30
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,110
A month ago, nobody would've asked you any questions.
It's different now.

31
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,355
Who are you?

32
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,234
Jim Garry. "Lazy J" is Texas brand.

33
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,395
Headed for Sun Dust?

34
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,915
That's right.

35
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,270
You know anybody there?

36
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,156
Nope.

37
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,713
Alright. I apologize for my steers.

38
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,954
We'll replace your outfit.
Make yourself comfortable.

39
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,793
Give him something to eat, Joe.

40
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,719
- Rotten night.
- Yeah.

41
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,117
Sorry we have to be so rough on you Garry,
but you're a loose rider.

42
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,998
We gotta watch them these days.

43
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,508
- Little argument over grazing land.
- Oh.

44
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,992
Yeah. For five years now, I've been supplying the
beef to feed the Indians here on the Reservation.

45
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,192
This year they've got new agent.

46
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,672
Fellow named Pindalest.

47
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,393
He's rejected my beef
and he's kicking me off the Reservation grass.

48
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,431
That doesn't explain about the loose riders.

49
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,158
No, but I haven't got any graze to move to
except what I used to claim in the Basin across the river.

50
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,035
And there seems to be a little difference of opinion now
as to who owns that.

51
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,155
Me or the homesteaders that have been drifting in.

52
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,834
I'm moving back.

53
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,950
They'll fight.

54
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,195
Yeah, I reckon they will.

55
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,952
A newcomer moved in this summer.
He's got 'em organized.

56
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,069
Name's Riling.

57
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,759
Still doesn't explain about the loose riders.

58
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,718
He's bringing in gun men.

59
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,039
Nobody can blame you for being careful.

60
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,519
I'm afraid you don't get it.

61
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,799
- Get what?
- This.

62
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,310
It's work for me or -
keep on riding.

63
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,036
And if I don't?

64
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,272
I'll give you a day in Sun Dust
and then you'd better drift.

65
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,279
Sleep on it, Garry.

66
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,238
Much obliged for the outfit.

67
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,479
Working for me Garry?

68
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,908
No, I guess I'll be drifting.

69
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,319
Well, it's your choice.

70
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,678
D'you mind dropping a note
at Block house with my women folk?

71
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,636
That's my place over in the Basin.
It's on your way.

72
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,109
Glad to.

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,035
Thanks.

74
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,875
Good luck.

75
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,990
Hold it! I'm riding through.

76
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,593
Come on out and talk.

77
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,672
Don't care who you kill, do you?

78
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,918
Maybe that'll cool you off.

79
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,272
- Got a note from John Lufton.
- I'm Carol Lufton.

80
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,670
- You're working for us now?
- No.

81
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,271
<i>Bringing herd across river
at Rock Ford tonight. - Dad</ I></i>

82
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,594
Did Dad say when he was coming
down from the Reservation?

83
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,358
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you.

84
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,033
Stop right there.

85
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,718
You're the man that shot at me by the river.

86
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,715
Yeah, I guess I am.

87
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,956
Well I'm gonna show you how it feels.

88
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,639
Put that gun down, Amy.

89
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,630
Amy stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

90
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,239
Stop it! You hear?

91
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,715
Have you gone crazy?

92
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,911
- What's going on here?
- Ask him.

93
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,111
I was only giving him back a little
of what he gave me.

94
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,231
- What about it?
- She's right.

95
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,716
Why has Dad had to guard at the river
for a week if it isn't to keep the riders from crossing?

96
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,831
- What are you doing here?
- He brought a note from Dad.

97
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,837
Well, I tried to tell her
but she wouldn't give me a chance.

98
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,996
Alright you delivered the note.
Now, get out.

99
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,154
Well, for once you bit off
more than you can chew.

100
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,394
- That him?
- Yeah, what do you think?

101
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,873
- Hmm, maybe.
- Maybe my foot, Manker! You gotta get hit on the head with it?

102
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,595
- Lufton threatened to get one, didn't he?
- Well you ain't sure it's him.

103
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,076
I cut his sign going into Lufton's ranch this morning
and I cut it going out.

104
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,470
John Lufton's got a right to hire a range detective
if he wants to, Milo.

105
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,438
Not to watch us, he ain't.

106
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,234
Well, let Riling handle it.
And no shooting.

107
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,510
Take the third stall.
The boy'll bring you some hay.

108
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,112
Any idea who that fellow is?

109
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,795
"Lazy J" is the brand but I don't know it.

110
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,989
He say anything?

111
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,714
- He asked where he could find Tate Riling.
- Riling?

112
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,911
- I'll take it at the table Barney.
- Sure.

113
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,151
Lufton's watcher just drifted in.

114
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,597
- Cattle detective?
- What else?

115
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,271
- He asked for Riling.
- Riling?

116
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,596
If he's Lufton's watcher,
what d'you figure he wants with Riling?

117
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,439
Let's find out.

118
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,516
Yeah. Why not?

119
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,194
But how? Riling ain't here.

120
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,035
Sure he is.

121
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,196
Where?

122
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,558
Right here. Eh, Nels?

123
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,753
Well, let's wait 'til Riling gets here.
We wouldn't want to make no mistake.

124
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,594
Alright, Nels.

125
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,119
Maybe you want the law to come in here and find out what we're planning to do.
So he can go back and tell Lufton.

126
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,356
Alright, Milo, alright.

127
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,349
I'll tell Barney.

128
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,112
Know where I can find Tate Riling?

129
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,874
Back table.

130
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,273
Ace, Queen, Mitch.

131
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,475
Tate Riling?

132
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,171
That's me.

133
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,915
I'd like to talk to you.

134
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,389
Go ahead.

135
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,509
These are my friends.

136
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,797
I'm looking for a riding job.

137
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,071
Who said I was hiring riders?

138
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,211
I heard it.

139
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,039
You hear what I'm hirin' them for?

140
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,189
I heard that too.

141
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,371
Why yes.

142
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,393
Dumb play boys.

143
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,155
Stay set Army.

144
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,949
He's headin' for the street.

145
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,114
Mr. Riling, Lufton's watcher's in town.
Asking for you.

146
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,197
And he wanted a ridin' job with us, Tate.

147
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,596
- Then go get him.
- There he is.

148
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,954
Jim Garry!

149
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,230
Hello, Tate.

150
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,351
This is Jim Garry. The man I sent for.

151
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,676
He's no range detective.

152
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,917
What went wrong, Jim? What Happened?
Who started this?

153
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,917
Ask these jokers here, Tate.

154
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,029
If that's Garry, what's he doing at Lufton's?

155
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,708
Were you at the Lufton's place?

156
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,239
Yeah he was. I seen him.

157
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,035
That's right. I delivered a not from him to his women folk.
What about it?

158
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,595
Well it's Lufton's outfit that's tryin' to
run us out of the country, Jim.

159
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,789
Am I supposed to know that?

160
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,430
Why no. I forgot.

161
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,710
I never wrote Jim about our fight with Lufton.

162
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,195
I told him I needed him and asked him to come on up.

163
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,074
Now stop chewin' leather and
go and get yourself a drink.

164
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,994
Sam old Jim, when lightning strikes
you're there.

165
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,394
It wasn't a fair test.

166
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,192
Come on, let's get you a room.

167
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,196
It's good to see you again Jim.
I wasn't sure you'd come.

168
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,435
I'm here.

169
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,234
Yeah. I heard things haven't been
breaking too good lately.

170
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,750
Well, that's a bootless job - trail driving.

171
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,155
I told you that we split up two years ago.

172
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
Understand you fin'lly got your own herd.

173
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,838
And two weeks later I saw 'em strung out along the
bottomlands. Dead of the Fever.

174
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,635
We'll forget it. There's money in this deal.
Big money.

175
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,428
- Barney, how about a room for my friend here?
- Sure.

176
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,268
I wouldn't wish one on him if was a friend of mine though.

177
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,149
Oh. This has got your name on it.
Somebody fired it through the back window during the ruckus.

178
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,113
We're goin' out tonight fellows.
I know where Lufton's crossing.

179
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,076
- How do you know?
- Never mind, I know.

180
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,238
Be ready to leave in half an hour.
Drink up, Jim.

181
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,512
Wait here, I'll be right back.

182
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,314
I suppose you'd like to know what
this is all about?

183
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,317
I have been kinda wondering, yeah.

184
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,956
Well I'm not gonna tell you, Jim.

185
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,708
I'm gonna show you.

186
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,196
Come in.

187
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,959
Jim, this is Mr. Pindalest. United States agent for
the Ute Indians over at the Reservation

188
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,275
This is Jim Garry, my partner.

189
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,469
How do you do?

190
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,956
You didn't tell me before about a partner.

191
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,513
Well I'm telling you now.

192
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,355
Before we go on any further,
I want to understood how he'll figure in this.

193
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,079
You mean money?

194
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,355
Don't worry Pindalest.
I'll share with Jim.

195
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,555
Hmm.

196
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,749
Well, here's the, uh, item we were talking
about the other day.

197
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,871
Think you'll find it satisfactory.

198
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,393
United States dollars are usually satisfactory,
aren't they?

199
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,991
Now look. I told you Garry is my partner, Pindalest.

200
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,952
What I know, he knows..

201
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,798
So relax and sit down.

202
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,513
No, I won't stay.

203
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,189
Scared?

204
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,195
Scared?

205
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,992
Just cautious, Riling.

206
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,479
Well that's our partner, Jim.
Cautious...

207
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,517
And this is our working capital,
courtesy of the United States Government.

208
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,551
There's enough there to buy me 2,500 head
of Lufton's beef, four dollars a head.

209
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,115
That's cheap enough, isn't it?

210
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,399
It's too cheap. Where is the catch?

211
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,513
There isn't any.

212
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,390
You, um, met Lufton, you say?

213
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,511
Yeah, I camped with him last night.

214
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,912
Did he tell you that Pindalest has ordered
his cattle off the Reservation?

215
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,678
Yeah. He said he'd refused his beef.

216
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,829
And did he tell you that the army from Fort Liggett,

217
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,669
has orders to seize the cattle if they're not off
the Reservation by the first of November?

218
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,789
No he didn't tell me that.

219
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,558
Well that's the layout Jim.

220
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,712
I've organized these two bit ranchers

221
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,718
to fight any move Lufton makes to push his
herd across the river and into the Basin here.

222
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,999
The ranchers'll fight because they figure
they're fighting for their own range.

223
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,670
But the truth is, they'd be fighting for me.

224
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,077
Now withut any graze to move to,

225
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,192
Lufton'll be caught on the Reservation
and his herd seized.

226
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,230
So what does he do?

227
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,669
Sell?

228
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,993
To me. Cheap.
Because he'd rather get a little money than lose everything.

229
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,117
Sounds like you've got him over a barrel.

230
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,475
I have!

231
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,310
I buy 'em cheap and sell 'em back to the Government
through Pindalest for full contract price.

232
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,871
Your cut will be ten thousand dollars.

233
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,469
What do I have to do to earn it?

234
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,992
Lufton's tough. My ranchers aren't.
You'll make up the difference.

235
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,075
I see.

236
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,918
I've mixed up a lot of things, Tate.
But up to now, I've never been hired for my gun.

237
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,319
Can you afford to be particular?

238
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,434
No I guess I can't.

239
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,071
Now you're talking, Jim.
I'll meet you down in the lobby in 10 minutes.

240
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,439
Come on, slow poke.
Don't you want to know if Dad got across?

241
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,709
Of course.

242
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,390
What's the matter?
Did I get you out the bed too early?

243
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,195
I'm worried about dad.
I hope he didn't have trouble crossing last night.

244
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,073
Could only be trouble if Riling found out about it.

245
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,712
Nobody's crossed here.

246
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,558
Looking for someone, Miss Lufton?

247
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,359
So you're one of 'em?

248
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,114
- I guess dad wasn't so wrong about you after all.
- Wrong?

249
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,835
He must've spotted you for one of Riling's
gun men the minute he saw you.

250
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,388
Funny isn't it Riling?

251
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,434
But not to you. By now Dad's probably got his herd
across the river some place else

252
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,790
while you wait here at Rocky Ford to throw him back.

253
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,877
- Is that why we're here?
- Isn't it?

254
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,274
Simply because Dad was smart enough to give this saddle
tramp a not that he was sure to read.

255
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,995
He knew he'd tell you and decoy you over here.

256
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,030
How do you like it now, Kris?
You and your son?

257
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,276
Why you aren't even being led by a smart crook.

258
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,591
We're only fighting for what belongs to us, Miss Amy.

259
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,155
You didn't fight for it before Riling gave you the idea.

260
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,068
Why didn't you talk to dad, Kris?
Talk to him.

261
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,749
You use to work for him.
You know he's not unreasonable.

262
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,832
Call it unreasonable to kick us off our land?

263
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,148
I don't believe I've seen you around here before.

264
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,794
- You fighting for your own graze too?
- No ma'am.

265
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,069
And you?

266
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,590
I thought you were all old timers, fighting for land
you settled on, Kris?

267
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,197
At least that's in the open now.

268
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,080
Paid gunmen against working riders.

269
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,517
You did read that note, didn't you?

270
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,471
No.

271
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,358
You're a poor liar.

272
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,275
Yes.

273
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,558
Well. Lufton's across the Massacre.

274
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,957
John Lufton's no fool, mister.

275
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,912
Garry did not read that note.

276
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,353
- Then where did you get the tip?
- None of your business, Milo.

277
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,637
I got a wrong tip and I won't get another.

278
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,751
Well if you don't like it, Milo.
Just ride it on out.

279
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,393
Lufton's across the river with that herd.

280
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,910
Yeah, sure. But steers have got legs.
They can be driven back.

281
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,919
The thing to do is find 'em
before Lufton can get 'em scattered.

282
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,394
After that we can move.

283
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,593
Didn't you notice how them four always stick together?

284
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,231
Why not?. Reardan and Shotten work for Riling.

285
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,229
Garry's a friend just came in to help.

286
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,389
I can buy me that kind of a friend
for $75 a month and no questions asked.

287
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,473
You know, Lufton's smart.

288
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,631
Yeah he's smart enough to spot me.

289
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,233
He had spotted Shotten and Reardan
before I even knew they were there.

290
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,836
They are a couple of beauties.
Who are they?

291
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,192
Doesn't matter who they are, Jim.

292
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,675
The thing that matters is, they don't scare easy.

293
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,432
Well, it's pretty crude.

294
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,868
Not so crude.

295
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,958
I've made everybody swallow it but Lufton,
and I'll make him swallow it too.

296
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,510
Shotten, Reardan and me.
Hired gunmen.

297
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,755
Shotten and Reardan will get paid in gold eagles.

298
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,599
You get paid in thousands.

299
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,230
Yeah. Only difference between us is the price.

300
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,153
All right boys, cut for town.
I'll be in touch with you.

301
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,038
Tate, I didn't know it was a trick of Dad.
I swear I didn't. Until I heard Amy say it.

302
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,914
Of course you didn't, darling.
Forget it.

303
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,878
It's done and now we've got to fix it.

304
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,918
But I'm glad in a way.

305
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,317
I couldn't bear it this morning when I though
you and Dad were fighting.

306
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,317
It isn't for you, Carol.

307
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,114
But I have to do what I'm doing.
You see that, don't you?

308
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,629
- Yes, Tate.
- You see, I'm a poor man, darling.

309
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,792
Money has to come hard to me.

310
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,879
Nothing for me to do but join up with men
just like myself and fight for what little I've got.

311
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,673
I tried to make Dad see both sides.

312
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,872
But he's just as sure he's right as you homesteaders are.

313
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,399
We've got to fight.

314
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,355
But he's across now.
What are you gonna do?

315
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,273
I'm not gonna ask you to risk your dad's life, darling.

316
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,916
But I am going to ask you to help.

317
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,434
Find out where he's holding the herd that he crossed.

318
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,830
and get word back to me as soon as you can.

319
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,915
You won't let any harm come to Dad, won't you?

320
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,355
You know you can trust me, darling.

321
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,236
Still a lot easier when we go through the gap.

322
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,550
- We ought to make it by noon.
- Yes.

323
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,598
I scatter 'em in the scrub pinion
west of Avery's patch.

324
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,199
Amy!
What the devil are you doing here?

325
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,630
You didn't think I'd stay home
when you're this close.

326
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,549
This is no place for you.
I told Bart to tell you girls I'd be home by noon.

327
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,230
I told 'em and it didn't do no good.
She was bent on coming along.

328
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,069
I couldn't wait.

329
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,232
All right, Cap, get 'em started.

330
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,998
Bart says you crossed without any trouble?

331
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,078
Yeah. We're primed for it but didn't come.

332
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,473
I think I know why.

333
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,071
Did a rider name of Garry drift into the ranch
yesterday with a note?

334
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,077
You mean that hired gunman of Riling's?

335
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,837
So I had him pegged right.

336
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,993
Too bad, he was a nice seeming fellow.
Too nice to read that note.

337
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,630
But he did.

338
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,516
Do you think this Garry's a killer?

339
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,111
Joined up with Riling, didn't he?

340
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,914
Get out of here, Amy!

341
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,631
I'll make Riling remember this.

342
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,312
They'll run 'till they're worn out.

343
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,757
Four days to the deadline.

344
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,516
It'll take us a week to round 'em up
and get 'em off the Reservation again.

345
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,159
It's young Barden.

346
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,791
I hope it wouldn't come to this.

347
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,398
Just a month ago me and him
went to a shindig together.

348
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,072
Yeah, he was a nice boy.

349
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,309
Well, what do you want?

350
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,872
It's about your Barden.

351
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,435
He was killed on the raid.

352
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,590
I figured maybe that's what happened

353
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,718
when he didn't come home.

354
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,034
I was with him when he got hit.

355
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,994
Nothing I can do.

356
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,637
It's a big price to pay for
a little bit of graze.

357
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,795
Too bad you had to get mixed up in this fight, Barden.

358
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,991
I joined up with the other small ranchers

359
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,794
'cause I figured their fight was my fight.

360
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,434
We ain't being paid to fight, mister.

361
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,476
I'm sorry about your son, Mr. Barden.

362
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,113
You can believe that if you want to.

363
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,398
Sure. Sure.

364
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,030
I've lived here more than of half my life

365
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,438
with my wife and my son.

366
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,108
She died about four years ago.

367
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,710
And now...

368
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,319
Now he's gone.

369
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,392
Go on in the Hotel, Amy.

370
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,518
I told you to ride on through.

371
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,632
- So you did?
- You're time's up, get started.

372
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,557
- Get out of here, Amy.
- No.

373
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,591
- Go on into the hotel.
- No.

374
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,559
Don't move, Lufton.

375
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,593
Your drift, Shotten.

376
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,958
Get that girl out of there.

377
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,559
I said, drift.

378
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,874
What are we waitin' for?

379
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,071
But this is what Riling wants.

380
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,828
He said so.

381
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,755
That's your horse, Reardan.
Get moving.

382
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,439
I ain't taking orders from you.

383
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,434
All right, Reardan. Any time you want.

384
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,319
Make up your mind.

385
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,115
I won't wait.

386
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,991
You won't be this lucky next time, Lufton.

387
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,158
I don't get it, Garry.
I just don't get it.

388
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,717
You're riding on, aren't you?

389
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,118
I'm glad. Not for us, but for you.

390
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,037
I want to thank you for this.
I want to apologize too, for what I said to you.

391
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,792
Don't let a man's whim fool you.

392
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,955
I haven't.

393
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,632
<i>COMMISSARY
12 MILES</i>

394
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,196
What do you want, amigo?

395
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,635
Whiskey.

396
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,638
Would you be looking for me?

397
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,230
I ain't looking for anybody, mister.

398
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,393
Is that you, Kris?

399
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,153
I heard about Fred.
I'm sorry, Kris.

400
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,879
I'll make Lufton pay for that.

401
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,914
What good'll that do? Fred's...

402
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,309
Fred's dead.

403
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,552
It'll make me feel better.

404
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,469
Did you come all the way over here to
tell me that?

405
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,356
No. I missed you this morning.

406
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,109
I didn't know you'd be here.
Why are you?

407
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,034
I'm leavin' the country.

408
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,878
But Kris, the fight's almost won.

409
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,591
Lufton's herd is stampeded half way up
the Three Braves.

410
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,594
Who cares?

411
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,995
Hey Jim, where have you been?.
I've searched the country for you.

412
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,349
How'd you find me?

413
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,515
Settlemeir said you took the Commissary road.
I took a chance.

414
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,989
What's up?

415
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,554
Let's have a drink. I've got news.

416
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,315
Give me a glass and a handful of cigars
and then get out.

417
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,475
On the level, Jim.

418
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,153
What are you doing here?

419
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,629
Running out.

420
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,310
Any reason?

421
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,149
Two. Shotten and Reardan.

422
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,790
I never heard of you running away
from a pair like that.

423
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,390
- Well, I. I never did.
- Then why?

424
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,952
They were gonna kill Lufton in cold blood
when I stepped in.

425
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,353
I'm glad you did.

426
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,831
Are you?

427
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,199
Jim, what's eatin' you?

428
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,436
Why we've got more at stake here
than a bag of marbles.

429
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,029
You mean, you have.

430
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,598
Jim, Lufton isn't dead.

431
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,473
He isn't even hurt.

432
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,360
And after that stamped he hasn't got a chance.

433
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,598
- Then why bother about me?
- Because, I need you.

434
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,280
You don't think Lufton'll do
business with me, do you?

435
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,756
No.

436
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,479
No he'd rather lose his herd.

437
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,795
Exactly.

438
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,668
But today you stepped in
and saved his life.

439
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,233
He won't forget that.

440
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,597
So when you ride up with an offer,
he'll take it.

441
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,537
Because he has to.

442
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,870
Why not?

443
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,991
It's, something you wouldn't understand.

444
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,070
Try me.

445
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,479
It starts with your double cross
of a bunch of poor jugheaded homesteaders

446
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,477
and the hiring of gun hands.

447
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,076
It goes on to you making love to man's daughter

448
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,510
to get her to turn against her own father.

449
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,597
And your try for Lufton yesterday...

450
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,074
It goes past that

451
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,796
to the death of Kris Barden's son.
And it winds up right here.

452
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,953
with Reardan waitin' outside to see
if I go with you

453
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,832
or he shoots me in the back.

454
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,359
I've seen dogs that wouldn't claim
you for a son, Tate.

455
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,119
All right, get off.

456
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,153
I said, get off.

457
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,955
Hold it.

458
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,349
Give him time.

459
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,188
Can you make it to your horse?

460
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,790
Get out.

461
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,309
Why'd you do it?

462
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,154
I always wanted to shoot one of you

463
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,836
and he was the handiest.

464
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,835
Get out.

465
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,713
What are you doing here?

466
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,950
I want to see Lufton.

467
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,232
Why you dirty saddle stiff!
Get out of here, quick.

468
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,553
Lufton'll have to run me off.

469
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,876
I don't need orders from him
to cut down on you, Now get out!

470
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,475
What is it?

471
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,159
I'm looking for your father.

472
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,554
- Oh he's...
- Careful Miss Amy.

473
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,671
It don't matter to him where your father is.

474
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,478
It's all right, Ted.

475
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,918
That's a bad cut.
Come inside. I'll fix it.

476
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,155
Sit down.

477
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,991
Tate Riling?

478
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,788
Is he - dead?

479
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,476
No.

480
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,798
I keep remembering what you said yesterday in Sun Dust.

481
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,029
Was this a whim, too?
This business with Riling?

482
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,268
It was a pleasure.

483
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,033
What brings you back?

484
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,753
Gall, for one thing, John.

485
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,951
I got in a little jangle with Riling down at Commissary last night.
I'm through with him.

486
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,032
- Well?
- You may not believe me, Lufton

487
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,915
I want to tell you what you're up against.
Then it's up to you.

488
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,197
I already know what I'm up against.

489
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,709
You don't know that Pindalest aims to
buy your herd, do you?

490
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,875
He rejected it.

491
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,197
He won't reject it when Riling offers it to him.

492
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,396
Sure. Riling and Pindalest planned it together.

493
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,634
Pindalest's part of the deal was to order
you off the Reservation.

494
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,878
Riling was to prime the homesteaders to keep you
out of the Basin.

495
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,077
Do you figure you can round up your stuff
and cross it before the deadline?

496
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,199
- No
- And rather than let the Army take 'em you'd sell and take the loss wouldn't you?

497
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,674
Not to Riling.

498
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,515
But to a stranger like me with cash in his pockets.

499
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,596
That's the deal. I was supposed to make the offer
with Riling's money.

500
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,119
I don't believe it.

501
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,757
No, he's right, Cap.
I'd be a fool not to sell.

502
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,679
Well, I'll drift.

503
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,029
I just thought I'd let you to know.

504
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,070
Jim, wait a minute.

505
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,996
You don't tell a dead man he's dead.

506
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,316
You came here for something else, didn't you?

507
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,316
Well, I did had kind of an idea.

508
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,876
- Might not be what you'll like.
- Let's hear it.

509
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,232
Suppose the deadline was put off for a week.
That would give you time to round up your herd.

510
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,439
- Deadline hasn't been put off.
- It can be.

511
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,670
How?

512
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,355
Pindalest would laugh at me if I asked him to.

513
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,679
He wouldn't laugh at me.

514
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,995
No I'm not hiring a gunman to save my herd
or anything else.

515
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,359
Jim!

516
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,470
Jim, please wait a minute. He didn't understand what you were saying.
Please don't leave until he does.

517
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,035
He understood all right. Now step back.

518
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,955
I'm gonna follow you 'till you turn back.

519
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,033
You'll have a long ride.
I'm header for Texas.

520
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,829
All right.

521
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:33,756
We better quit this.

522
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,153
- You'll come back with me and give Dad a chance to apologize?
- No.

523
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,314
But you better go. They'll be looking for you.

524
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,355
I won't go unless you got with me.

525
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,958
Well, I'm gonna turn in.

526
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,708
I'm not leaving.

527
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,909
Well you're not staying here.

528
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,473
- Will you go back with me?
- No.

529
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,515
Then I won't go.

530
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,558
- I'll give you one more chance.
- No

531
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,120
You'll go now, unless you want more of that.

532
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,634
I don't want more of it, Jim.
But I won't go.

533
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,959
You really meant it, didn't you?

534
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,475
That much?

535
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,997
Jim, I know you better than you think.

536
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,716
You've been in hard luck
and you've made mistakes.

537
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,918
You hated those mistakes.

538
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,829
But you never admitted them
except to yourself.

539
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,631
Like this mess with Riling.
You never liked it.

540
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,432
That's why you walked out on him.

541
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,194
Today you, tried to do something
to make up for it.

542
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,910
And Dad threw it back in your face.

543
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,470
He thought you meant to kill Pindalest.

544
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,918
I didn't think so.

545
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,679
I know why you did it.

546
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,352
You thought it would help wipe out the past.

547
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,037
You're a proud man, Jim.

548
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,790
But this is the wrong kind of pride.

549
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,999
If you ride on to Texas
you're lost.

550
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,915
Cap's gone on ahead to get the drive started.

551
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,829
Only hope Riling doesn't get wind of what Garry's up to
or there'll be the devil to pay.

552
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,349
He knows what kind of man he's dealing with, Dad.

553
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,993
Yeah, I reckon he does.

554
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,998
At any rate, it's our only chance.

555
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,431
So you're going to let Dad risk everything

556
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,155
just because Garry sold you
a wild lying scheme.

557
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,632
Lie?
You don't believe what Jim told me?

558
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,957
No, Why should I?
He's nothing but a cheap gun man. A killer!

559
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,593
- That's not so. Jim wouldn't...
- Jim?

560
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,075
Yes. Jim!
What's the matter with calling him Jim?

561
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,431
He's no more a gun man than I am.

562
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,232
Amy, what is this?

563
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,319
He's trying to help us
and I'll stick up for him to you or anyone else.

564
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,988
Sounds a little stronger than sticking up for him.

565
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,674
Maybe it is.

566
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,109
But a gun man, Amy.
A man that'll go up against hired killers.

567
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,992
How did get get so expert?
You've thought of that?

568
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,473
More than you know.

569
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,433
Nothing made him come back and help us.

570
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,959
Except wanting to get even with Riling.

571
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,674
Not it's not that. He's really decent.
He...

572
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,313
Does he love you?

573
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,509
I don't know.

574
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,875
You're a fool, Amy.

575
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,113
He'll break your heart.

576
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,674
Come in. Come in.

577
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,310
Who is it?

578
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,555
Jim Garry.

579
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,113
Oh oh fine, Sit down.
I'll be out in a minute.

580
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,753
Been riding all day and was just taking a little nap.

581
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,192
- Drink?
- Don't mind if I do.

582
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,555
Well...

583
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,190
How are things?

584
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,511
Fine, Mr. Pindalest.
Just fine.

585
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,993
I brought that news you've been waiting to hear.

586
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,596
Everything went off without a hitch, huh?

587
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,271
Well, maybe one little hitch.
You might say.

588
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,291
What's that?

589
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,319
Lufton wants more money.

590
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,797
How much more?

591
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,639
Three thousand dollars.

592
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,076
Riling said his selling price to you still held.

593
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,839
This was just a loan.

594
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,993
Well, if that's all that holding us up
there's nothing to worry about, huh?

595
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,675
Success.

596
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,913
You know. This might cause a little trouble after all.

597
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,433
I don't keep that much cash here
at the agency.

598
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,715
Lufton wants cash.

599
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,316
Means I'll have to ride over to Sun Dust with you
and draw it out to the bank.

600
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,631
Riling figured you'd likely would.

601
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,714
How's the pass? Clear?

602
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,349
A little snow.
It will probably hold off.

603
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,438
Well, I'll throw some stuff together.
I'll get out of here

604
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,071
Oh I came close to forgettin'.

605
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,876
Riling says call off the Army.

606
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,478
Lufton'll likely run over the deadline
roundin' up some beef we stampeded for him.

607
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,518
Riling says he doesn't want to
explain to the Army about that.

608
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,835
Good idea.

609
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,713
I'll get a man out to Fort Liggett with a message right away.

610
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,833
Tate, what happened to you?

611
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,598
A fight. Where have you been?

612
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,119
I couldn't get out.

613
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,119
I know who you fought with,
It was Jim Garry.

614
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,269
How do you know?

615
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,393
He's been at the ranch.

616
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,319
Tate, I want to talk to you 'bout something.
That's why I came here tonight.

617
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,716
Well?

618
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:41,996
What is it?

619
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,194
Garry told us something very interesting.

620
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,111
He said that you and Pindalest had cooked up
this fight with Dad

621
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,275
to crowd him off the range so he'd sell his
cattle to you cheap.

622
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,230
Is that true?

623
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,198
So, Garry told you that, did he?

624
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,915
Is that true?

625
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,594
What else did he tell you?
This sounds good.

626
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,790
That you wanted him to make the offer to Dad.

627
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,558
Did he tell your father that?

628
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,110
Yes.

629
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,836
Tate, you haven't answeredr me. Is this true?

630
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,268
Of course.

631
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,916
You mean you've been making those poor homesteaders

632
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,395
that it's their rights you're fighting for?

633
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,079
I wanted money for us.

634
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,317
This is a way to get it, a lot of it.
Money your Dad could spare.

635
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,673
Tate, look at me.

636
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,870
Do you love me? Have you ever loved me?

637
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,834
What do you want me to say? Sure.

638
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,512
Don't lie to me.

639
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,757
You used me to beat Dad.
I betrayed him for you.

640
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,509
Now that's all you ever wanted,
It's all you ever counted on, isn't it?

641
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,869
I wouldn't say that.

642
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,713
Would you go in town with me this minute.
And marry me like you promised?

643
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,036
Not until I get money to support you.

644
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,149
What's funny?

645
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,710
I was thinking of something
I told Amy this morning.

646
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,112
Wasn't that the Lufton's girl?

647
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,754
- What's she doing here?
- None of your business.

648
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,833
What are you doing here?

649
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,151
I thought you said Garry quit

650
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,276
Well?

651
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,152
What's he doing at the Reservation?

652
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,633
- The Reservation?
- Yeah, yeah.

653
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,354
Nels saw him there this morning.
Heading for the agency.

654
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,032
Feel kind of stiff, don't you?

655
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,118
When we get to Sun Dust,
I'll sleep for a week.

656
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,590
We won't be getting to Sun Dust for
quite a while.

657
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,679
We'll just stay right here.

658
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,237
What do you mean?

659
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,028
You've been taken in, Pindalest.
Riling never sent me to see you.

660
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,880
I came to take you and
hide you out until the deadline.

661
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,792
- And Lufton did not agree to sell?
- No.

662
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,150
Also he's rounding up his cattle right now
with no Army to bother him.

663
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,759
But you're a Riling man.

664
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,511
What? I'm with Lufton now.

665
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,319
You can't get away with it, Garry.

666
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,080
Riling's no fool.
He'll be on our trail in twenty four hours.

667
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,349
Let him.

668
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,678
When he does find out what's happened,
he'll pull his men off to hunt you

669
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,190
That'll make it all easier for Lufton.

670
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,551
I'd take it easy with that If I were you Pindalest.
it will not last out the week.

671
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,269
Don't move.

672
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,072
Maybe I won't nurse this quite as long as you figured.

673
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,993
If you're plannin' on movin out,
you're going alone.

674
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,436
I'm giving you a chance to change your mind.

675
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,239
I'm staying here.

676
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,716
Now look, I can lick you and you know it.

677
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,073
Keep this up, you'll end up with a sore head, and that's all.

678
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,435
Suit yourself.

679
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,115
All right.

680
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,870
You win. Untie me.

681
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,590
Come on.

682
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,434
Come on cheer up, Pindalest.
Now we can start looking for a place to make camp.

683
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,275
- Toma! Where are you?
- Over here, Riling.

684
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,829
- Toma, Sing out!
- Riling, Over here!

685
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,829
Send the Indian to Fort Liggett.
with the message to bring the Army on.

686
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,509
- Hey, Milo.
- Yeah?

687
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,359
- Get back to the Basin.

688
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,156
See the boys hold Lufton on the Reservation
'till the troops get there.

689
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,395
What about Garry?

690
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,033
We'll take care of him.

691
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,796
Carol.

692
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,357
You've got to stop this.

693
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,308
I know.

694
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,073
I'll make some coffee.

695
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,555
I could have seen Dad and told him.

696
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,596
You must stop thinking about it.

697
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,113
Only, if we knew what was happening to him.

698
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,993
You just got to believe in what
Jim's doing would work.

699
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,753
He has a good chance.

700
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,188
Do you really think so?

701
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,719
Of course I do.

702
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,878
Why don't you lie down for a while.
I'll bring you some coffee.

703
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,789
Why Kris, I thought you'd left the Basin.

704
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,752
I did Miss Amy but...

705
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,675
I guess I've lived around here a little too long.
It got lonesome.

706
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,313
I knew you couldn't leave us for good.

707
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,909
Well I'm back to stay
and I come over to ask for your help.

708
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,839
I maybe ain't got no right asking
considering who it's for but..

709
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,316
Do you remember that young fella
you combed out over at Rocky Ford the other day?

710
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,589
He's been hurt.

711
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,835
Jim Garry?

712
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,795
Came home this morning found him lying on the floor in my shack.
He got a knife stuck in him.

713
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,353
I'll go get dressed.

714
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,239
It's me, Jim.

715
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,635
Lie still.

716
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,995
You gotta get out of here.

717
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,235
No, Jim.

718
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,435
Kris.

719
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,799
Kris, tell here to get out of here.

720
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,673
I'm going to fix this up.

721
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,675
He's asleep.

722
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,595
Good.

723
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,510
So him and your dad are in this together?

724
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,716
Yes.

725
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,189
Young lady, you're going on a ride.

726
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,269
Riling's on his trail. He'll probably
end up here sometime today.

727
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,796
That's why Garry wanted, to get you out of here.

728
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,678
We gotta get help.
Do you know where your dad is?

729
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,870
No I don't.

730
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,714
Oh Kris, I don't. We haven't heard from Dad for days.

731
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,319
Well you better find him.

732
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,137
What about Jim?

733
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,672
If they show up I can stand 'em off
till your Dad gets here. Don't let that worry you.

734
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,828
Where you gonna look for him?

735
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,433
I don't know. Somewhere south.

736
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,359
- I'll try and pick up the trail of the herd and follow it.
- Good.

737
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,389
What are you doing here?

738
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,839
I might ask you that?

739
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,909
Barden home?

740
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,097
Yes.

741
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,316
Who else is in there?

742
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,034
Nobody.

743
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,589
You're a lovely little liar.

744
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,713
All right fellas, let's take a look.

745
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,909
Hold that the door.

746
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,995
Here take this.

747
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,677
- Riling?
- Yes. And Pindalest and Shotten.

748
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,919
Look here, Kris.

749
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,995
Before this goes any further
tell Riling, I'll go with him.

750
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,155
These walls are good and thick. They can't burn us out.
And we got plenty of cartridges.

751
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,238
He won't quit till he's got me
and he'll kill you both to do it.

752
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,079
So wel let him shoot you,
just to save our necks.

753
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,909
Then tell here she's coming out.
They'll let her through

754
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,394
No. I won't go.

755
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,316
Make her go.

756
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,157
Why do you think she risked her neck to get back in here
if it wasn't on account of you?

757
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,239
Why do you think I want to get her out?

758
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,548
Same reason, I reckon.

759
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,713
He's right, Amy.

760
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,873
But it wouldn't work. Not even if you'd have me.
Now will you go?

761
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,436
No.

762
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:45,158
Look, I've been fiddlefooted and no good all my life.

763
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,153
I'm not askin' any woman to take that.

764
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,873
I knew that when I came here.

765
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,476
That's what I am, Amy. That's me.

766
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:55,593
Don't you see how useless talk is?
I'm here and I'm staying.

767
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,750
- Jim?
- Yes?

768
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,313
Jim, what are you doing up?

769
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,157
I'm going out there and try and get a crack at them.
No let me talk...

770
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,150
We can probably hold out a few more hours, but...

771
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,396
You ain't going out there just to save our necks.

772
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,877
I'll try and save my own too.

773
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,472
We might as well face it.
They're not gonna give up.

774
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,278
It's not likely anybody'll be along to help us.

775
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,993
Then I'll go.

776
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,400
I got a score to settle with Riling myself.

777
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,512
No, Kris.
It's me Riling's after.

778
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,236
I'd like to finish this my own way.

779
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,636
- You will let him go Miss Amy?
- Yes she is.

780
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,719
Where are they exactly?

781
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,114
They're all scattered out.

782
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,198
Riling's over on the left of 'em trees.
The other two are closer to the corral.

783
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,516
If I just make it to the corner of the corral
I can circle around and get behind them

784
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,393
But they'll see you.

785
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,588
Soon as I get out
you open up on 'em.

786
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,879
That'll draw a return fire. Their powder flash will
blind 'em for a couple of seconds, thats all I need.

787
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,875
- Ready?

788
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,715
Hold it, Miss Amy. Hold it!
I think he made it.

789
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,758
That last shot came from another direction.

790
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,110
- Do you want to get hit?
- But I got to know.

791
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:04,356
Hey, Shotten?

792
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,070
Pindalest?

793
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,190
All right Riling, It's just you and me now.

794
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,358
It's a pleasure, Jim.

795
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,354
For me, Tate.

796
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,593
Same old Jim.

797
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,911
When lightning strikes, you're there.

798
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,508
You and me together, Jim.
We coulda licked 'em

799
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:55,990
But you,

800
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:02,114
you always had a conscience
breathing down your neck.

801
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:21,950
Jim!

802
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,679
Riling's dead.

803
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,310
Shotten too.

804
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,794
And Pindalest?

805
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,637
No I do not think so. He's over there.

806
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,754
- Dad. - Carol told me you were here.
She was afraid there might be trouble.

807
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,436
- Where's riling?
- He's dead.

808
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:54,789
Well Lufton, don't look like you're gonna
get Riling to do much talking now.

809
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,190
I'm going to have you arrested for murder.

810
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,222
Put up a fair fight, John. And
I'll tell that to the sheriff.

811
01:26:01,223 --> 01:26:02,997
Or anybody else that wants to know.

812
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,191
Lufton was telling us about a little deal

813
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,472
that you and Riling cooked
up to swindle him out of his cattle.

814
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,629
- What about it?
- I had no deal with Riling.

815
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,991
Don't forget I was in on it too.

816
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,555
Well boys, that's the man
you've been fighting for.

817
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,158
Get your horse. Me and you are going to
have a little talk with the marshal.

818
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,798
I guess we been a pack of fools, Lufton.

819
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:34,592
Say fellas. I've got a jug I been saving
for a special occasion. This looks like it.

820
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,949
What do you say if we...?

821
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,319
Garry I guess I was wrong about
quite a few things.

822
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,836
Yeah I was wrong about a few things myself.

823
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,315
We've been plenty stubborn.

824
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,954
That's going to make two stubborn
men in the family.

825
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:56,115
Well I guess Kris was right.
This is a special occasion.

826
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,555
Come on.
