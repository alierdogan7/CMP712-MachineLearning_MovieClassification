I don't know nothing
about warfare as such.

182
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,713
You created this mess,

183
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:02,008
and you'll clean it up or die trying.

184
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,177
I'll not do it.

185
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,388
Aah! Jesus!

186
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:12,226
Now, all of you that was
involved in this hanging

187
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:17,600
will accompany Mr. Toole
on his noble quest.

188
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:21,471
How the hell do you expect these
Bogtrotters to track down Bohannon?

189
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:23,673
Well, that's their problem.

190
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:27,310
Ah, let me and Dix take 'em.

191
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,579
Hmm?

192
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:33,039
I'll track him down like a rabid dog.

193
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,885
Cullen: Hold. Slow up,
slow up. Slow up.

194
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,600
Why we stopping here?

195
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,643
Good a place as any.

196
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,117
Bohannon...

197
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,086
What you did for me
back at that saloon...

198
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:11,452
What the hell was you thinkin'?

199
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,120
You carrying on with a white woman?

200
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:15,331
I'm a free man.
You ain't that free.

201
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,061
Why you get to decide that?

202
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:19,697
I ain't decide nothing.

203
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:22,757
That's the way of the world.

204
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:40,940
What's it like to own
somebody, Mr. Cullen?

205
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:47,549
Any different than owning
a dog or a pig or a plow?

206
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,096
I treated my people well,

207
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:53,288
if that's what you're asking.

208
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,400
Your people?

209
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:59,403
You make it sound like
they was family to you.

210
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:03,507
Well, one of them practically
raised me after my mother died.

211
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:07,912
Yeah, but...
You be owning her.

212
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:09,681
Even if she changed
your dirty drawers,

213
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,707
you still be owning her.

214
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:21,564
I wouldn't mind owning me
a white woman.

215
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,776
Yes, sir.
That might be nice.

216
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,631
Maybe I'd bring her in
from the fields

217
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:30,301
of an evening and have me some fun.

218
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:32,561
[Chuckles]
Watch yourself.

219
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,801
And what if she give me a baby boy?

220
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,707
Would I own that, too?

221
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,778
Or would half of him be free?

222
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:54,462
And what if I bring that boy
into my house from time to time?

223
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:57,221
And teach him to read and write?

224
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:02,470
And I give that boy
just enough hope...

225
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:06,607
To think that maybe...
Just maybe he different.

226
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,767
Different than all
the other white folk I owned?

227
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,911
Nah.

228
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,415
He ain't no different.

229
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:27,963
He just a mule.

230
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,624
Everybody know a mule ain't no horse.

231
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,861
Ain't that right, Mr. Cullen?

232
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,034

00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:15,446
Damn it all.

237
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:18,374
Damn it all.

[Footsteps]

239
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:23,185
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:27,316
No! Ma'am, please, stay.

241
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,991
You weren't at dinner.

242
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:40,640
I... supped on Brandy.

243
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:42,747
Five course meal.

244
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,054
Do you know what this is?

245
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,514
[Sighs]
It's a penny.

246
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,095
I wish it were just a penny...

247
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,437
Rather than the seed
of my own destruction.

248
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,981
I don't understand.

249
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:17,065
I was raised in a shanty
town in hell's kitchen.

250
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:22,147
Only difference between
us and the rats

251
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:25,618
were the rats were
better fed and cleaner.

252
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:26,999
Sorry to hear that.

253
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:30,753
I don't want your sympathy.

254
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:37,563
One day, while I was rummaging
through the trash for a meal...

255
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:41,733
Some gentlemen passed me by.

256
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:45,403
One of them told me
he would give me a penny

257
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:48,239
if I ate a putrid apple

258
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:52,411
that even the rats had passed over.

259
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:58,405
I... will never forget that taste.

260
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:03,327
It was all I could do
to keep it down.

261
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:09,195
Ohh. They had a good laugh, and...

262
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,794
One of them tossed me the coin.

263
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,005
And on that day, my bark
was set on a course

264
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,721
that neither tempest nor
leviathan could alter.

265
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:26,281
I would have it all...

266
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:32,106
And I would have it on my terms.

267
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:34,079
[Sighs]

268
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,611
I know no other way, Lily.

269
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:41,031
I faced ruin many times...

270
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,964
And I always found a way out.

271
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,299
But...

272
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:50,428
This time... I fear I may not recover.

273
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:58,511
Is this Thomas Durant...

274
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:01,594
Or some blubbering schoolboy
I see before me?

275
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,221
I gave you those maps

276
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:09,122
so you could finish the railroad...
For Robert's sake.

277
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,729
I won't let you quit.

278
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,282
Get your head out of that bottle
and figure out a way.

[Crickets]

281
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:56,093
I gave my slaves their freedom
before the war started.

282
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:01,608
Damn near went broke
paying their wages.

283
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,768
I'm supposed to thank you for that?

284
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,605
No.

285
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:12,609
I only did it for my wife.

286
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:17,690
I sure as hell didn't understand it.

287
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,992
[Sighs]

288
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:23,562
It pissed me off, tell you the truth.

289
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:26,831
So why'd you do it, then?

290
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,724
Well...

291
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,605
Mary had a way of
talking me into things.

292
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,564
Hmm.

293
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:44,481
It wasn't until
I come home from the war...

294
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:48,819
Right then, actually...

295
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:52,981
That I understood that she was right.

296
00:22:57,654 --> 00:23:01,000
I found Mary where she was hanged,
you know.

297
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:06,063
But... I couldn't find my boy.

298
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,412
We'd always play hide and go seek,

299
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:16,815
and he'd always hide
up in the hayloft.

300
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,243
Every damned time... every time...

301
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:27,783
He'd... and I'd just...
I'd pretend like I couldn't find him.

302
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,690
See, the Yankees, they...

303
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,436
They burned the barn,
but it was still standing.

304
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:38,062
And...

305
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,467
There he was...

306
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:49,074
Up in the hayloft.

307
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:54,923
His body was curled up,
and his arms was...

308
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:58,979
Hugging his knees to his chest.

309
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:01,796
But he wasn't alone.

310
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:05,800
Bethel... the woman who raised me...

311
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:08,303
She was with him.

312
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:11,197
She had her arms
wrapped around him...

313
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,767
Like she was protecting
him from the flame.

314
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:27,279
Both their bodies, they were...
Scorched black...

315
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:32,193
Fused together, you know?

316
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:36,387
Couldn't really tell where one of
them ended and the other one began.

317
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:42,068
And I just remember standing there

318
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:44,561
and thinking to myself...

319
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:51,444
God's got a funny way
of teaching you things.

320
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:53,403
Huh?

321
00:25:00,412 --> 00:25:01,542
Yeah.

the plantation all the time.

You try.

328
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,427
You got to cock it.

Damn.

332
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,654
And you're ready.

333
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,823
What do you mean, I'm ready?
I can't even hit the dang tree.

334
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:17,284
Well, you're just going to
have to get in close, then.

335
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,329
How am I going to get up
close without getting shot?

336
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:24,102
Whoever you're shooting at is going
to be just as scared as you are.

337
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:27,606
You take your time.
Don't lose your head.

338
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:28,962
Count your rounds as you fire.

339
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:33,044
If you're calm, you'll
count their rounds, too.

340
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,386
The trick is making sure the other
man has to reload before you do.

341
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:37,804
And if I don't?

342
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,267
You're dead.
End of lesson.

Good morning, Thomas.

a way out of my mess.

Now, this is a map of
all the other railroads...

An intricate web of iron
connecting all the eastern cities.

350
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:14,883
But something is missing.

351
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:16,593
Can you see it?

352
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:20,806
There is no direct route connecting

353
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,433
the Union Pacific to New York... yet.

354
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,768
Well done.

355
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,395
Why not?

356
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,569
Well, I have two choices.

357
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:30,737
I can build a beltline to the R&R

358
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:34,069

I'm not so sure.
Can't you stay a while?

have me by the short hairs.

back and watch it happen.

538
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:42,317
23rd psalm.

539
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:53,537
"The Lord is my Shepherd.

540
00:41:53,662 --> 00:41:56,039
"I shall not want.

541
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:59,267
"He maketh me to lie down
in the green pastures.

542
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,547
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

543
00:42:02,672 --> 00:42:04,783
Both:
"He restoreth my soul.

544
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:10,890
"He leadeth me in paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

545
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:13,990
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

546
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,728
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

547
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:20,621
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

548
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:24,267
"Surely, goodness
and mercy shall follow me

549
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:26,569
"all the days of my life,

550
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:30,797
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever."
