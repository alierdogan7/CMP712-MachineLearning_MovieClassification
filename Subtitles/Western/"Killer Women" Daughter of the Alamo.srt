Damn it, Billy, you're looking at
20 years in federal prison right now.

4
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:10,991
Molly, listen. I need to take off.

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:12,259
You mean from me.

6
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:13,493
You dumped her?

7
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:14,762
Look, she can't know about this.

8
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,130
And I don't lie to the people I love.

00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:18,031
From the D.E.A.'s point
of view, he's an asset...

10
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:19,733
could help us get closer to
the higher-ups in the cartel.

Nestor: Are you working for the government?

12

would be in here already.

You tell your prosecutor I'm done.

It doesn't work that way.

16
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,577
It does now.

17
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:31,811
Sign the divorce papers,

18

truth, the whole truth,

please tell the court

27
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:57,169
why you're here today?

28
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:00,038
I want to change the grounds
of my petition for divorce.

29
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:02,308
What would you wish to change them to?

Cruelty.

Physical cruelty.

During our marriage,

33
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:15,120
my husband, Jake Colton,
punched me repeatedly.

34
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:20,598
And on one occasion, he tried
to kill me by strangling.

35
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:24,736
Ranger Parker, are you prepared

36
00:01:24,804 --> 00:01:26,571
to describe to us details
of these incidents?

37
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:29,106
Yes.

38
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:32,009
I am.

39
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:34,345
Senator Colton, what do you have to say

40
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:36,614
about these allegations from your wife?

41
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:41,352
I'd say I'm disappointed
[Sighs] and heartbroken.

42

My wife has decided to sling mud, falsely.

43
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,192
Why would she make such
allegations if they weren't true?

44
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,794
Because she's not getting
the divorce she wants

45
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,361
when she wants it.

46
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:53,563
Think about it. We... we've
been separated for a year.

47
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,866
Don't you find it odd that
she mentions these charges

48
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:57,168
for the very first time

49
00:01:57,235 --> 00:01:59,336
just days before I launch
my re-election campaign?

50
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:01,938
It's about hurting me. That's all.

51
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,308
I would love five minutes
alone with that man.

52
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,343
I would take every part
of him and make it hurt.

53
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:08,312
I don't need my sister-in-law
arrested for murder,

54
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,413
thank you very much.

55
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,647

Why don't you take the
day off and go for a ride?

It's his third marriage,

75
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:59,794
and he swears this one's gonna
last till death do them part.

76
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,030
He's demanding a preacher be
sent out to renew their vows.

00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:55,618
Falling out among thieves... classic.

715
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:57,020
So who killed Mims?

716
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:58,921
It's pretty clear the boy kept bad company.

717
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:01,557
Maybe another falling out among thieves?

718
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:03,126
No doubt.

719
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:05,194
You know, I think you're right.

720
00:32:05,262 --> 00:32:07,496
I figured she'd come around.

721
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:12,333
- What was that?
- Exactly.

[Printer whirs]

723
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:26,503
You want to tell me what we're doing?

724
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:28,215
Just pay attention.

726
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:34,148

I'm Bradley Tucker. How can I help you?

728
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:38,085
We just need to talk to your wife, sir.

729
00:32:38,153 --> 00:32:41,055
Oh. Hey, there, Rangers. Did you, uh...

730
00:32:41,122 --> 00:32:42,722
did you catch a break on the case?

731
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,925
Actually, we lost our best suspect.

732
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:46,626
Somebody killed Mims Shackleford.

733
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:49,930
Oh, my lord. That... that's horrible.

734
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:52,332
Yeah. We think it's the same
person who killed Tara Sills.

735
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,267
[Baby coos] You mean... you
mean after all this time,

736
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:57,003
you still think that he's around?

737
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:58,438
I think so.

738
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:00,507
Do you recognize this man?

739
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:05,578
He's the one? I mean, you...
you think that he did it?

740
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:06,579
Have you seen him?

741
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:08,114
Uh...

742
00:33:08,182 --> 00:33:10,950
I'm... I'm not sure.

743
00:33:11,018 --> 00:33:12,285
You're not sure?

744
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:14,487
No, I ju... I just...
I can't say that I am.

745
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,422
Well, that is certainly unusual

746
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,524
because that was your father.

747
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,793
[Laughs] Sorry?

748
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,160
Well, it was Sue Ellen's father,

749
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:24,162
but you've never seen him
before, have you, Tara?

750
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,931
- What?
- Tara?

751
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,299
Oh, Bradley, just pay no mind.

752
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,869

[Chuckles]

754
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:34,373
She's Tara Sills?

755
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,773
Molly: Yep.

756
00:33:35,841 --> 00:33:37,942
She met Sue Ellen on a bus to Texas

757
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,978
and saw a way out of
her own messed-up life.

758
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:41,446
All she had to do was kill Sue Ellen

759
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:44,449
and take over her life,
college scholarship and all,

760

761
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:48,220
I got your prints off that
picnic flyer you gave me.

762
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:51,022
They match Tara Sills.

763
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:52,724
Well, I'll be damned.

764
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:55,192
Your ex-boyfriend Mims helped
you get rid of the body,

765
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,694
and then you paid him to go away.

766
00:33:56,762 --> 00:33:58,963
And when we got onto him,

767
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:01,365
you had to make sure he couldn't talk.

768
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,535
I... I want you away from my family now.

769
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:05,102
Oh, we're going.

770
00:34:06,238 --> 00:34:09,907
Tara Sills, you're under arrest.

that baby to your husband?

My baby?

774
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:20,851
But... I'm a good mother,
and I'm a good wife.

775
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,121
And I just... I've been living a good life,

776
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,624
the perfect life.

777
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,927
Killing Mims yesterday
kind of marred that record.

778
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:31,562

00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,165

How did you know?

785
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,622
The body was dumped

786
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,724
in a place that would
make it unrecognizable,

787
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:04,560
so no one could I.D. it except
the new friend Sue Ellen.

788
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:06,228
When we had Mims on the ropes,

789
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:09,565
a lawyer Mims clearly wasn't
expecting bailed him out.

790

Sills didn't want Mims talking.

And who was around from
back then but Sue Ellen,

792
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:18,039
the girl with no parents who came to Texas

793
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:20,309
to start a new life?

794
00:35:20,376 --> 00:35:23,778
The only question was who she really was.

795
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:25,981
I just needed to check her prints.

No. I don't.

798
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,255
I had that case inside out from day one.

799
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:35,590
Yeah, well, then you helped solve it.

falling out, which it was.

How come you never mentioned

827
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,227
this so-called cruelty back then?

828
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:49,361
Fear.

829
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:51,831
Oh, come on. A Texas Ranger afraid of me?

830
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:54,766
Not afraid of you. Afraid of embarrassment.

831
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,001
Oh.

832
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:57,336
As an officer of the law,

833
00:36:57,404 --> 00:36:59,771
you're familiar with police reports?

834
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:00,972
Yes.

835
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,441
I mean, when someone
is a victim of a crime,

836
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:04,310
- they report it, right?
- Generally.

837
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:06,845
So now you're saying that you're a victim.

838
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:09,915
So, can we get a look at
these reports that you filed?

839
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,116
I never did.

840
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:12,450
Oh.

841
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:15,386
Well, maybe you got some
friends you confided in

842
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:16,888
that can tell us what you said

843
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:19,057
about these so-called
incidents back at the time.

844
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:22,928
I never told anyone.

845
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:25,896
Any photos of your injuries?

846
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:27,265
No.

847
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:33,504
So... no proof, no records,

848
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:36,774

00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:38,243
As a law officer,

850
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:41,379
would you arrest somebody based on that?

851
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:43,781
I'd evaluate the
credibility of the witnesses.

852
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:46,683
You are a public figure

853
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:48,953
with every reason to conceal what you did.

854
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,122
I have nothing to gain by coming forth

855
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:54,959
except public humiliation
and my freedom from you.

856
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,062
You can't hide from the truth.

857
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,031
And, Your Honor, I am telling the truth.

858
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,968
Judge... there's nothing here.

859
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:08,104
Judge Garrity: Well, it
seems like he said/she said.

860
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:11,941
So, in the absence of
any actual evidence...

861
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:15,544
Mr. Orba, have you lost
interest in these proceedings?

862
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:16,746
No, Your Honor.

863
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,447
We may be able to break this impasse

864
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:20,283
by calling on two additional witnesses...

865
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,118
Ms. Diane Simmons and Maria de La Vega.

866
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:23,953
Mr. Franks: Can't see what good it'll do.

867
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:26,189
Ms. Parker just conceded
there are no witnesses.

868
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:27,723
Well, she wasn't aware of these.

869
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:28,825
But I can assure the court

870
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:30,393
that they can shed light on this case.

871
00:38:31,795 --> 00:38:33,462
Very well.

872
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,265

- That won't be necessary.

any further embarrassments,

874
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:43,406
I'm withdrawing my objection
to her divorce petition.

875
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:48,977
I'm willing to sign the
final documents right now.

876
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,291

878
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:08,396
He's an abuser.

879
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:10,665
If he hit you, he hit other women, too.

880
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:12,133
I did some digging.

881
00:39:12,201 --> 00:39:15,102
Found a couple of old
girlfriends he batted around.

882
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,671
And they're willing to testify?

883
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:18,673
I don't know. Never talked to them.

884
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:20,809
Jake doesn't know that.

885
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:22,676
Yeah, but he doesn't stay in touch.
