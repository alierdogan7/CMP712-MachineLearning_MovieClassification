184
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,273
She was comin' at me
like a wildcat.

185
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,009
I was just
protectin' myself!

186
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,011
Doc says

187
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,146
She may not regain sight
in her left eye.

188
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,749
That's your wife
we're talking about.

189
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,451
Tie him up, trampas.

190
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,056
[Avery]: Please, judge!
I didn't mean to hurt her!

191
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,093
For gosh sakes!

192
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,762
- Shut up!
- [Blow lands]

193
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,297
My rawhide, Danny.

194
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,500
[***]

195
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,337
I know you heard me, son.

196
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,875
[Avery]: Please, judge!

197
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,078
I swear to God,
I won't do it again!

198
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:30,450
It's just to remind you
how we treat our women

199
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,785
In this town.

200
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,454
[Crying out] Ah!

201
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,491
[Avery screaming]

202
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:39,359
Ah!

203
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,495
[Whip cracks, Avery screams]

204
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,964
Ahh!

205
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,335
Oh! Please!

206
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,104
[Whip cracks,
Avery cries out]

207
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,507
Let him down.

208
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,249
[Breathing raggedly]

209
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,887
[Thuds]

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,089
Next time you think about
beating up on a woman,

211
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,824
You just remember how that felt.

212
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,960
[Weakly]: Yes, sir.

213
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,194
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

214
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,363
[Avery wheezing]

215
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,570
It's a pleasure
to see you again, judge Henry.

216
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,306
Sorry you had to witness that.

217
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,841
But, uh...

218
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,977
Sometimes, that's the only way
to get through.

219
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,012
Anyway...

220
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,947
Glad you made it
out of the city

221
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,850
And found your way back into
God's country, huh?

222
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:37,951
That I did.

223
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,320
Long time no see, cowboy.

224
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,123
What's he doin' here?

225
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,591
He's gonna solve
the rustling problem.

226
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,026
That's my job.

227
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,128
Yep. It was.

228
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,363
You're gonna rehire him
after what he did?

229
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,398
Everybody makes mistakes.

230
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,001
[Takes a heavy breath]

231
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,635
He's made his amends.
Right, trampas?

232
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,106
He knew Porter
was riding that night.

233
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,009
Since when do rustlers
ride alone, anyway?

234
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,977
You calling me
a murderer?

235
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,478
Saying it's hard
to keep your eyes on your work

236
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,514
When you're having to watch
behind you all the time.

237
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,116
I ain't working with him!

238
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,951
I'm sure I don't
have to remind you,

239
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,552
Your allegiance
is to sunk creek.

240
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,055
We clear here?

241
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,293
Yes, sir.

242
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,129
Perfectly.

243
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,297
Besides...

244
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,167
I'm planning on bringing
you in as my heir.

245
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,170
I want you
to concentrate some more

246
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,172
On the business
side of things.

247
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,474
Your heir?

248
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,575
[***]

249
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,510
Now, if you're willing
to earn it,

250
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,179
I can give you a roof
over your head,

251
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,681
Food, a fair wage.

252
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,616
And more important,

253
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,354
I can teach you
about honor and justice...

254
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,223
And how to live
by a code.

255
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,962
I don't know what to say.

256
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,363
Well, just say,

257
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,399
"I'm looking forward
as much as you are, judge."

258
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,371
Good to have you back, son.

259
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,007
Have yourself a good time.

260
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,081
Danny...

261
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,649
You still stealin' biscuits
from the cookshack?

262
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,551
Only when the cook
ain't lookin'.

263
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:22,089
Steal some extra ones tonight,
'cause I'm riding with you.

264
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,991
Yes, sir, South.

265
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,493
You're gonna go up
to high lonesome.

266
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,633
Have any rustlers
been spotted along here?

267
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,736
Nah. Mostly over
on the valley side,

268
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,305
Over by sunk creek.

269
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,507
How come
I can't ride over there?

270
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,409
You still need to
keep your eyes open

271
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,643
And be mindful.

272
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,346
There been well over
3,000 head stolen

273
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,982
In natrona county
in the last year or so,

274
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:49,983
At 20 bucks a head.

275
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,552
Dang! That's more money
than I ever dreamed of.

276
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,187
Whoa.

277
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,255
Don't worry.

278
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,090
If they try me,
I'll give 'em hell.

279
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,758
You listen to me, Danny.

280
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,694
Rustlers are ruthless
as a general rule.

281
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,231
They'll cut you down
without a thought.

282
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,566
All in the name of thievin'
what don't belong to them,

283
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,002
Thievin'
our way of life.

284
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:12,005
I'll be ready,
I promise.

285
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,607
[***]

286
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,419
When I said
to be ready to go at sun-up,

287
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,189
I didn't mean
halfway through the mornin'.

288
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,563
It's barely 7:00.

289
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,632
Yeah, and the sun
came up at 5:45.

290
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,604
It's past time for us
to be gettin' a move on.

291
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,040
Well, good morning to you, too.

292
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,508
Try to keep up.

293
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,777
You don't like me
much, do you?

294
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,580
I don't know you yet.

295
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,515
If I tell you
somethin',

296
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,484
You promise to keep
your mouth shut?

297
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,751
I'm game.

298
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,054
I think it's about time
for me to move on.

299
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,456
What, because of
that trampas gentleman?

300
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,293
Trampas is about
as far from a gentleman

301
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,361
As a man can be.

302
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,630
I don't know what
the judge was thinking

303
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,500
When he brought
that scum on.

304
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,238
Hyah!

305
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,395
[Sighs heavily]

306
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,667
[***]

307
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,408
Danny...

308
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,613
Ed had his daddy's
old gun pointed at Clyde,

309
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,382
He made him strip,
bare-assed,

310
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,251
Right in front of
all the girls.

311
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,253
He ran squawking
like a rooster.

312
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,188
What'd
all the girls do?

313
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,322
They ran, too.

314
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,124
Just in the opposite
direction.

315
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,359
[Both laugh]

316
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:15,662
God, I raised you
with some sense, boy.

317
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,300
[***]

318
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,437
Why don't you
hang back a bit?

319
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,441
[***]

320
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,820
Son, no matter what,

321
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,854
You promise me

322
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,556
You're not gonna go down
in that valley, you hear?

323
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,457
Matter of fact,
you get yourself home.

324
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,458
Why? What's going on?

325
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,426
You listen to your pa!

326
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,560
But I can help!

327
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,462
Get home! Hyah!

328
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,299
[***]

329
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,441
[***]

330
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,211
[Shot echoes]

331
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,847
No! Pa!

332
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,349
No!

333
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,618
[***]

334
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,660
Danny...

335
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,511
[Sighing]

336
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,689
What the hell happened?

337
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,259
Rustlers. Shot Danny.

338
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,901
Where was he at?

339
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,803
High lonesome.

340
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:07,240
High lonesome?

341
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,576
I thought
he was working sunk creek?

342
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,378
Already had a couple men
over at sunk creek.

343
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,545
I figured he'd be safe...

344
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,580
You figured?

345
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:14,847
You figured?

346
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,949
I thought I was doing right.

347
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,827
I promised his mom
I'd take care of him.

348
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,598
Gather up his things.

349
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,566
I gotta...
I gotta go tell her.

350
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,644
I never should've sent him
out there alone.

351
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:48,781
He knew this was a risky way
to make a living.

352
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,751
I just never caused
an innocent man to die before.

353
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,455
You want to quit?

354
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,560
No, sir.

355
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:05,432
I intend to serve justice
on those who done this to Danny.

356
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,900
But you're gonna have to
work with trampas.

357
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:15,708
He works for me.

358
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,881
Fair enough.

359
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,318
Oh, one more thing.

360
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:28,555
I'd like to move in
to Porter's old bunkhouse.

361
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,357
Give me a little more room
to think.

362
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,959
Well, you don't know when
to stop pushin', do you?

363
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:36,396
No, sir, I don't reckon I do.

364
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,504
Ahh.

365
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,676
[Crickets chirping]

366
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:07,960
[Sighs]

367
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,498
Porter...

368
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,701
Why'd trampas
have it out for you?

369
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,109
Ho!

370
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,001
What the hell is that?

371
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,811
Alright, Owen.

372
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,713
You wanna
learn to cowboy,

373
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,082
You need to learn
to use this.

374
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,085
Alright.

375
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,688
Now just pull
the hammer back,

376
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,724
Line the sights up
on the bottle...

377
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,893
And pull
the trigger easy.

378
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:26,906
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

379
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:30,209
It is legal to own a gun
east of the Mississippi.

380
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,446
The hell, you say.

381
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,148
[Owen chuckling]

382
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,485
[***]

383
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,050
Damn.

384
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,152
You did not
like the ending?

385
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,988
Ah, it ain't a book.

386
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,891
It's some kind
of ledger.

387
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,227
Why's it finding you
so frustrated?

388
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,596
Well, you tell me.

389
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,665
It's just
a bunch of nonsense.

390
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,102
It's a cipher.

391
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,237
A what?

392
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,572
A word puzzle

393
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:33,773
Where you substitute
one letter for another

394
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,675
And then you try
to decipher it.

395
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,110
Porter,
the last foreman,

396
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,180
Had it squirreled away
in his foot locker,

397
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,683
Like he didn't want
nobody to find it.

398
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:44,884
Do you mind if
I have a look at it?

399
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,919
I've always
enjoyed puzzles.

400
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,121
Maybe I can
come up with something.

401
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,559
Ah, let me take
another crack at it.

402
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,199
So would you say

403
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,235
You're the fastest with a gun
around here?

404
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,137
[Takes a breath]

405
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,673
Well...

406
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,608
Guess that depends on
how you define fast.

407
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,009
Meaning?

408
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:14,747
Well, any fool can
draw a gun quick and shoot it.

409
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,149
Might even hit somethin'.

410
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,086
Likely won't be what he was
intending on hitting, though.

411
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:25,091
No, sir, I don't think
it's so much a matter of speed

412
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,994
As it is a matter of will.

413
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,097
It seems to me
there are plenty of men

414
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,231
In this part
of the world

415
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,933
That seem to possess
that will.

416
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:37,103
Well, no question
about that, but...

417
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:40,573
When it comes right down
to the nut crackin',

418
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,975
And it's either
you or him,

419
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,878
You got to be able
to look a man in his eyes

420
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:49,882
And have the will
to end his life...

421
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,185
And you got to know
that you're gonna do it

422
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,353
Without hesitating.

423
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,256
And you do not hesitate?

424
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,327
I guess I ain't yet.

425
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,833
Does it ever bother you?

426
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:09,035
The men
that you've killed?

427
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,874
Rustling is like
stealing our way of life.

around these parts

Revolves around cattle

Since the silver
ran out.

431
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,949
Rustlers, they're...

432
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,283
A poison.

433

A poison
to our way of life.

434
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:32,058
You didn't answer
my question.

435
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah, I did.

436
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,997
It's all about
"the code" out here.

437
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,165
It's all we have.

00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,769
You sign on,
you ride for the brand.

439
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,106
What does that mean?

440
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:51,277
Well, it means that
a man's word is his bond

441
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,047
And you can choose to...

442
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,649
Live by that rule,

443
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:59,118
Or you can die.

444
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:07,794
Well, we're picking up
that schoolteacher tomorrow.

445
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:12,064

Ah, most women out here

449
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:21,373
Are either whores
or housewives.

450
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,376
That makes 'em
either too crazy

451
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,378
Or not crazy enough.

452
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,717
Unique perspective.

Yes.

You're the gentleman
that wrote me that sweet letter.

Well, I'm just trying
to do my part.

459
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,009
It was very compelling.

460
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,711
Really?

461
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:00,246
Indeed.
It convinced me

462
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,015
Of the dire need
to accept the position.

463
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,053

00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,788
Pleasure.

465
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:09,822
Nice to meet you.

466
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,290
Them your bags?

They are.

468
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,860
If you would be so kind
as to take my trunk,

469
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:14,994
I can get the rest of the bags.

470
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,864
Ma'am, a gentleman doesn't let a
lady carry her own bags.

471
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:19,899
I can manage. Shall we?

472
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:22,735
Let's.

Here it is.

After you, ma'am.

477
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:56,002
I, um, know
it's not fancy,

478
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,971
But we tried to
clean it up for you.

479
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:01,774
It's perfectly fine.
Thank you.

480
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:02,909
I'm sure you've stayed

481
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,978
In some swanky places
back east.

482
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:08,014
One or two.

483
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,849
But you know what
I learned?

484
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,451
That you shouldn't
have left?

485
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,021
[Laughs] No.

486
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:17,957
I learned that my head
only needs one pillow.

487
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:23,462
Well, uh, you should've
seen it before, though.

488

got in here, and...

489
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,501
Anyway.

490
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,536
Um...

00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,940
You just holler.

493
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,108
Sure.

494
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,376
Good afternoon, then.

like you wanted.

[Distracted]:
Hmm? What'd you say?

500
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,301
Said we got
the herd moved

501
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:05,071
To the West Side of the creek,
without any trouble.

502
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,873
Fine. Fine.

503
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,875
Good work, South.

504
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,843
What you got there?

505
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:14,146
Found that
in Porter's bunkhouse.

506
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:26,592
I can't make heads or tails
out of this nonsense.

507
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,295
Mr. walton figures
it's some kind of cipher,

508
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,197
Like a puzzle.

509
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,532
Hmm.

510
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,335
Did you figure it out yet?

511
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,004
No, but I got a fool notion

512
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:40,006
It's got somethin' to do
with the rustling.

513
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,141
Well, you don't think Porter had
anything to do with this?

514
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,010
That man
was salt of the earth.

515
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,377
No.

516
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:49,481
Besides, the rustlin'
didn't stop after he was killed.

517
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,952
Tell you one thing,
we don't resolve this soon,

518
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,353
I'm gonna have to start

519
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:57,189
Throwing off some of
the dead weight around here.

520
00:30:57,223 --> 00:31:00,259
Well, I hope
trampas is included.

521
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,928
You know...

522
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,163
You can say what you want to
about trampas,

523
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,564
But he always manages
to get his job done.

524
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,467
That's more than I can say
for your drunken friend.

525
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,536
I went through four years
of hell with Steve

526
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,671
And I know
what kind of man he is.

527
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,607
You can count on him
just like you can count on me.

528
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,643
Well, even you left me
one time.

529
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:18,911
You know
I just did that

530
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,312
'Cause of my kin
back in Virginia.

531
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:24,416
I lost a lot more
in that damn war than you did.

532
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,451
Point I'm trying
to make is,

533
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,053
I'm running
a business here, South.

534
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,322
I'm not running a flophouse
for drunken cowboys.

535
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:32,959
I want you to pay
special attention

536
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,560
To them weasels
like balin.

537
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,095
Them small ranchers,

538
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,364
Think they're entitled
to what they don't own.

539
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,401
I'll go pay him a visit.

540
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,203
Thank you.

541
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,072
Now, if
you don't mind,

542
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,407

You take that back.

What?

727
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,875
You stand up
and tell these boys

728
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,844
That you ain't
nothing but a liar.

729

Aw, take it easy, cowboy.

We all know
you're sweet on her.

731
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:34,119
You know, some fellas
tried to kill me yesterday.

A bunch of old blue-bellies,
just like you.

733
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:39,357
I ain't been in that damn army
for years now,

734
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,892
So don't look at me.

Well, the way I look at it,

736
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,996
You're the only sumbitch
around here that has a grudge.

00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,699
And you move your hand
one inch closer to that pistol,

738
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,868
You gonna be in a pine box
come morning.

She ain't your woman.

00:43:03,148 --> 00:43:04,883
You might
want her to be...

744
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,052
But she ain't.

745
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,288
I can say whatever I please.

746
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,757
No, you can't...

747
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,892

I say
you are finished drinkin'.

How bad
you want it to be?

758
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:43,188
Bad enough
to die for it?

759
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:47,058
I figure that's about
as good a reason as any.

760
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,260
Besides...

761
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,796

not to call me that no more.

Get rid of him.

if he's Jesus Christ!

I can't afford
to have him around.

After what he did?

887
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,442
Trampas told us
about the ambush

888

escaped with his life.

I found you still alive.

Trampas had run for it by then.

894

It took a few days
to find the other Indian,

But when he was caught,
justice was swift.

when I was shot.

don't kill him.

905
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,671
South!

906
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,746
I got business with
that son of a bitch.

907
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,150
He shot me in the back
and left me for dead.

908
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:01,886
Ah, it was the Indians
that done that.

909
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,422
Hell, I barely got outta there
with my own life.

910
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,157
I know it was you

911
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:08,259
Sent them yankee soldiers
to bushwhack me, too.

912
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:09,294
The hell're you talking about?

913
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:11,696
Alright,
let's end this right now.

914
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:13,398
That's what I came over here
to do, trampas.

915
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,433
There ain't gonna be
no gunplay.

916
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,702

[Barks]:
Stand down!

918
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,443
What the hell
is he talking about?

919
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,545
Two innocent injuns dead
'cause of him.

920
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:29,647
Ain't no such thing
as an innocent injun.

921
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,949
Trampas, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

922
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,618
What's he talkin' about?

923
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,821
Sir, you know how a man's brain
gets after he's been shot.

924
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,424
Ahh, I remember it
clear as a bell, judge!

925
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:43,861
South, I've always known you
to be a man of your word.

926
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,363
What do you want me to do here?

927
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:48,599
Turn him over to the law.

928
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:50,968
I would
gladly do that,

929
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,270
But, at this point,

930
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,604
I don't think
we got enough proof.

931
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,273
Hah!

932
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:56,741
One thing
I do know, though.

933
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,309
Ain't no way you two

934
00:52:58,343 --> 00:52:59,844

to work together again.

935
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:03,348
Trampas, I'm gonna
have to let you go.

936

You're gonna believe this
washed-up old has-been over me?

937

He's just trying
to get his damn job back!

938
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,289
Sorry, trampas.
I'm letting you go.

939
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:13,524
Out of fairness,

940
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,760
We'll set up
some sort of severance.

943

944
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,572
Yeah.

00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:39,650
I got the judge
to fire him.

949

the right thing.

When you catch a fox
in your henhouse,

953
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:53,464
You don't just run him off
and forget about it.

954
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:57,802
It'll come back
for more of your chickens.

955
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:00,405
What do you mean?

956
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,307
I mean trampas.

957
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:14,652

958
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,754
You holding a gun?

959

Well, after what happened,

960
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,057
It seemed to be
a prudent course of action.

961
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,959
Nobody needs to kill you,
Owen, they were after me.

962
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,828
But if I'm going to be spending
more time with you,

00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,763
Then i... hang on.
Why do you have books?

964

do you read?

These are schoolbooks.

967
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:37,842
You got new textbooks
for miss west, didn't you?

968
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,345
Thought
I'd surprise her.

969
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:41,912

have those wrapped.

970

Mm-hmm.

972
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:13,544
I think we're well past that,
don't you?

973
00:55:13,578 --> 00:55:15,746
Well...

974
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,357
Where did you find these?

975
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:29,660
Well, it took some diggin'
and about a month's pay,

976
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:31,662
But I hear tell

977
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,665
Those're about the best damn
schoolbooks you can find.

978
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,934
Thank you.

979
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,640
You know,
you didn't have to do that.

980
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,709
I know that.

981
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:51,882
So, seems like
you're recovering nicely.

982
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,784
Are you
taking it easy?

983
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:56,120
Nah, there's no time
for relaxing.

985

To chase down
those rustlers.

986

I'm told it's a sin

987
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,963
Worse than murder
in Wyoming.

988
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:06,897
Yeah.

989
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,934
Depends on who's getting killed,
I suppose.

990
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:17,575
Have you ever had to
deal with a rustler?

991
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,110
Personally, I mean.

992
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:22,079
Yes.

993
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,748
And?

994
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:24,915
And what?

995
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:27,552
Did I string him up?

996
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:29,987
It's my job.

997
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,028
So I suppose
I should properly thank you

998

For volunteering me
a place to stay.

has holes in the roof.

that are here

care of themselves.

Are you insinuating

1009

That I can't
take care of myself?

you do just fine.

to take you out tomorrow,

01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:17,901
Yeah! That's right!

1258
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,369
You should've
said something!

1259
01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:20,470
Stop it!

1260
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:22,739
Stop! Stop...

1261
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:29,646
You know what
the code is for?

1262
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,148
To keep law and order?

1263
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,517
It's to protect

1264
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,018
The judge Henrys
of the world,

1265
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:37,086
That's what it's for.

1266
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:47,431
We've lost
the trail anyway.

1267
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:51,100
I hate Wyoming.

1268
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,572
[***]

1269
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:04,748
Here.

1270
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,886
Steve wanted you
to have that.

1271
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:20,830
To Steve.

1272
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,925
I don't think I want
to talk to her yet.

1273
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,494
You're gonna
have to talk to her

1274
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:52,462
Sooner or later.

1275
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:54,631
The look on her face,
it might be sooner.

1276
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,601
Excuse me.

1277
01:13:57,634 --> 01:13:59,636
Welcome home, boys.

1278
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:03,039
I'm sorry about Steve,

1279
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:05,008
But, uh...

1280
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,010
He knew the work
he was getting into.

1281
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:08,812
He was riding
with trampas.

1282
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:10,780
How do you know that?
Did he confess?

1283
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:15,218
No, sir. He didn't give us
any names before he died.

1284
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,521
Well...

1285
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:18,922
Just forget about trampas.

1286
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:22,091
He's working
for balin now, anyway.

1287
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:25,028
Trampas is doing this
on his own, judge.

1288
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:26,563
Right now I'm more
worried about

1289
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:28,231
What Molly
thinks about me.

1290
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:31,635
I had a talk with Molly,

1291
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:33,169
And I explained to her

1292
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:34,137
That what you did

1293
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,539
Is just like
what a judge does...

1294
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:37,807
Doling out punishment.

1295
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:40,544
You go talk to her.

1296
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,089
[Molly slaps South]

1297
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,797
And this is where
I think I should

1298
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,899
Excuse myself
to take a warm bath

1299
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:04,701
And change into
some clean clothes.

1300
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:13,777
I got a job.

1301
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,044
Get two men

1302
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:17,547
And meet me
at the stables.

1303
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:35,599
[Knocks]

1304
01:15:42,739 --> 01:15:45,074
Molly, I gotta
talk to you,

1305
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:47,143
And you got to
listen to me.

1306
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,719
Do I?

1307
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:03,159
I think I know what
you think of me.

1308
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:05,929
And, uh, I thought

1309
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:08,264
I was just
doing my job,

1310
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:11,200
But I was wrong.

1311
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,772
I hope we can...

1312
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:18,307
Get past this.

1313
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:22,912
Can you get past this?

1314
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,052
[Huffs emotionally,
stifles himself]

1315
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,789
He needed help.

1316
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:35,291
He needed help
and I killed him.

1317
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,826
I killed him.

1318
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,027
[Sighs]

1319
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,669
Molly...

1320
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:47,804
You just shut up for once.

1321
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:58,848
[Exhales deeply]

1322
01:16:58,882 --> 01:17:01,117
You did what
you thought was right.

1323
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,353
And we all do.

1324
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,892
That's why I've decided

1325
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:11,327
I'm leaving tomorrow
for Vermont.

1326
01:17:12,696 --> 01:17:13,830
What about the school?

1327
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:15,098
Who's gonna...

1328
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,166
Who's gonna teach?

1329
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,202
I've written
for a replacement.

1330
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:21,905
The new teacher will
be here in two weeks.

1331
01:17:21,938 --> 01:17:23,840
Don't.

1332
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:25,675
Please.

1333
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,113
I have to.

1334
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:06,482
I'm taking Molly to Cheyenne
in the morning.

1335
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,718
She's going home.

1336
01:18:08,752 --> 01:18:11,855
Alright.

1337
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,323
And I'm going with her.

1338
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,460
If she'll have me.

1339
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:25,034
It is a long train ride
to do by myself.

1340
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:31,407
[Starts chuckling]

1341
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,242
What's so funny?

1342
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:36,946
I'm just havin' a hard time...

1343
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,182
Picturing you in Vermont,
is all.

1344
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:42,752
I got some business
in Cheyenne myself.

1345
01:18:42,786 --> 01:18:43,820
Oh, really?

1346
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:46,055
Like what?

1347
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:50,526
I'm gonna take this
to the U.S. marshals.

1348
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,261
Maybe they can find
the guilty parties.

1349
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:54,931
I can round up
a whole lot more gunmen

1350
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:56,265
Than the U.S. government can.

1351
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:58,534
You oughta just give it here.

1352
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,338
If it's all the same to you,
I'll take it to Cheyenne.

1353
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:07,243
I want trampas to pay.

1354
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:10,013
You know, we sent some people
out to find balin.

1355
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:12,248
He's at the root
of all this trouble.

1356
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:15,218
Balin's too scared of the noose
to have anything to do with it.

1357
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,986
He's the one
that hired trampas.

1358
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:19,255
You hired him, too.

1359
01:19:20,957 --> 01:19:23,159
What are you insinuatin', son?

1360
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,527
[South]: Not a thing.

1361
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:27,563
I'm just sayin' again

1362
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,099
That I don't think
balin's a thief.

1363
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,837
They're not going to
hurt him, are they?

1364
01:19:35,371 --> 01:19:37,941
They will
serve justice, ma'am.

1365
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:40,343
[Molly]:
I understand all too well

1366
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:43,579
What constitutes "justice"
in Wyoming.

1367
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,680
[Judge]: We got a...

1368
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:47,550
Way of life we're trying
to protect out here, ma'am.

1369
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:51,487
[Shot rings out]

1370
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,457
Balin ain't done nothin'
to deserve your kind of justice.

1371
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,691
South...

1372
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,928
Why don't you just come out
and say what you want to say?

1373
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,596
I'm sick of

1374
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,932
The way you push
those small ranchers around.

1375
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:04,968
One of these days, one of 'em's
gonna push back.

1376
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,469
Yeah. And that,

1377
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:08,171
That's gonna be
somethin' worth seeing.

1378
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:09,839
Lynching a man
for stealing?

1379
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,878
Where theft
is worth a man's life.

1380
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:15,879
[Heavy thud]

1381
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:25,088
[Chair scrapes floor]

1382
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:27,256
Someday,
you'll pay for what you've done.

1383
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:29,125
I'm gonna pay?

1384
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,194
[Sets cutlery down]

1385
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:33,162
What is it I'm gonna pay for?

1386
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:34,931
Did you forget
who you're talking to?

1387
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:39,235
I've got the taste of bile
on my tongue because of you.

1388
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:40,569
Come on, Molly.

1389
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:42,005
Oh, so all of a sudden,
you're so high and mighty,

1390
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:44,040
'Cause you got yourself
a proper woman, huh?

1391
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:45,574
You keep her
out of this.

1392
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:47,576
And noble, too, huh?

1393
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:49,378
Let's not forget,

1394
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:51,147
You got blood
on your hands.

1395
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,248
Lots of it,

1396
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:55,184
And there never was
any cause for it.

1397
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,452
Do you have any idea

1398
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,888
How lawless this place
would be without me?

1399
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,423
I am the order!

1400
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:02,091
I am civilization!

1401
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:06,029
I made peace
where there was only chaos.

1402
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,597
I decide who dies around here!

1403
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:15,604
[***]

1404
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,474
And who lives, too.

1405
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:23,412
Where are you
going, son?

1406
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:26,449
Sorry, but I seem
to have lost my appetite.

1407
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:34,090
I'll be leaving
tomorrow as well.

1408
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:37,360
That book of yours
finished?

1409
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,663
All except for
the ending.

1410
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:51,407
[Wagon rumbling]

1411
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,644
A word.

1412
01:21:58,114 --> 01:21:59,983
Whoa. Whoa.

1413
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:11,527
Wait for me
at the general store.

1414
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,997
Be careful.
Please.

1415
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:17,066
Walk on.

1416
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,202
Trampas wanted me

1417
01:22:19,235 --> 01:22:20,503
To pass along a message
to you.

1418
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:23,372
You and him,
in front of the gallows, 4:00.

1419
01:22:23,406 --> 01:22:26,109
Since when
are you his message boy?

1420
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:28,011
I ain't nobody's message boy.

1421
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:30,179
Maybe you ought
to ask me

1422
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:31,314
To take my gun off again.

1423
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:34,650
A lot easier to talk big
when you got a judge behind you.

1424
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,120
Not so much
when you're by your lonesome.

1425
01:22:37,153 --> 01:22:38,454
I'm not alone.

1426
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:41,324
Mm. I remember when
the judge took you in,

1427
01:22:41,357 --> 01:22:43,626
A few years after
they found your father.

1428
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:46,595
You used to cry yourself
to sleep at night, like a baby.

1429
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:50,233
Boys used to joke
about it all the time.

1430
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:51,767
You been thinking
you're better than us

1431
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,336
Far too long.

1432
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:55,304
You're nothing more
than a dirty penny

1433
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:58,574
Someone saw fit
to try and shine once.

1434
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:00,376
You done?

1435
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:03,546
I'll be seeing you
in hell, South.

1436
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:04,680
Hey, you might be getting there

1437
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,549
A lot quicker
than you think, Broyles.

1438
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:20,029
I'm not going to
miss Wyoming.

1439
01:23:20,063 --> 01:23:22,231
Not one bit.

1440
01:23:22,265 --> 01:23:24,167
It's awfully pretty,

1441
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,169
For what it's worth.

1442
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:27,703
That's true.

1443
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,738
It's an evil
place, though.

1444
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:40,049
I've been called out
by trampas at 4:00.

1445
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:42,785
You don't
have to do this.

1446
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:45,354
This is something
that can't be left unfinished.

1447
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:50,193
We can leave
all this behind.

1448
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:51,694
I can't leave here a coward.

1449
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:53,129
That's not
important to me.

1450
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:54,730
It's important to me.

1451
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,365
It's important
to every other person

1452
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:59,502
That'd ever cross paths
with that snake.

1453
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,571
[Sighs tensely]

1454
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:04,473
I want you both
to stay here,

1455
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:06,142
Out of harm's way.

1456
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:08,711
I've been in harm's way
plenty lately.

1457
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:12,415
Owen, I'm asking you
to look after Molly.

1458
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:14,450
I don't need
to be looked after,

1459
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:16,085
And you don't need
to get yourself killed.

1460
01:24:16,119 --> 01:24:18,254
I'm not plannin' on it.

1461
01:24:19,422 --> 01:24:22,691
If you do this...

1462
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:24,793
I'm leaving.

1463
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:27,196
Right now,

1464
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,265
And I'm not coming back.

1465
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:33,269
You mean that?

1466
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:38,674
That it'd be the... end?

1467
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:40,276
Of us?

1468
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:44,313
[Takes a shaky breath
and sighs]

1469
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:47,850
Can you look me in the eye
and tell me that, Molly?

1470
01:24:52,155 --> 01:24:55,791
Well, that's how
it's gonna be?

1471
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,227
[Sighs heavily]

1472
01:24:58,261 --> 01:25:01,130
Sure you want to do this?

1473
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,833
I have no choice.

1474
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:07,170
I understand.

1475
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:10,473
[***]

1476
01:25:21,417 --> 01:25:23,852
[Sighs]

1477
01:25:27,823 --> 01:25:30,459
Walk on.

1478
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:41,470
[***]

1479
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,442
[Bellows]: Come out!

1480
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,611
In the open!

1481
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,846
Coward!

1482
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,581
South, look out!

1483
01:25:52,615 --> 01:25:54,450
[Exchanging fire]

1484
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,485
[Trampas cries out]

1485
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:06,229
[Shot rings out]

1486
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,768
[***]

1487
01:26:13,836 --> 01:26:16,505
You gut-shot me,
you bastard!

1488
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:17,873
I meant to.

1489
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:20,543
You deserve to die
slow and painful.

1490
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:23,412
Everything I done,
I done on orders.

1491
01:26:23,446 --> 01:26:25,214
What do you mean?

1492
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:26,549
You stole all them
cattle, didn't you?

1493
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:28,817
Every one of them, you idiot.

1494
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:31,287
I already knew that.
I saw your ledger.

1495
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,755
[Chuckling]

1496
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:35,758
It was the judge's ledger.

1497
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:38,461
You lie like a dog
even when you die.

1498
01:26:38,494 --> 01:26:40,996
Why would he steal
his own stock?

1499
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,566
God, you're stupid.

1500
01:26:43,599 --> 01:26:46,635
If he can pin it on balin

1501
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:49,772
And them other
penny-ante ranchers,

1502
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,974
Then he gets all the land,

1503
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:53,809
And all the water!

1504
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:56,479
Hell...

1505
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,481
You know what they call that?

1506
01:26:58,514 --> 01:27:01,384
A monopoly. [Laughing]

1507
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:06,955
Yeah, he's wanted you dead
for some time now.

1508
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:10,726
He paid me to kill you today!

1509
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:13,562
Finish
what I started.

1510
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:16,399
Guess he never got
his money's worth.

1511
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:21,804
[Gasps weakly]

1512
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,439
I guess he didn't.

1513
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,343
[Sighs]

1514
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,712
[Gun fires]

1515
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,814
Get your hands
where I can see 'em.

1516
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:34,983
[***]

1517
01:27:37,453 --> 01:27:39,588
Lose the weapons, South.

1518
01:27:43,392 --> 01:27:45,461
[***]

1519
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,465
All of 'em, South.

1520
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,611
[Crack]

1521
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:12,355
[***]

1522
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:21,464
Want anything
done right around here,

1523
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:22,631
You got to do it yourself.

1524
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:26,335
Down on your knees.

1525
01:28:35,778 --> 01:28:38,381
You can't
shoot me, judge.

1526
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:39,415
[Chuckles]

1527
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:41,650
I can do
anything I want.

1528
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:50,826
[Sighs irately]

1529
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:52,895
You were gonna
be my heir.

1530
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:55,998
Till you had to go believing
that the "code"

1531
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:58,767
Was for everybody,
even folks like me.

1532
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:00,569
The code ain't about murder.

1533
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:03,372
Found that ledger...

1534
01:29:03,406 --> 01:29:05,641
I knew it was just
a matter of time

1535
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,676
Before you figured
that out, so...

1536
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:10,513
Well, I couldn't
let that stand.

1537
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:14,683
[South fumes]

1538
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:20,489
I seen that look
a time or two.

1539
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:23,091
Those of us
who have seen it

1540
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:26,595
May have plenty of reason
to be scared.

1541
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:28,964
The way I figure,

1542
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:31,700
This here's right
out of scripture.

1543
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:34,803
You know?

1544
01:29:34,837 --> 01:29:35,971
How like

1545
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:38,741
When God asked Abraham
to kill his son.

1546
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:42,811
Except, this time,

1547
01:29:42,845 --> 01:29:45,581
There ain't gonna be no God
to save your ass.

1548
01:29:46,749 --> 01:29:48,617
Just like there was no God
to save your pa,

1549
01:29:48,651 --> 01:29:50,953
Down in that river valley.

1550
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:53,589
He was just a...

1551
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:56,592
Stupid two-bit rancher
who couldn't take a hint.

1552
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:58,461
You son of a bitch.

1553
01:30:04,967 --> 01:30:05,968
[Shot fires]

1554
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:08,571
[Coughs and sputters]

1555
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:17,446
[Thud]

[Gasping weakly]

1557
01:30:28,491 --> 01:30:31,594
I-it hurts...

1558
01:30:31,627 --> 01:30:34,096
Just hang in there,
tenderfoot.

1559
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:36,499
My book...

1560
01:30:36,532 --> 01:30:39,802
Bury it with me.

1561
01:30:39,835 --> 01:30:42,638
[***]

1562
01:30:50,646 --> 01:30:52,648
[Thud]

1563
01:30:56,685 --> 01:31:00,489
I still don't understand
why we're doing this.

1564
01:31:00,523 --> 01:31:02,925
It's symbolic.

1565
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:08,030
That part of
my life is over now.

1566
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:10,566
[South sighs]

1567
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:12,701
Awful lot of land down here

1568
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:16,038
For two shot-up ol' cowboys
to try to take care of.

1569
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:18,641
Might have to make some changes
out here.

1570
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:20,743
What do you think, Molly?

1571
01:31:20,776 --> 01:31:22,511
I think if we spend

1572
01:31:22,545 --> 01:31:23,912
Too much more
time together,

1573
01:31:23,946 --> 01:31:24,980
You're going to have to

1574
01:31:25,013 --> 01:31:27,182
Make an honest woman
out of me.

1575
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:28,684
Hmm.

1576
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:31,219
Well, I will,
if you'll let me.

1577
