Two whores!

193
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,228
Where are they?

194
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,397
They are my property and I will have them.

195
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,401
You, come here.

196
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:14,836
Come here.

197
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,607
Go ahead.

Let me see your faces.

202
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:40,127
Look at 'em.

203
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,364
Plums.

204
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:48,502
You'd be a man, you walk into a whorehouse,

205
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:53,974
you see these virgins and angels descended.

206
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,310
Maybe payroll don't
matter for a week or two?

207
00:14:57,312 --> 00:15:00,380
Maybe your investors swell,

208
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,048
and so with their investments?

209
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,987
Maybe you don't require your pa's dollars?

210
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,889
Captain Slotter, I am Mrs. Fogg.

211
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,391
You were to deliver me to
Janestown two days past,

212
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,392
but you never came.

213
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,427
You left me with no means to feed myself...

214
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:22,067
[quietly] Stop it, George.

215
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,676

[Gasping]

217
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,249
It's just trunks and equipment, Sir.

218
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,185
You can see there's no
place for a body to ride.

219
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,353

There's none of your property in it.

224
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,165
I'll show you myself.

225
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,233
Have a look.

226
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:03,541
Is that to your satisfaction?

227
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:05,243
Are you afraid of girls, Sir?

228
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,179
So am I.

229
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:10,248
Leave him be.

230
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,401
One day, you'll go too far, Kat.

231
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:34,137

The bridge is out?

251
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,484
Delay will do us good.

Like a Sunday after church.

253
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:02,453

I hope you're not
inconvenienced, Mr. Loving.

Well, there is the question of

257
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:18,234
what to do with the girls, Dr. Blithely.

258
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:20,804
I thought someone here might take them.

259

No, but...

Then you take them.

No. There's one horse and it's for me.

300
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:23,590
We've organized a hunting party.

301
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:24,890
Mr. Loving's to lead us.

302
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,627
He's been on safari in Africa.

303
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:29,829
When... when will you be back, then?

304
00:20:29,831 --> 00:20:31,430
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Loving
have recently been married.

305
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:32,932
They haven't a chance to celebrate,

306
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:35,735
so I arranged a wedding party.

307
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,608
It's a fitting goodbye

308
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,279
to be among these people,
in the middle of life.

309
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,962
It's a wedding party, for us.

310

Come on, Kat.

311
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,835
I saw a woman with a dead baby yesterday.

312

I have the feeling of death all around me.

313
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,413
You and I...

314
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,914
will be together forever.

315
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:28,085
We'll be surrounded by our children,

316
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,620
and there will be generations of us

317
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,356
to the end of the world.

318
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,546
Mrs. Blithely.

319
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,715
Tell me about yourself.

320
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,954
My father found me strange.

321
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:08,891
Sent me to Bedlam as a child.

322
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:10,359
Bedlam?

323
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,728
A madhouse?

324
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,997
It was Thomas who found me there.

325
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,966
Took me home.

326
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,367
Thomas and his wife, Emily,

327
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:22,071
they raised me as their own.

328
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,140
She died two months back.

329
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:27,008
So he married you.

00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:32,047
Thomas is educating me
by way of experiment.

331
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,050
I'm interested in surgical procedure

332
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:37,419
and the function of organs.

333
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,587
You've cut into a living thing?

334
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,524
I held a beating heart in my hand once,

335
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,093
and I wrote a paper about it.

336
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:46,694
It was published,

337
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:48,130
under Thomas's name, of course.

338
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:50,932
I am shown at scientific gatherings.

339

I am called "The woman of genius."

340
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:54,870
They tell me my abilities
derive from my head,

341
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:55,871
which is too small,

342
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:56,838
and my brain, which is over-large,

343
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,140
and presses acutely against my skull,

344
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,907
and these facts, I am told,

345
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:02,076
explain my facilities
with numbers and processes.

346
00:23:12,053 --> 00:23:14,889
What if that man, Slotter, comes back?

347
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:19,093
He has no claim.

348
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:20,895
They're my daughters.

349
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:28,735
You would kill him?

350
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:39,179
Out here...

351
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:41,047

I'm worried.

360
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,720
There's another story I will tell you.

fiercest Indians of all.

They tie men to stakes
and light 'em on fire.

The big ones got enough fat on them

365

Of course, the Indians hereabouts,

they got their own tricks.

369

Ask her.

370
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:44,075
She knows.

371
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:47,612
Now, I hear she buried
a child the other day.

372
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:49,347

565
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,055
Bellyache.

566
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:10,891
It's his conscience pricking.

567
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:14,461
Most times, fit to puke.

568
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:17,997
'Twas meat I ate two days past.

569
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:19,900
The day your child was born?

570
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:24,938
What is this?

571
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,074
This is Isabelle's tonic.

572
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,875
I just started. It helps some.

573
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,777
[Sniffing]

574
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:35,148
I can offer you the recipe.

575
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,849
You must keep it to yourself.

576
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:39,919
I shall get back to our guests.

577
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,889
You take your rest.

578
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:04,242
Miss Kelly!

579
00:39:04,244 --> 00:39:05,844
Ma'am...

580
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:07,212
The gentleman was needing a drink,

581
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:08,847
so I just brought him...

582
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:12,116
Let them go.

583
00:39:12,118 --> 00:39:14,285
The house owns these girls.

584
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:15,987
You know what it is to lose a child.

585
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:18,322
Let them go.

586
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:19,423
[Slotter]: Izzy!

587
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,861
Isabelle!

588
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,831
The women who arrived
in the cribs last night,

589
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:29,033
it was your husband killed their men.

590
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,401
It was Indians.

591
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:31,869
He killed my boy.

592
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,071
Strung him up in a
tree. Cut his tongue out.

593
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:35,206
It was Indians,

594
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,240
and you're a liar.

595
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:37,875
[Slotter]: Isabelle?

596
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,310
Don't call to him.

597
00:39:39,312 --> 00:39:41,178
You keep quiet,

598
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,946
or I will tell him about your tonic.

599
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,951
Arsenic will kill a man, not heal him.

600
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:52,589
You were deliberate in your intention.

601
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,263
My husband took my child's
body and put it out.

602
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,199
There was a coyote there.

603
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,569
She was bitten.

604
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,870
She was tasted.

605
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,575
Get out.

606
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:21,884
[Slotter]: Isabelle!

607
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:22,885
I'm coming!

608
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,494
God forgive me.

609
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,629
Izzy?

610
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,648
Are you feeling any better?

611
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,316
Whiskey's the healer.

612
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:58,987
[Chuckles mirthlessly]

613
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:20,641
Sleep of angels.

614
00:41:42,463 --> 00:41:43,497
Thank you, ma'am.

615
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:45,265
For everything.

616
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:49,569
I found this.

617
00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:50,637
It's yours.

618
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:57,476
You saw me take it.

619
00:41:57,478 --> 00:41:58,678
I'm awful sorry for the trick.

620
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,079
I won't ever again.

621
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:03,315
Thomas gave it to me.

622
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:04,550
A wedding gift.

623
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:08,087
Well, hearts mean love.

624
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:12,324
A heart is a pump.

625
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,298
Good night.

626
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,332
Good night.

627
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:23,335
[Crashing outside]

628
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:26,372
[Bottles clanking]

629
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:29,441
Is it him?

630
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:31,509
Bear, could be.

631
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:33,211
Or coyote.

632
00:42:33,213 --> 00:42:34,279
He won't be back here tonight.

633
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:37,315
We're safe to sleep?

634
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:38,650
Yes.

635
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,431
You know this is Canada, ma.

636
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,657
There is no law here but our own.

637
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:24,794
<i>My husband is not a murderer.</i>

638
00:43:24,796 --> 00:43:26,729
<i>He killed 20 men.</i>

639
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:28,163
You shut your mouth!

640
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:30,165
<i>I'll ride out, find Jeremiah and Neil.</i>

641
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,367
What if they're dead?

642
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:33,135
No! Mama!

643
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:34,337
<i>Take me instead.</i>

644
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:35,238
<i>Announcer: Strange Empire,</i>

645
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,340
<i>next Monday at 9:00 on CBC.</i>
