1
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:07,918
Where'd you learn to
make coffee like this?

2
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,003
Campin'.

3
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:10,588
I was a Girl Scout.

4
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:13,006
- A Girl Scout?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:14,175
Still got the uniform?

6
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:15,468
[chuckles]

7
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:18,763
Yeah, but it's too small and
it smells like cookies.

8
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,348
All right, stop.

9
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,641
I know what I want for Christmas.

10
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,354
Colt, you used my towel again, asshole.

11
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:28,356
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,691
It's just so dark up in the
bathroom with the power out,

13
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,193
I don't know what I'm reaching for.

14
00:00:33,527 --> 00:00:35,321
But, full disclosure...

15
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:36,950
I may have wiped with the sock

16
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,932
that you left outside by the hamper.

17
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,828
Full disclosure, I've
been wearing your socks.

18
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:45,498
Should I not bring
clothes over here anymore?

19
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:47,625
- Come on, let's go to work.
- Yeah.

20
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,543
- Thank you, darling.
- Mmm-hmm.

21
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:50,879
Hey, you wanna meet up tonight?

22
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:53,589
I don't know. I'm supposed to
hang out with my sister, Darlene.

23
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,313
She just got through
a really bad breakup.

24
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:57,468
Bad breakup, huh? She sounds hot.

25
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:00,138
She is hot.

26
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:02,556
And she finally got rid of that
deadbeat asshole of a boyfriend.

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,808
Oh.

28
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:04,909
Well, would you say

29
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:07,127
deadbeat assholes are kind of her type?

30
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:10,690
Hey, she just got out of a relationship.

31
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:13,276
Yeah, her ex left her right
after the baby was born.

32
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,069
Might be a good change for
her to go out with a nice guy.

33
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,754
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah, so we're in agreement.

34
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:18,865
She should not go out with Rooster.

35
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:21,325
Stop, he is a good guy.

36
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:22,911
Maybe the four of us could go out.

37
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:24,954
Rooster don't like blind dates, so...

38
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:26,539
Oh, uh, hell yeah, I do.

39
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:29,333
I mean, dating is
like fishing, you know?

40
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,294
You can sit on the water
all day and not catch a bite.

41
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:32,628
But a blind date?

42
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:33,758
That's like a guy drives up

43
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:35,296
in a boat and just throws you a fish.

44
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:39,135
After that, all you gotta
do is clean it and eat it.

45
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:42,346
You must really hate your sister.

46
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,183
Stop. It'll be fun.

47
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:48,937
- Promise. I'll tell Darlene.
- [Rooster] Mmm-hmm.

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,271
- Call me later.
- [Colt] Yeah.

49
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:53,775
Oh, hey, don't forget to look for
that Girl Scout uniform. [chuckles]

50
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:57,236
Hey, you hear that, pal? It'll be fun.

51
00:01:58,321 --> 00:01:59,948
[Colt] Hey. Hey.

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,617
Yo, come on. You cannot
go out with Darlene.

53
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,453
- Why not?
- 'Cause I've...

54
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:08,706
got a good thing going
with Heather, and I'd...

55
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:11,167
I just... I know how you are with women.

56
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,543
You mean awesome?

57
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:16,630
Yeah, so awesome that
Cindy Wilson keyed your car?

58
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:18,591
[chuckles] That was an accident.

59
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:20,230
Yeah, oh, she accidentally wrote,

60
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:21,994
"Rooster Bennett's got a tiny penis"?

61
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:26,349
Technically, she wrote, "Rooster
Bennett's got a tiny pen,"

62
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,892
'cause I caught her.

63
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,521
That's why I bought all those tiny
pens just to not confuse anybody.

64
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,440
What about Tammy?

65
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:36,567
She was so pissed, she
set your underwear on fire.

66
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,569
[scoffs] So? Big deal.

67
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:40,446
You were still wearing 'em!

68
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,742
Look, man, that was a
long time ago, all right?

69
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:46,906
I'm not gonna do anything
to mess up you and Heather.

70
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,663
All right. Just behave.

71
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:51,582
Yeah, that's my middle name.

72
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:54,710
Jameson "Rooster" "Behave"
"Big Dick" Bennett. [scoffs]

[yawns] Man, I'm exhausted.

- Yeah, me too.
- [yawns]

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,982
If somebody told me there was

79
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,189
a million dollars out in that field,

80
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:15,624
I don't know if I could go pick it up.

81
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,376
[chuckles] Still going
to the bar, right?

82
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,461
Oh, hell yeah.

83
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:24,175
How is it that you two are so
tired at the end of every day,

84
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,110
but you still muster enough energy

85
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,827
to go out drinking every night?

86
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:30,263
'Cause it ain't work when
you're doing something you love.

87
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,102
That Mom?

88
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:35,811
Yeah.

89
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:37,355
Said she wanted to talk.

90
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,857
Oh, well, as fun as that sounds,

91
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,986
I'm gonna make like
Colt and abandon this family.

92
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,364
I resent that.

93
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:49,200
And just to prove a point, I'll
stay out here with you, Dad.

94
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:52,870
[grunts] Hey, Ma.

95
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,706
Colt, could we have a minute?

96
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:57,416
I gave it a shot.

97
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,924
Maggie, I know I said I
could talk, but... [sighs]

98
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,801
I've been up since 4:00 this morning.

99
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,472
How about we do this another day?

100
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,849
Unless you've got some really good news.

101
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,435
I made us an
appointment to go to counseling.

102
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,853
That wasn't it.

103
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,649
I know you don't wanna
talk about your feelings.

104
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,110
When the guy at the gas
station says, "How you doing?"

105
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,154
you tell him to stop prying.

106
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,198
If I wanted him to know, he'd know.

107
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,035
Okay, well...

108
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,246
I don't wanna get divorced.

109
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:38,958
[grunts softly]

110
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:42,461
Well, I hate talking to
strangers and I hate spending money.

111
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:44,422
Now you're asking me to do both?

112
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:46,882
No. We won't have to pay...

113
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:48,801
and it won't be a total stranger.

114
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:52,096
Priscilla, in my book
club, she's a licensed therapist.

115
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:54,723
She helped out Noreen and Will.

116
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:58,852
Will left Noreen for
Stan at the feed store.

117
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,441
And she helped Will to
realize his true feelings.

118
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:06,277
I could've told Will that 20 years ago.

119
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:09,363
I really do think it will help us.

120
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,157
She's an expert on marriage.

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,284
And what makes her an expert?

122
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,343
The fact that your book club read

123
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:16,936
Bridges of Madison County?

124
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:21,084
This is my busiest time of the year.

125
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,418
I know you're busy.

126
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,503
But there'll always be
a reason to put it off.

127
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:27,715
All right, we agree. Let's never do it.

128
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,801
You want me to move back in, right?

129
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,262
'Course I do.

130
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:35,179
Well, the only way that's gonna happen

131
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:36,706
is if we start connecting more.

132
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,811
I really do think it would
help us to see Priscilla.

133
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:43,188
And afterwards, I'll treat
you to a burger if you want.

134
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:46,109
If I'm sharing feelings,
I'm eating steak.

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,445
Well, let's see how
the first session goes.

136
00:06:49,528 --> 00:06:51,489
Wait a minute. There's more than one?

137
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,458
So, Darlene, how do you
scratch out a living?

138
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,793
Well, four days a
week, Mom watches the kids

139
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,670
and I work down at the nursing home.

140
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:07,803
Mostly, my job consists

141
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,697
of dealing with cranky senior citizens.

142
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:11,592
Mmm-hmm. Hey, mine too.

143
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,262
You guys are ranchers, right?

144
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:16,013
Yeah, Colt works on my ranch.

145
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:18,766
You like being a rancher?

146
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,018
Did Jesus like being a carpenter?

147
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:23,729
What?

148
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,403
No, I'm just saying, you know,

149
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:26,756
I didn't choose it, it chose me.

150
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,735
I mean, ranching game's tough, you know?

151
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:31,987
You gotta be strong, muscular,

152
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,117
but also sensitive, gentle, you
know, with a real caring touch.

153
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:39,537
Are you fucking kidding me?

154
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,374
Well, I may have used some
bold imagery, but I...

155
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,031
My ex just posted a picture

156
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,444
with him and his skanky new girlfriend.

157
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:49,304
Is that the trashiest
bikini you've ever seen?

158
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:52,133
Oh, come on, you are
so much hotter than her.

159
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,177
Yeah. Well, they're...
[stuttering] Those are...

160
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,928
That... Those are too big.

161
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:59,932
I should, uh, probably weigh in on this.

162
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:02,476
What an ass!

163
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,520
[chuckles] Yeah. What an ass.

164
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,357
Listen, Darlene, forget about him.

165
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,193
We're all having a good time here.

166
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,529
You're right. I'm sorry.

167
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:16,114
Oh, that's all right. You
know, he's the loser, 'cause...

168
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,784
my date's way prettier
than his. [chuckles]

169
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,227
I'm guessing, 'cause I didn't
really get to see the picture.

170
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,372
Are you shitting me?

171
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:26,083
Is that the Eiffel Tower?

172
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,252
Whoa! He took her to Vegas?

173
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:32,130
This asshole, the father
of one of my children,

174
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:34,342
is getting married to this dick garage.

175
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,428
[chuckles] All right,
man, I like this chick.

176
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:40,306
I'm never getting married.

177
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,420
I'm gonna be one of
those pathetic losers

178
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:43,750
who lives at home forever.

179
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,187
- Oh, you know, that's just like family...
- There's no shame in that.

180
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,564
- Togetherness is really a move...
- Eff my effing L!

181
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,024
Darlene...

182
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,029
Well, she seems stable.

183
00:08:57,573 --> 00:08:58,866
Yeah, no kidding.

184
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,035
Hey, how's that chick, huh?

185
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:04,663
She got them tig ol' bitties?

186
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,750
[scoffs] I'm gonna get another round.

187
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,834
[sighs]

188
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:11,629
Two.

189
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:13,797
Oh, shit. Hey, Abby.

190
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:16,842
Hey, Colt. What is all that
yelling coming from your table?

191
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:20,095
Oh, yeah, Rooster's on a blind date.

192
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,222
Got it.

193
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,559
Uh, where's, uh, Kenny?

194
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:27,128
On Fridays, she waits here

195
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:29,379
for him to get off from the Marriott.

196
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,440
And then, they usually go see a movie.

197
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:36,654
Sorry for me taking an
interest in my friends.

198
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,532
[chuckles softly]

199
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,242
I see you're still with Heather.

200
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,995
So, when you guys go out, does
she order off the kids' menu?

201
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,040
No, as long as they have crayons

202
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:50,334
so she can draw on the
place mat, she's happy.

203
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:52,875
What do you do, you just sit around

204
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,111
all day and think these things up?

205
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:56,674
Yeah, in detention I
run 'em by the kids.

206
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,968
You know, 'cause
they're the same age as Heather.

207
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,345
[groans]

208
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,432
[chuckling] That one's
mine. I just came up with that.

209
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:05,683
- I'll give you that one.
- [chuckles]

210
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:07,017
Hey, uh, I got your text.

211
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,895
Your... your truck's
still making that... noise?

212
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:12,022
Yeah. I replaced the
fan belt like you said

213
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:13,857
but, uh, it's still doing it.

214
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:18,279
[stutters] Is it like a high
pitch... Like a... [imitates squealing]

215
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:20,739
No, it's more like
a... [imitates growling]

216
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:24,618
You drivin' a truck or a bear?

217
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,955
Hey, you know what? Bring it by
the house. I'll take a look at it.

218
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:30,291
- Thanks, I will.
- Yeah.

219
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:32,418
Don't you have to get back to your date?

220
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:33,794
He wants to...

221
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:37,130
but Rooster's date's all
broken up about her ex.

222
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,593
Oh, Hank, you gotta...

223
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:43,596
Actually, he's right. [chuckles]

224
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,930
Hey. I'll see ya, Ab.

225
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:46,223
See you.

226
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,517
- Hey.
- [Rooster sighs]

227
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,060
Where's Darlene?

228
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:53,606
She's really upset. I
think I gotta take her home.

229
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:54,815
Damn.

230
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,359
That's all right. I'll get her home.

231
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,569
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I don't mind.

232
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:00,195
You guys have fun.

233
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:01,530
Thank you.

234
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:02,571
Um, and once you get her home,

235
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,806
Mom can take care of the rest of it.

236
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,576
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'll get her.

237
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:09,121
Hey.

238
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:11,039
Remember what we talked about.

239
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:13,083
I don't want anything messing
things up with me and Heather.

240
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,253
Relax, man, I will be
a complete gentleman.

241
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:20,383
Hey, can I borrow a couple
quarters for the condom machine?

242
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,134
Dude!

243
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:24,512
I'm kidding... I already got some.

244
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,180
Dude!

245
00:11:27,264 --> 00:11:30,100
I'm joking, man. Shit, you
know I don't use condoms.

246
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:38,066
Hi, Priscilla.

247
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,943
Hi, Maggie. Hello, Beau.

248
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:42,029
Glad you two decided to come.

249
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,822
I'm not laying on a couch.

250
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:46,617
Well, I don't even have a couch in here.

251
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:49,703
What kind of a
therapist doesn't have a couch?

252
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:56,293
Now, I should start by saying
that, though this is my home,

253
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:59,004
please consider it a
completely professional place.

254
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:01,110
Uh, however, I do ask that if you need

255
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:02,949
to use the restroom, please knock,

256
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:06,804
as my teenage son, Justin, recently
discovered his body.

257
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,015
Okay, so...

258
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:12,810
let's talk about your marriage.

259
00:12:14,227 --> 00:12:17,189
I'm not even sure what we
have can be called a marriage.

260
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,399
Real helpful, Beau.

261
00:12:19,483 --> 00:12:21,109
Actually, it's very helpful.

262
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:22,945
Very good, Beau.

263
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:25,155
He believes that you
two are not in a marriage.

264
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:28,992
Now, I encourage you both
to say how you're feeling.

265
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:31,244
I'm feeling like going home.

266
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,833
Beau, you agreed to come
here. At least give it a chance.

267
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,751
You say you're open to
things, but you're not.

268
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,628
You either shut down or complain.

269
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:42,840
Good. Wonderful. This is so great.

270
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:45,468
- Are you gonna keep doing that?
- Doing what?

271
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,470
Saying "good" every time we say

272
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:49,537
something bad about each other?

273
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:52,390
Let's try this.

274
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,059
Maggie...

275
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:56,156
when would you say things started

276
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,254
to go awry between the two of you?

277
00:12:58,772 --> 00:12:59,940
Well...

278
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:01,702
I know that once I bought the bar,

279
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:02,925
he started to resent me.

280
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,487
Are you serious?

281
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,280
Is that really why we came here?

282
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:10,784
To rehash stuff that we've
been fighting about for years?

283
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,661
[scoffs] Oh, we don't fight, Beau.

284
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,456
I bring something up, you shut me down,

285
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,105
and that's the end of the discussion.

286
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:18,291
That's not true.

287
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,752
End of discussion.

288
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:24,840
Okay, fine.

289
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,843
You wanna talk about
something new? Brenda Sanders.

290
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:29,344
Oh, here we go.

291
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:33,140
You gotta be kidding.

292
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:34,850
You're going to bring up Brenda here?

293
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,644
I told you, I didn't sleep with her.

294
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:39,021
Well, I had to walk around with
the whole town thinking you did.

295
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:41,690
- No one thought that.
- Oh, we all did.

296
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,902
You know what? I'm done.

297
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,280
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

298
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:57,414
Well, that was a good session.

299
00:13:57,497 --> 00:13:59,875
Priscilla, shut the fuck up.

300
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,337
Mornin'.

301
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,089
Hey, Rooster.

302
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:07,633
Thanks for taking
care of things last night.

303
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,218
Oh, I took care of things
last night, all right.

304
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,223
Wait, after all of that, you
still hooked up with her sister?

305
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:17,032
No, I did not. I did not, in fact,

306
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,585
hook up with Heather's sister.

307
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:19,645
[Rooster clears throat]

308
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:20,813
Mom?

309
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,316
No!

310
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:26,777
What are you doing here?

311
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,613
Uh... I'm sorry, sweetie. [grunts]

312
00:14:29,697 --> 00:14:31,699
I didn't plan for this to happen.

313
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:34,910
Colt, this is Mary, Heather's mom.

314
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:36,119
- Heather, Mary, uh...
- [chuckles]

315
00:14:36,203 --> 00:14:37,746
No introduction needed.

316
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,291
Uh, nice to... meet you.

317
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,963
I'm really surprised this
happened, given our conversation.

318
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,132
Yeah, I thought you took Darlene home.

319
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,300
Uh, yes, I did.

320
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:53,596
And taking her home on my
motorcycle was a bit of a mixed blessing.

321
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,088
The sound of the bike, you know,

322
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:56,873
kind of drowned out most of her tears.

323
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,060
But then I pulled up to this
light and had to explain to a cop

324
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:02,563
that I was not, in fact,
kidnapping her. So...

325
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,731
[Mary chuckles]

326
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:07,109
Yeah, he got Darlene
home safe and sound.

327
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:10,112
He was so sweet. He even
sang her baby a lullaby.

328
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:13,156
[chuckles] Yeah, Ozzy
Osbourne, "Crazy Train."

329
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,660
- Whoo-hoo. All aboard.
- [Mary chuckles]

330
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:20,581
And then we started talking.

331
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:23,834
Turns out, Mary has always
had the hots for the Rooster.

332
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,753
Oh, God... That is not what I said.

333
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:29,632
What I said was, "The Bennett
men are all very handsome."

334
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:31,759
- It's true.
- I bowl with your father.

335
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:34,845
Oh, great. Now my dad's hot.

336
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,682
He really is. [chuckles]

337
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:42,477
How would you like it if
I said your mom's hot?

338
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,062
Hey, back off.

339
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:47,858
We talked for hours.

340
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,484
You know, once you
get past "the Rooster,"

341
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:53,947
Jameson is a really
sweet, smart, sensitive guy.

342
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:56,574
[chuckles] You can't prove that.

343
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:00,495
[laughs] So I offered
him some wine, and...

344
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:02,956
we started talking about
our lives in Garrison,

345
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,801
and then one thing led
to another and then...

346
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,009
Yeah, we didn't want, you know,

347
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,568
Darlene to wake up and see us, 'cause...

348
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:10,297
[chuckles] that would be awkward.

349
00:16:13,591 --> 00:16:14,677
Yeah.

350
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,469
That would be awkward.

351
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:19,556
Well, it's a little hot in here.

352
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,601
[Rooster] Hmm.

353
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:25,979
Yeah, he gets hot flashes. He's
going through the change.

354
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:27,272
[Mary chuckles]

355
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:28,523
You know what, honey, um,

356
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:29,568
why don't you grab your coat

357
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:30,966
and I'll drop you at home before work?

358
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:32,027
Okay. [clears throat]

359
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,904
- Hey, where do you work?
- Cracker Barrel.

360
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,238
Oh, shit. Jackpot.

361
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:38,951
Get us a discount?

362
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:40,703
- You know I can.
- [Rooster chuckles]

363
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:43,496
I know this is a little
fast, but I think I love you.

364
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,665
[chuckles]

365
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,085
- I'll talk to you later.
- Bye, Rooster.

366
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:49,929
All right, Roth
girls, y'all have a good day.

367
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:52,214
[sighs]

368
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,590
Ooh.

369
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,093
Hey...

370
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:58,470
what did you do?

371
00:16:58,553 --> 00:16:59,826
Colt... it would be unsavory

372
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,622
to give you the details of the things

373
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,684
I did to your girlfriend's
mom last night.

374
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,065
You cannot date Heather's mom!

375
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:12,943
Are you intentionally
trying to fuck up my life?

376
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:14,987
You don't need my
help to fuck up your life.

377
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:17,865
[muttering] Who does that?

378
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:20,068
I mean, I was cool with
you going out with her sister,

379
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,869
but you don't bang the mom, dude.

380
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:24,621
Hey, I like the mom, dude.

381
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,332
No, you don't. That's bullshit.

382
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:29,042
You like any woman
standing in front of you.

383
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,961
You liked her
daughter earlier in the night.

384
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,505
Yeah, that's 'cause her daughter's hot.

385
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:36,008
But Mary's hot and cool, you know.

386
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:38,844
Like a sandwich with buffalo
sauce and ranch dressing.

387
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,140
It's my girlfriend's mom!

388
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:44,201
[stammers] You know,

389
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:46,375
you just don't care about
anybody, do you?

390
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:48,040
Look, man, I'm closer in age to her

391
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:49,670
than you are to Heather, all right?

392
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,243
You think about it, you're the weirdo

393
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:52,381
who's dating a 23-year-old.

394
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:57,195
No, you think about
it, you're an asshole.

395
00:17:58,196 --> 00:17:59,315
That is no way to speak

396
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,847
to your future father-in-law.

397
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:06,789
[thunder rumbling]

398
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:10,208
Your calves look healthy to me, Beau.

399
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:13,586
A good thing, too, because
I know if they didn't,

400
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,756
you wouldn't have the
money for me to fix 'em.

401
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,424
You know, I'd insult you back,

402
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:19,508
but I know you wouldn't
hear it 'cause you're deaf.

403
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:22,012
- What?
- I said, "Thanks for coming over."

404
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:24,765
Can I get you some coffee?

405
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:27,309
Coffee? No... [stammers]

406
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:30,145
Whiskey'd be good,
though. That Jim Beam looks fine.

407
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:33,106
Are you kidding? It's
10:30 in the morning.

408
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,984
I don't know. Phyllis Diller, I guess.

409
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,991
[thunder rumbling]

410
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:49,790
Some weather comin' in.

411
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,749
You feelin' it in your knee?

412
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,626
I see the clouds.

413
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,378
You blind, too?

414
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:58,491
No, but I wish I
was, then I wouldn't have

415
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:00,157
to look at your sour old puss.

416
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:02,970
- Here you go.
- Cheers.

417
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:06,556
I got somethin' I wanna ask you, Dale.

418
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,267
About as long as you're
pourin', I'm listenin'.

419
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:13,271
How have you and Charlene stayed
together for so long?

420
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:15,773
Well, part of it's love...

421
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,567
part of it's hard work.

422
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:19,830
Big part of it is when she starts

423
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:21,637
telling me about how her day is goin',

424
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:24,199
I... I turn my bad ear toward her...

425
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:29,371
and every once in a while say, "Yep.
Uh-huh. Sure sounds tough."

426
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:33,917
Well... Maggie and I
are havin' a hard time.

427
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:37,545
I don't even know what the
right thing to do is anymore.

428
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:40,590
Yep. Uh-huh. Sure sounds tough.

429
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,094
Damn it, Dale.

430
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,554
You know...

431
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:49,182
back in the ranch, I had two old horses.

432
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:51,434
[stammers] Both over 20 years old.

433
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:54,229
One of 'em was a mare, one
of 'em was a gelding.

434
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,106
And they were almost inseparable.

435
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:57,565
I remember those two.

436
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:00,152
- What?
- I said, "I remember those two."

437
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:03,571
Well, who cares if you do?
I'm telling the story here.

438
00:20:05,532 --> 00:20:09,036
Well, the mare kept
biting at the gelding's tail.

439
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,747
And the gelding kept stealing
carrots meant for her.

440
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,583
Then one day, she up and died.

441
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,377
Just old age.

442
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,548
Ten days later... the
gelding followed her.

443
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:24,885
Are you saying that horse
died of a broken heart?

444
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:27,845
Oh, hell no. It's the worst
case of colic I ever saw.

445
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,098
Probably from all 'em carrots he stole.

446
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:33,018
I had to put him down.

447
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:36,438
So, if Maggie dies, I
should avoid eating carrots?

448
00:20:37,397 --> 00:20:38,899
Look, all I'm saying is...

449
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,069
if we care for something...

450
00:20:42,152 --> 00:20:43,728
we sometimes have to put up

451
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:45,387
with things that annoy us.

452
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:47,615
Like you and me.

453
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:50,827
You know, I don't like you one bit.

454
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:53,538
Well, I don't care for you much, either.

455
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,791
And if you need to talk, let me know.

456
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:59,252
I'll charge you by the hour.

457
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:01,254
Yep. Uh-huh.

458
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:02,923
Sure sounds tough.

459
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,382
[laughs]

460
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,012
[exhales heavily]

461
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:11,681
Oh, hey, Colt.

462
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,850
Hey, Mrs. Roth.

463
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,865
Oh, come on, you can call me Mary.

464
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:17,378
I am fucking your brother.

465
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:20,190
[chuckles] Yeah, your
daughter and I are...

466
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,901
I can't say it.

467
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:28,240
Look, I know today was weird.

468
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:31,576
Yeah. [clears throat]
It's still kind of weird.

469
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:32,910
[sighs] Yeah.

470
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:34,212
When I was coming down those stairs

471
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:35,521
with my panties tucked into my purse,

472
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,916
I just thought, "Mary... [chuckles]
this is not your finest hour."

473
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:40,961
On the other hand...

474
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,587
how often do you get
to do the walk of shame

475
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,511
in front of your
daughter... and her boyfriend?

476
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:48,426
Huh? I mean, come on, that's
one for the highlight reel.

477
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:52,514
If you're tryin' to make this
less weird, it ain't working.

478
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,393
I know. You know, if I could
do last night over again,

479
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:57,727
I would do it differently.

480
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,522
You know? I would talk to Heather.

481
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:03,086
I would talk to you. I would
make sure y'all were okay with it.

482
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,069
But... honey, that's
not how it happened...

483
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:07,904
and here we are.

484
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,824
All right, look, if you
want to date a Bennett,

485
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:14,327
- I got a cousin who's a doctor...
- [chuckles]

486
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,953
I mean, it's true, he's a dent doctor.

487
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:17,664
He pulls out dents in cars, but...

488
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,250
I mean, still, it's better than Rooster.

489
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:23,045
Honey, look...

490
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:25,672
I had my first kid when I was 17.

491
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:27,697
[chuckles] I mean, it's only recently

492
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,408
I've gotten to live my own life.

493
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:32,554
I didn't really get to have my 20s.

494
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,307
So that's why you're dating Rooster,

495
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,950
you want to do something you'll regret?

496
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:38,435
[laughs]

497
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:40,187
You know what? That's funny.

498
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,646
That's exactly what I told Heather

499
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:43,490
when she told me she
was dating Colt Bennett.

500
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,402
All right. [chuckles softly] I get it.

501
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,030
Look, I'm... I'm sure moving forward...

502
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:54,284
things will get better.

503
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,786
[sighs] 'Sup, amigo?

504
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:01,166
Yeah, it ain't gettin' better.

505
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,543
Hey, Heather, your
little boyfriend's here.

506
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:09,091
You two don't stay out too late now.

507
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:11,634
Come on, babe, Shark
Tank is about to start.

508
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:18,057
You got a minute?

509
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:20,768
[sighs] You know what?

510
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:23,563
I'm done. Sound familiar?

511
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:25,565
It does.

512
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:31,446
Maggie, you annoy me.

513
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:35,074
Aw, thank you.

514
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:36,618
Other men bring flowers.

515
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:40,788
And I know that I annoy you.

516
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:43,895
But if this is gonna work, we're both

517
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,817
gonna have to put up with some stuff.

518
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:47,420
All right.

519
00:23:48,463 --> 00:23:50,215
I'm sorry about walking out...

520
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:53,260
when you brought up Brenda.

521
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,761
What do you want me to say?

522
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:56,638
I was lost.

523
00:23:58,055 --> 00:23:59,724
You'd just moved out.

524
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:02,477
I needed to get a haircut. She cut hair.

525
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:06,689
I was upset over you.

526
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:09,359
Her husband had just passed.

527
00:24:09,442 --> 00:24:10,818
We talked.

528
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:13,070
That's it.

529
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:15,657
I know all that.

530
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,825
I brought up Brenda to prove a point.

531
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:21,246
When things get
uncomfortable, you shut down.

532
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,123
And I'm afraid if I move
back into that house...

533
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,584
we're gonna go back to the
way we were before I left.

534
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:30,588
I'm not saying things
are gonna be perfect.

535
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:33,090
Oh, that was clear when
you told me I annoy you.

536
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,638
I'm a different person
than I was 15 years ago.

537
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:41,641
And I don't wanna go back
to the way it was, either.

538
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:44,227
Oh... glad to hear that.

539
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:48,606
I don't wanna lose you, Mags.

540
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:52,652
You know, in your whole
life, you only get...

541
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:55,655
one person who knows you best.

542
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,325
And that's you.

543
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,910
[sighs] Damn it, Beau.

544
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:04,205
When did you learn to
say all the right things?

545
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:07,875
I saw The Bridges of Madison County.

546
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:16,133
I think your mom is awesome.

547
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:18,887
It's just that Rooster's... not.

548
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,390
I don't want what's going
on with them to screw us up.

549
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,934
Fine, say they do break up.

550
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:26,686
Yeah, let's pray they break up.

551
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:29,314
[chuckles] No, who cares?

552
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,816
They got their thing and we got ours.

553
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:33,610
I like you.

554
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:37,822
Nothing's changin'
that, no matter what they do.

555
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,907
Give me a second.

556
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:42,577
Dear Lord, break 'em up.

557
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,537
Go, Broncos. Amen.

558
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:45,747
[Heather chuckles]

559
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,666
[sighs] Look, if you're okay
with this, I won't worry.

560
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,668
I might still kick my brother's ass...

561
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:52,545
- [chuckles]
- but we'll be fine.

562
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,715
- High school phenom, Colt Bennett.
- Oh, yeah.

563
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:56,883
Your table's ready.

564
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,094
Did you seriously put that as your name?

565
00:26:00,177 --> 00:26:02,221
You want a free
appetizer or not? [scoffs]

566
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:05,308
Yeah, well, we're already
getting my mom's discount.

567
00:26:05,392 --> 00:26:08,811
Yeah, well, I'm pretty
sure free is cheaper than 40%...

568
00:26:08,895 --> 00:26:10,730
- but I'm no mathmagician.
- [chuckles]

569
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,107
Hey, isn't that Kenny and Abby?

570
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,192
Oh, yeah, it is.

571
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:16,319
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

572
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:18,154
Hey, Colt. Hi, Heather.

573
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:21,198
Uh, oh, Kenny, your, uh,
napkin fell on your lap.

574
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:25,712
- So, how are you guys doing?
- [Kenny] Good.

575
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:27,497
Just celebrating our anniversary.

576
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,499
We had our first date
here five years ago.

577
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,584
Yeah, anyway, nice to see you two.

578
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:32,917
I'm sure you wanna get going

579
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,903
and enjoy a nice
dinner at your own table.

580
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:36,548
Easy, Ken Dog.

581
00:26:36,631 --> 00:26:38,425
I'm pretty sure this barrel's
big enough for the both of us.

582
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:39,592
[chuckles]

583
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:41,761
No, I'm sorry. I just meant
that it would be better if...

584
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,805
Oh, look at that. You
got the chocolate...

585
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:45,139
Fuck me.

586
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:51,354
Kenny, is that... Are you...

587
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:52,855
Sweetie... [sighs]

588
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:55,567
Uh, this isn't how I
planned it, but, uh...

589
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:02,699
Ah... [stammers] you are
smart, you're beautiful...

590
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:04,951
you're oddly competitive.

591
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,328
[chuckles]

592
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:07,442
You could have picked

593
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:09,480
anybody in the world, and you chose me.

594
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,920
I love you more than
anything in the world.

595
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:16,629
- [chuckles]
- Abby Phillips...

596
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,217
- [smacks lips] will you marry me?
- [gasps]

597
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,803
Yes. Of course.

598
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:25,054
[gasps]

599
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:28,975
[Abby laughs]

600
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,518
Oh, my God. Congratulations.

601
00:27:30,602 --> 00:27:32,854
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

602
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:34,563
Congrats. [clears throat]

603
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:40,277
[somber country music playing]
