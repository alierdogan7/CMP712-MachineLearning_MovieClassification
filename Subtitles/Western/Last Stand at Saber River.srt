2
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,900
Twisted bronc.
Like to break my back.

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,600
Rolling over on me.

4
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,400
I know that colt.

5
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,900
His daddy was a true outlaw too.

6
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
They're spooked tonight.

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Why do I always draw nighthawk
when it's a full moon?

8
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,300
You shoot every stranger in Texas...

9
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,300
...you're gonna be more famous
than Quantrill himself.

10
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,600
You look like you seen a ghost, Real.

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,900
Your wife got a letter saying you died.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,500
It was signed by the great
General Bedford Forrest himself.

13
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Word was that you died a hero
for the Confederacy.

14
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Well...

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,600
...truth be known,
I got shot in the butt.

16
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,700
And I don't remember feeling heroic,
General Forrest or not.

17
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
- Is the war over?
- For me it is.

18
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,000
You hungry?

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
How is she?

20
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,900
Seeing you is going to shake her.
You want me to settle the mustang?

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,500
This horse and I have come
a long way together.

22
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,300
Goodbye!

23
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,600
See you tomorrow!

24
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,900
Clare! Davis!

25
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,800
Wait a minute.

26
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,600
- Where you all going so fast?
- To go say goodbye to Sanders.

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Afterwards, get your chores done.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
- Yes, Mama.
- Yes, Mama.

29
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Clare, after chores,
help Davis with his arithmetic.

30
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,000
I will, Mama.

31
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,800
- Felt naked without my Colt.
- That's what britches are for.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't listen to him.
He's a mean old man.

33
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,700
We altered the hammer
and the cylinder...

34
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,400
...and we installed a side ejector rod
to punch out the empty shells.

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,200
- It doesn't feel much different.
- It might not...

36
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,900
...but that converted Colt is now
a custom-made precision firearm.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,500
- Not that you know how to use it.
- Yes, sir.

38
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,800
Those boys will wanna play
poker with you.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
No, ma'am. This gun stays
right where it is.

40
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,700
He has a mind for sums, but have him
practice his penmanship after chores.

41
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,000
Sarah, will you get my children?

42
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Well, I'll vow.

43
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,900
As there's a God in heaven.

44
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
- Hello, James.
- I'm glad you're back.

45
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,400
This is your father.

46
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,600
No, he's not. Cable's dead.
You said so.

47
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,300
I was wrong.

48
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
You're a big boy.

49
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,900
Wouldn't have known you, either.

50
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
- Daddy.
- Hello, Clare.

51
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Look at you.

52
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,500
Where's the baby?

53
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
Mary died.

54
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,500
Almost three years ago, of influenza.

55
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,000
There was nothing anybody
could've done.

56
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,700
Two days after she'd come down
with it...

57
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,500
...she was gone.

58
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,200
Three years ago?

59
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,500
I wrote you.

60
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,800
Half a dozen letters.

61
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
"There are old soldiers...

62
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
...and there are eager soldiers.

63
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,800
But, regretfully...

64
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,700
...there are very few
old eager soldiers."

65
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Were you eager?

66
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,700
Clare says you fought
Northern oppression.

67
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,500
I fought to stay alive, son.

68
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,300
Ask him why a grown man
with three children would volunteer.

69
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,900
That's like asking a man
why he's short or tall.

70
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,800
He just is, that's all.

71
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Mama used to say that the greatest
unanswered question of our time...

72
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,500
...was why you volunteered
for the Confederate Army.

73
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,800
You didn't have to go.

74
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
Out of the mouths of babes.

75
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,600
And we all know who put
those words in his mouth.

76
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,400
He enlisted because General Forrest
personally sent him a commission.

77
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,200
Your father trained the horses...

78
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Let's not talk about the great
General Forrest.

79
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,400
He's the greatest horse general
that ever lived.

80
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
- Man goes to war when his country calls.
- He went to war to get away from us.

81
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,100
He went to war for God
and country and horseflesh.

82
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,000
- He thought it'd be a great adventure.
- Since I'm not dead...

83
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,000
...it is no longer necessary
to talk about me as if I was.

84
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,900
Anyway, we're gonna win
because God's on our side.

85
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,700
I don't know where God stands, son,
but the war is lost.

86
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,900
That's enough talk about the war
for one night. Let's get to bed.

87
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Well, see you in the morning.

88
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

89
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,500
Well, that was an interesting evening.

90
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,000
My daughter's always had
a prickly disposition.

91
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
You know, too much education
is a terrible thing for a woman.

92
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,300
- James Sanford, I missed you.
- Welcome home, son.

93
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
What do you wanna do now?

94
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,500
Well, must be 20,000 head of cattle
all over south Texas.

95
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,300
Real wants me to help drive them
to Abilene.

96
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,700
Is that what you wanna do?

97
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,700
We need the money.

98
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
Your father's a real artist.

99
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,100
I did it, if you wanna know.

100
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,900
You didn't answer my question.

101
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,600
I wanna go home.

102
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,500
It's what I dreamed of.

103
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,400
This is the money we got for our cows
when we left Arizona.

104
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
It is.

105
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,600
You never touched it.

106
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
No.

107
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
What do you wanna do?

108
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,000
Every day, I got up at sunrise.

109
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,900
Every day, I taught school,
I came home, I cooked dinner...

110
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,200
...I read to the children,
I went to bed...

111
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,400
...and I waited for you to come back
and take me home.

112
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,700
Put this horse to work, couple of years
you'll have a great stable.

113
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Much obliged, James.

114
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,700
Arizona territory is still Union.

115
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,100
But with your eye,
this is good at 1000 yards.

116
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,600
The war is behind us, or so I thought.

117
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,400
Clare, we're moving out.

118
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,500
You'll come visit us in Arizona?

119
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,200
Daughter, you know
I'll never leave Texas.

120
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
What's the matter?

121
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,100
We've been talking. It's Sunday.
We wanna stop.

122
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,100
I figure three more hours.
Then we'll stop.

123
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,800
- Giddyup!
- Go!

124
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,700
Giddyup!

125
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,000
- Giddyup!
- That's it, Clare.

126
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,300
What's wrong with Daddy, Mama?

127
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,200
Nothing at all, Davis.

128
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,000
See those mountains up there?

129
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
When we clear them,
we'll be in Arizona territory.

130
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,300
Giddyup!

131
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,200
We're almost home.

132
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,500
Y'all hush and get to sleep.

133
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,700
They're so excited about getting home.

134
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,800
There were times, even on the
battlefield, I used to think about Mary.

135
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,600
Trying to imagine what she looked like.

136
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,500
I saw her when she was 2.

137
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,600
I saw her on her third birthday.

138
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,800
When she was 4...

139
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,400
Barely lived past 1.

140
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,500
Stampede.

141
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,200
Come on, Davis! Come on.

142
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,000
- Everybody all right?
- I think so.

143
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,700
Whoa! There's folks up here.

144
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,400
Stay back.

145
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,600
- Didn't expect anybody'd be up this high.
- We had a fire.

146
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,600
- We couldn't have stopped them anyway.
- Lightning spooked them.

147
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,600
You had no right driving horses at night
in a storm. Any fool knows that.

148
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,900
Austin, go get Vern and my father.

149
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,800
Joe, Ben, get the wagon up.

150
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,200
Most folks use the wagon trail
down below.

151
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,000
We figured it'd be safer up here.

152
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,900
- What's your name?
- Cable. What's yours?

153
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,200
Keep quiet.

154
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,300
Lorraine Kidston's my name.
Where you folks headed?

155
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,300
Didn't say.

156
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,600
She's from Philadelphia. I don't expect
her to know, but you boys...

157
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,100
Running horses down a mountain,
in the dark, in a storm?

158
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,900
Mama told them that.

159
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,200
I'll bet she did.

160
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
What did you say your name was?

161
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,000
Didn't say.

162
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,600
His name's Cable. The girl said so.

163
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600
They said you were dead.

164
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,300
Wishful thinking for some.

165
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,300
You rode with that murderous
son of a bitch, Nathan Bedford Forrest.

166
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,400
After the war, we're gonna hang him.

167
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,900
You're gonna need a long rope.

168
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,700
We could shoot you right here.
Probably get a medal for it.

169
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,900
Bunch of Yankees murdering one man,
his wife and children?

170
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,200
They give medals for that in your army?

171
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Ma'am, your home has been confiscated
by the Union Army.

172
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,600
- That's stealing!
- Clare.

173
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
Arizona never was a slave territory.

174
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,700
- Didn't fight for slavery.
- What the hell did you fight for?

175
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,400
When you betrayed the Union,
gave up your rights.

176
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,400
You folks should move on.
Save a lot of heartbreak.

177
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,700
Nobody's driving us off our land.

178
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,000
You figure you can drop us all?

179
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
You're first. He's next.

180
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,600
You care what happens after that?

181
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
You don't belong here.

182
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Maybe you did once...

183
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,500
...but not now.

184
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
Giddyup!

185
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Looking for John Denaman.

186
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,100
Well, he's not here anymore.

187
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,900
- What about Luz or Manuel?
- You know Luz?

188
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,600
Since she was 7 years old.

189
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,200
- What's your name?
- What happened to Denaman?

190
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,500
Nothing. He just died.

191
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,200
You're not dead!

192
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
No, Luz, just a little tired, that's all.

193
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,000
- Martha.
- Hi, Luz!

194
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,700
Clare!

195
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,000
You're gonna be as tall as your pa!

196
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
My God.

197
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,800
- I bet Davis doesn't remember me at all.
- I do too!

198
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,300
Okay, let's see if we can find
something sweet inside.

199
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,100
You wouldn't be Cable, would you?

200
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,500
Word was you got yourself dead
at Bryce's Crossroads.

201
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,300
Used to be nobody gave
two nickels about me.

202
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,900
I'll buy you a drink.
Name's Janroe.

203
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,700
I want you to know...

204
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,900
...you've got a friend
in Edward Janroe.

205
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,200
That's neighborly of you.

206
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,300
Thank you, Luz.

207
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,300
I may be the only friend
you got around here.

208
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
Nobody knows I fought
with Kirby-Smith.

209
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,100
Maybe it's nobody's business.

210
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,100
I lost the use of this arm
outside of Richmond.

211
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,100
- That should be of interest to you.
- Why's that?

212
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,900
Because we're comrades-in-arms.
I mean, good God, man, I can help you.

213
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Because the Kidstons...

214
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
...are gonna kill you.

215
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,300
I don't need any help.

216
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,600
So Cable just rode up one sunny day
with no warning?

217
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,500
He caught my attention.

218
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,200
Who is this man Janroe?

219
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,900
Says he's Denaman's cousin.

220
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,900
Mr. Denaman left half the store to him
and half to Manuel and me.

221
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,300
How is your brother?

222
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,700
Manuel is fine.

223
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,400
- There are some men living in your house.
- Then they're gonna have to move out.

224
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,700
You know, the Union Army
is the only law around here.

225
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Then the Yankee cavalry's gonna line up
with the ranchers supplying them...

226
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,400
...with the remounts, don't you think?

227
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,200
Yeah, I think that could be right.

228
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,900
Thanks for the drink.

229
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,800
You folks need anything, I'm here.

230
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,300
Luz...

231
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,300
Take care.

232
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,100
Did Luz say where Manuel was?

233
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,100
Only that he was coming back
from Mexico tonight with supplies.

234
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,200
This is our valley.

235
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,500
Here, hold these.

236
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,300
About 30 head, and two men with them.

237
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,700
Got a plan?

238
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,500
Well, son, I'm just gonna knock on
the front door and tell them we're home.

239
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,000
Can I look?

240
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,400
Not now.

241
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,500
Any problems?

242
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,600
Any problems?

243
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,400
They want two crates next time.

244
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,000
Ambition's gonna kill that Mexican.

245
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,500
No!

246
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,000
I said, no!

247
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,100
Go away!

248
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,600
- I don't like you.
- I'll give you a dollar.

249
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,100
A dollar don't give you the right
to hurt me.

250
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,700
Get off her.

251
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Name's Cable, and this is my home.

252
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,700
Duane... He told us you was coming.

253
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,300
- Get your things and get out.
- That...

254
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,600
That don't seem sociable.

255
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,400
Duane said if we had
nothing else to do...

256
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,200
...we could kill you.

257
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
That'd be a mistake to try.

258
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,100
You think about it, son...

259
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,800
...before you pull on that hog leg.

260
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,600
Come on, Carlita.

261
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,100
I ain't armed!

262
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
- Mama!
- Stay back!

263
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,300
I got him!

264
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,400
- What's Vern gonna say?
- Tell him how it happened.

265
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,800
He'll understand. Tomorrow morning,
I'll drive your stock over to your spread.

266
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,300
You'd best not be coming back
here again.

267
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
Yes, sir.

268
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,300
- Where's Mama?
- She's down by the water. She's fine.

269
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,200
Now go back inside like I told you.

270
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
Martha...

271
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,600
You knew they were gonna
try to kill you.

272
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,700
I figured they might.

273
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,300
You became a killer, and now I'm one.

274
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,300
- Did you have a choice?
- Do I have one now?

275
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,900
You haven't stopped snarling
since I come home.

276
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Well, you're not the man I married.

277
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,100
I am not the only soldier
who served in a losing cause...

278
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,500
...and you are not the only woman
to lose a child.

279
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,300
You think that's what this is about?

280
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,100
They're asleep.

281
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,100
Think they're gonna be back tonight?

282
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,800
No, I don't.

283
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,500
I had a dream about the day
you asked me to marry you.

284
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,000
- You asked me.
- I said it was a dream.

285
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,400
Daddy said I was too old...

286
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,400
...too skinny and too mean.

287
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,300
You said:

288
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,400
"Gonna trade some horses
down in Mexico. Wanna go along?"

289
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,100
I took that as a proposal.

290
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
You remember when...

291
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,700
...Sonny West gave me
a good shellacking...

292
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,400
...and you gave him a black eye...

293
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,700
...and you knocked out his front tooth?
You went to his father, and you said:

294
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,400
"Cable's got no ma. He's got no granny.
And if Sonny ever touches him again...

295
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,500
...I'm gonna shoot him dead."

296
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Tonight I shot two people dead.

297
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's just the wind.

298
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,900
Pride and Prejudice.

299
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,600
Luxuries we can't afford.

300
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,000
I never read a book in my life.

301
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,900
I couldn't even write my own name
till you taught me.

302
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,200
You're smart enough.

303
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,900
Martha...

304
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,200
...an army of Rebs are coming home.

305
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,700
Are they all strangers like us?

306
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,800
I know one thing.

307
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,200
I don't wanna live with a woman
who don't like me.

308
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,300
Think on it.

309
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,700
If that's the way it is...

310
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,000
...I'll take you back to Texas.

311
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,900
I tried to remember everything
you taught me.

312
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,600
You remembered what I taught you
and more.

313
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,600
Sorry I missed it.

314
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,000
But I'm real proud of you, daughter.

315
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,600
Settle down.

316
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,300
- Move it, boy.
- They're coming round.

317
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,600
We'll reach Fort Lowell
by noon tomorrow.

318
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,300
Isn't that Bill Dancy?

319
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,900
Nobody rides that hard with good news.

320
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,000
Is it Apaches? It certainly ain't payday.

321
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,900
They're dead, Mr. Kidston.

322
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,800
Royce and Joe Bob got blowed to hell.
Come here as quick as I could.

323
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
- What happened?
- Well, we was drinking.

324
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,900
And having a good time.

325
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,600
And Joe Bob, he got a little rough
with Carlita. And then Cable showed up.

326
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,200
You were drunk.

327
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,300
I can smell it from here.

328
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,100
Well, then Joe Bob, he sort of tore
Carlita's dress.

329
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,100
So Cable shows up and shoots
both of them...

330
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,000
...because Joe Bob tore
some whore's dress.

331
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,600
Well, I don't remember everything.
I did have a few drinks.

332
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,400
Think on it, Bill.

333
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,200
Then Cable told us to get out.

334
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
- And then what?
- Well, they drew iron, that's what.

335
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,300
That's when the woman come out with
a scattergun and unloaded both barrels.

336
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,400
You mean Cable's wife
shot Royce and Joe Bob?

337
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,100
- Yes, sir.
- Two drunks trying...

338
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,600
...to murder her husband.
I can't say I'm surprised.

339
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,300
Lorraine.

340
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,800
Why didn't he kill you?

341
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,600
Because I didn't have my gun.

342
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
We gotta do something, Mr. Kidston.

343
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,900
Oh, I'm gonna do something.

344
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,200
Tomorrow I'm gonna sell these mustangs
at Fort Lowell.

345
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,400
And then I'm gonna take a bath,
eat a steak and smoke a cigar.

346
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
Austin was right.

347
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,800
Do you wanna just bushwhack Cable
or murder his family?

348
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,400
To me, it's six of one,
half a dozen for the other.

349
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,000
- "And Enosh lived..."
- It's Enoch.

350
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,800
"And Enoch lived 90 years and...

351
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,400
...begat Canaan. And Enoch lived...

352
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,200
...after he begat Canaan...

353
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,200
...815 years and begat sons...

354
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,000
...and daughters."
- That's wonderful.

355
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,700
What's "begat" mean, Mama?

356
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,400
- It means "fathered."
- Nobody lives 815 years.

357
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,800
It's just a story, honey.

358
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,200
- How many heifers are you gonna buy?
- Daddy's gonna buy 1000 head.

359
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,700
More like 50, but I like your confidence.

360
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,600
We don't have enough grass
for 1000 head.

361
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,400
Fifty head's a good start.

362
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Can't I have my supper without hearing
a plot to commit murder?

363
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,900
He's gotta pay for what he done.

364
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,900
Who would've thought one ex-soldier
would be such an obstacle.

365
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,500
Well, Cable was a hard twist.

366
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,400
His war is lost.

367
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,600
All he's got is his place and his family.

368
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,200
His wife leaving him
might take the starch right out of him.

369
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,200
You learn to fight dirty
at that fancy school in Philadelphia?

370
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,800
From Duane.

371
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,900
What's the difference between
caliber and gauge?

372
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,100
The caliber is the size of the bore.

373
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,100
It's the diameter of the inside
of the barrel expressed in inches.

374
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,700
For instance, the Sharps
is a.52 caliber.

375
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,200
- So it's 52 one-hundredths of an inch?
- Exactly.

376
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,400
Morning, Mrs. Cable.

377
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,000
Mr. Janroe.

378
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,200
Just thought you must be running low
on sugar and coffee about now.

379
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
So we thought we'd come on over.

380
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,600
- Where's your husband?
- Around the side of the house.

381
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,700
What did you bring us, Miss Luz?

382
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,500
- Hi, Miss Luz.
- Hi.

383
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,000
Mr. Cable.

384
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,000
Luz tells me that you sold your stock
down in Mexico before you pulled out.

385
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,100
- And I'm fixing to buy them back.
- Well, good.

386
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,600
I'm glad you're able to do that.
Cable, listen.

387
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,300
I'm sure you're wondering about
my interest in your affairs yesterday.

388
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,700
Well, I seem to be sort of...

389
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,900
...the prize bull
around these parts lately.

390
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,400
Yeah, well, there was a purpose.

391
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,400
Did you know Denaman was running
guns for the South?

392
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,200
Confederate agents bring them across
the border where we pick them up.

393
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,600
The store is just a relay point.
And we ship them back east.

394
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,200
And where do you fit in?

395
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,300
I'm the chief agent
for Arizona Territory.

396
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,300
Well, that ought to keep you busy.

397
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,400
- Mr. Cable, let me get right to the point.
- That would be good.

398
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,400
Your country needs you.
You're still a Confederate soldier.

399
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
If I still believed in this war,
which I don't...

400
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,300
...I wouldn't have nothing to do
with running guns.

401
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,200
What do you mean, if you believe?

402
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,700
The war's over. Lee's beat six ways
from Dixie. And he knows it.

403
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,900
Even if you don't.

404
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,200
Daddy! The mare's down.
Down by the rocks in the creek.

405
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,900
Go get your ma.

406
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Mama, come quick.
Daddy needs your help.

407
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,300
The mare's down.
Come on, I'll show you.

408
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,500
Get back.

409
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,400
Hello, Cable.

410
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,900
You wanna lose that?

411
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,500
We figured you'd come sooner or later.

412
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,200
- What do you want?
- Justice. And we're gonna find it.

413
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,500
At the long end of a rope.

414
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
You killed our brother.

415
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,000
But it ain't polite to hang a lady.

416
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,600
So we're gonna
hang your husband instead.

417
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,800
Get out of here.

418
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,800
Go on, get out of here.

419
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Look out, Austin.

420
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,000
No, no, no.

421
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,200
Get up.

422
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,600
Don't shoot me, Wynn.

423
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Wynn!

424
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,700
Is he dead?

425
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,200
- I hope so.
- You gonna shoot this one?

426
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,200
Clare, take your brother back
to the house. Now. Go on, Davis.

427
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,900
In the morning...

428
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,500
...I'll take you in to Denaman's.
You'll be safe there.

429
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,600
And when the dust clears,
I'll put you on a stage to El Paso.

430
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,700
When the dust clears...

431
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,300
...you're gonna be just like him.

432
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,800
I'll take my chances.

433
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,500
It ain't up to you.

434
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,100
Mr. Janroe...

435
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,800
...I could use some help.

436
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,700
We had a little problem yesterday.

437
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,900
I'd appreciate it if my family
could stay here a few days.

438
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Happy to oblige.

439
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,600
I'd like to show you something.

440
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,700
- I don't see why we can't stay together.
- Till Daddy kills the blue-bellies...

441
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,700
...it won't be safe.
- Clare!

442
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,600
No, no, listen to me, Cable.

443
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,000
These rifles are more important
than any man's life.

444
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,500
I admire your sense of purpose. I do.

445
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,100
But if you figure a few British rifles are
gonna change the outcome of the war...

446
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,400
We're talking about your country here,
Mr. Cable.

447
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,900
Don't you still hear the guns?

448
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,900
The screams of the wounded?

449
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,700
You swore an oath to
the Confederate States of America.

450
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,700
It's your duty to kill Vern and Duane.

451
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,100
A soldier's oath doesn't include murder.

452
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,200
Isn't that what war is? It's murder.

453
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,400
All wrapped up and sanctified
with a flag.

454
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,400
You were at Fort Pillow.

455
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,000
Fort Pillow wasn't war.

456
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,900
It was an execution.

457
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,100
Forrest is a butcher in a black coat.

458
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,900
Mr. Janroe...

459
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,900
...all I can do for myself and my family
is try to rebuild our lives together.

460
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,800
And I suggest you do the same.

461
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,700
You know, the Dodd brothers...

462
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,500
...will never forget
that you killed Joe Bob.

463
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,400
There's only one Dodd left.

464
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,600
That's why you brought
your family here.

465
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,600
I couldn't get a fix on that.

466
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,000
Well, you know, it seems to me...

467
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,400
...that you're serving your country.

468
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,600
Whether you want to or not.

469
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,600
I'd consider it my duty
to look after your family.

470
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,900
I'm gonna hold you to that.

471
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,400
I ain't seen Wynn and Austin
since the drive to Fort Lowell.

472
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,100
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen them either.

473
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,500
Think they tried to settle
the score with Cable?

474
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,100
Damn it, you're supposed
to be looking after things.

475
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,900
Hell, they're grown men.
I don't have a rope on them.

476
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,100
If they went looking for trouble,
I suspect they found it.

477
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,700
If you had done as I suggested
and got rid of Cable...

478
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,600
...we wouldn't be having
all these problems.

479
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,600
You figure those horses were gonna
get to Fort Lowell by themselves.

480
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,400
This is business. If we don't run it like a
business, we're gonna be out of business.

481
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,700
This war ain't gonna last forever.
Contrary to what you think.

482
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,500
You must be hungry.

483
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,500
- I don't figure you.
- It ain't hard.

484
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,800
Just wanna be left alone.

485
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,700
I got work to do.

486
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,500
You best be gone when I get back.

487
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,300
Want some coffee?

488
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,300
It's fresh.

489
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,500
Relax.

490
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,400
- I'm alone.
- You walk?

491
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,500
I was thrown. My horse ran away.

492
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,800
That was careless, wasn't it?

493
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,300
The way you're walking,
it must have been a nasty fall.

494
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,200
I'll probably be black and blue tomorrow.

495
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,600
- You want me to saddle up a mustang?
- It can wait till morning.

496
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,700
Now, what would your father
say about that?

497
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,700
You afraid of my father, Mr. Cable?
Or me?

498
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,800
Or yourself?

499
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,800
Mr. Janroe didn't do anything wrong,
did he? I mean, you share the same bed.

500
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,400
He's not really interested.

501
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,100
He pretends, but he isn't.

502
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,200
He's so filled with hate,
there's no room for a woman.

503
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,800
He's not the only one around here.

504
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,400
This here is an old Yankee newspaper
from Fort Lowell.

505
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,600
You husband served with
General Forrest, didn't he?

506
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:55,100
Did he ever bring up the incident
at Fort Pillow, Tennessee?

507
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,000
He doesn't talk about the war.
I don't ask him.

508
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,800
There was some controversy.

509
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,400
Mr. Janroe, why don't you just go ahead
and say it. Whatever's on your mind.

510
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,900
"General Nathan Bedford Forrest
stands accused...

511
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
...of executing 300 Union prisoners."

512
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,900
And most of them niggers.

513
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,900
War changed your husband, didn't it?

514
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,000
It does all soldiers.

515
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,000
I mean, I'm not making any judgment.

516
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,000
But it's a fact.
See, after a spell, killing...

517
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,800
...gets easier, almost second nature.

518
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,100
Why are you telling me this?

519
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,600
We're involved in a vital conflict
right here.

520
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,900
Your husband has to answer
to his true nature.

521
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,600
His country needs him.

522
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,600
- You're wrong.
- How so?

523
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,200
My husband's a decent man. He's not
a murderer. In or out of uniform.

524
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,700
Everything was fine
until my mother died.

525
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,500
Next thing you know, I'm living
in Washington with Duane.

526
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,700
It wasn't so bad when he was off
campaigning. I got to do what I wanted.

527
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,500
You like to do what you want,
don't you?

528
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,400
Doesn't everybody?

529
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,100
Some people do what they have to.

530
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,600
Well, when Duane got thrown out
of the army and came out here...

531
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,600
...I had to come with him.

532
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,700
Now if he got thrown out of the army,
why does he still wear the uniform?

533
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,900
Because he thinks he's General Grant.

534
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,000
What did your father do?

535
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,300
He was a mustanger, same as me.

536
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,200
And his father?

537
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,500
Same.

538
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,700
And your son, is he gonna be
a mustanger too?

539
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,300
Davis?

540
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,400
Nope, he's gonna get an education.

541
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,600
He's gonna make a living
with his head, not his back.

542
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,700
Martha will see to that.

543
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,100
Want some more coffee?

544
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,400
I got a question for you.

545
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,200
- Ask it.
- What happened to your limp?

546
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,800
You're bored.
You're looking for trouble.

547
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,600
I took a bath last night.

548
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,100
I know you like me.

549
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,200
Sure, I like you.

550
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,200
But it don't make it right.

551
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,500
Later on tonight, you'll be sorry.

552
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,600
I'm already sorry.

553
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,600
Morning.

554
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,200
Send Lorraine on out here.

555
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,000
You're pretty free and easy
with my daughter's reputation.

556
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,600
Mr. Cable was a perfect gentleman.

557
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,900
My honor's intact.

558
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,200
Unfortunately.

559
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,800
In any event, a gun battle to reclaim
my reputation would be gratuitous.

560
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,600
Get on.

561
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,700
But I've made a very nice breakfast.

562
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,300
Lorraine.

563
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,600
You got two days to move on.

564
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,200
You keep your stock off my land.
I got cattle coming in.

565
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,600
Well, if that's the case...

566
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,400
...I'll kill you myself.

567
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,000
Thanks for the very nice breakfast.

568
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,600
Look at this.

569
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,400
It's over!

570
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It's over.

571
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
- What you talking about?
- What's over?

572
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,900
The war. The war's over.

573
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,100
In Hidalgo, everybody knows.

574
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,600
- It's on the front page.
- This is a lie.

575
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,600
- They told me to come tell you.
- How can they be sure?

576
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,000
- The telegraph doesn't lie.
- Who put you up to this?

577
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,600
Mr. Janroe!

578
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,400
Wars don't just end like this.

579
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,600
How do they end?

580
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,200
There's some warning.
Days, weeks before they end.

581
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,000
This is Arizona Territory.
We're not in Richmond.

582
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,200
This could be a Yankee trick.
Anybody can send a wire.

583
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,600
For what gain?

584
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,600
Luz, can I take your horse?

585
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,900
No, no. I'll tell Cable.

586
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,600
I'm going out that way anyway.

587
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

588
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,800
- This is good news, Mama.
- Who won?

589
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,200
For a man with a price on his head,
you're a bit careless, Cable.

590
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,000
I could've shot you back around
the bend. Your horse threw a shoe.

591
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,200
A blind man could find you in the dark.

592
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,300
Vern Kidston ain't gonna like you
running his horses.

593
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,200
- I'll need the grass.
- For what?

594
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,500
I see no overalls. You ain't no farmer.

595
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,600
I don't see no cattle.

596
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,000
Well, you will.

597
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,400
When you ride down to Nogales
and buy them.

598
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,600
Maybe Kidston will kill you
before I return.

599
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,400
Then sell the cattle and give
the money to Martha.

600
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,600
Maybe I keep the money.

601
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,800
Then enjoy yourself.

602
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,000
Cable?

603
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,200
Cable?

604
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,300
Cable!

605
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:42,900
It's over.

606
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,600
Maybe the Kidstons won't be
so angry anymore. You can stay.

607
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Maybe Janroe will go back
to where he came from.

608
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,500
Looks like my husband's gold.

609
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,100
This...

610
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,500
This is not gold.

611
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,400
This is some cows and a young bull who
knows how to take care of business.

612
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,400
Is he all right?

613
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,500
Cable? He's all right.

614
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,400
Cable is always all right.

615
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,300
Evening, major.

616
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,200
- Who's there?
- Edward Janroe.

617
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Didn't mean to startle you.

618
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,300
You didn't startle me.

619
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,300
You all alone here?

620
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,400
My daughter's sleeping in the house.

621
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,100
I suppose you've heard the news.

622
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,100
It's only gossip.

623
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,600
Nope. No, sir.

624
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,900
"Robert E. Lee surrendered the army
of Virginia to General Grant."

625
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,700
That is not gossip. That is fact.

626
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,600
Facts have a way of changing,
depending on who's issuing them.

627
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:59,200
The smoke and smell of Chancellorsville
are in my heart tonight.

628
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,200
I drink to all those brave men
who died there.

629
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,200
You'd understand, if you'd served.

630
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,400
I didn't lose the use of this arm
falling off a barstool.

631
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,000
I fought with Kirby-Smith.

632
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,800
You and Cable.

633
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,200
Well, you may have been
a soldier once...

634
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,300
...but you're just a grocery clerk now.

635
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,200
Underneath the store,
I got two dozen cases of Enfields.

636
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,500
Sir, I advise you to turn them in...

637
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,200
...to the authorities at Fort Lowell,
or face arrest.

638
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,500
Nobody's gonna arrest me, because
nobody knows about them rifles...

639
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,800
...except you.

640
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,300
Give it up, Janroe.

641
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,300
Go on home.

642
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,200
See, I don't believe you understand.

643
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,300
I understand I am talking to a man...

644
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,700
...who is not in complete control
of his faculties.

645
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,500
People gonna think Cable shot you,
for wrecking his house.

646
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,300
That's for General Sherman.

647
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,600
That's for Mr. Lincoln.

648
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,300
I'm sorry about your father.

649
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,000
We know who did it?

650
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,800
I was sleeping. I heard two shots.

651
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,400
By the time I got to him,
no one was there.

652
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,700
Who would it be if it wasn't Cable?

653
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,500
Who else had any reason?

654
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,200
Cable might have done it,
but it seems like we ought to be sure.

655
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
And we're not sure. That's the thing.

656
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,800
I'm sure as I need to be.

657
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,400
Mr. Kidston, I don't believe
Cable killed Duane.

658
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,800
Cable killed both my brothers,
but they were fair fights.

659
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,400
He could have killed me, and nobody
would've said "by your leave."

660
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,400
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion.

661
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,700
I had two brothers. Now I got none.

662
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,800
I got a mother in Kansas.

663
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,300
Well, you're a good hand, Austin.

664
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,100
Thank you.

665
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,300
This morning Mr. Kidston and three riders
headed out to your place.

666
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,000
It wasn't social.

667
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,400
Why?

668
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:57,000
Some fellow rode up to the house last
night and pumped two slugs into Duane.

669
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,500
Killed him for sure.

670
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Vern believes Cable did it.

671
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,300
How come you're not with them?

672
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,700
There's something wrong
with this valley.

673
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,100
The war's over,
but the killing don't stop.

674
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,800
- Luz?
- Don't worry.

675
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,200
I'll take care of the children.

676
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,000
Going out there's gonna make matters
worse. You'll get yourself shot.

677
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,300
I'll kill you if I have to.

678
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,100
You never told Cable the war's over.

679
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,500
He wasn't there.

680
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,700
Who killed Duane Kidston?

681
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,600
It was you.

682
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
We have work to do.

683
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,400
Hello, the house!

684
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,300
Sorry I missed you last night.

685
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,200
Put the gun down.

686
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,100
You tore up my house.

687
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,600
Put it down.

688
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,100
When you get off my land.

689
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,400
There's still law in this territory.

690
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,000
If you wanna come along peacefully,
I give you my word we won't shoot.

691
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,100
I got no business at Fort Lowell.

692
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,100
Well, you visited Duane last night.

693
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,300
We're returning the call.

694
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,500
I never left here last night.

695
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,800
You killed Duane. Shot him twice.

696
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,800
If I did, I'd remember.

697
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,400
You liar!

698
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,000
Vern!

699
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,200
Vern!

700
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,400
I could kill you anytime.

701
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,000
I could've killed you
yesterday with Manuel.

702
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,600
Why didn't you?

703
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,800
I'm not sure.

704
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,100
If my husband killed your brother,
he'd tell you straight out.

705
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,800
He knew the war was over.
He killed Duane anyway.

706
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,600
Is that true?

707
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,300
Nobody told me the war is over.

708
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,400
Janroe rode out here yesterday
to tell you.

709
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,800
Janroe came here?

710
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,800
I guess he paid us both a visit.

711
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,600
The children are at the store.

712
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,200
Janroe's there.

713
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Clare? Davis?

714
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,200
- Where's Janroe?
- Ain't nobody seen him.

715
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,900
He was gone when I got here.

716
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,400
Clare? Davis?

717
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,900
Mama!

718
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,700
Davis, where's your sister?

719
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,300
He took her.

720
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,000
Did Janroe shoot Luz?

721
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,400
Luz said he wasn't taking us anywhere.

722
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,500
Mr. Janroe shot her dead.

723
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,200
The rifles.

724
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,500
The wagon's gone.

725
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,800
He took the Enfields. All of them.

726
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:02,300
He needs Clare to help with the four-up.

727
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,700
- Rebs use San Pablo for trading.
- He'll sell the rifles there.

728
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,600
I'm going with you.

729
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,300
Duane's dead.

730
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,400
Your girl's alive. I'm going with you.

731
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,800
Go.

732
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,100
You go inside, okay?

733
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,900
I can't lose another child.

734
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,700
Four-up. Deep grooves.

735
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,700
Gotta be him.

736
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,800
You're gonna kill these horses.

737
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,200
Better them than me.

738
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,400
He's got three riders with him.

739
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,100
Cable, we're gonna
get your daughter back.

740
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,000
Daddy!

741
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,200
Undo the lines, Clare!

742
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,200
Daddy!

743
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,400
- Jump, darling!
- I can't!

744
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,600
Clare, I said, jump!

745
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,800
Jump!

746
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,300
We've got company.

747
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,200
Will you take my daughter...

748
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,600
...back to her mother?

749
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,800
- Yeah.
- I wanna stay with you!

750
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,900
Hey, hombre!

751
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Here's the deal.

752
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,100
You take the rifles and leave.

753
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,200
Let's end this.

754
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,100
No, no, no. You kill our friend.

755
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,700
Hombre, I think that we kill you.

756
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,900
Then we take the rifles.

757
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,400
That is the deal.

758
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:17,600
Oh, well.

759
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,000
Hombre!

760
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,300
Hombre!

761
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,400
We will take the rifles.

762
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,900
Don't shoot no more!

763
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,200
- Your daddy told me to get you home.
- I'm not going!

764
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,400
Clare?

765
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,200
Daddy!

766
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,700
Daddy, you're hurt.

767
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,600
I'm fine, darling.

768
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,300
Get on.

769
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,700
She wasn't going nowhere
till you showed.

770
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,800
Vern...

771
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,000
...I'll always be grateful
for what you done.

772
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,600
Well, I made more than my share
of mistakes.

773
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,100
Glad it worked out.

774
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,600
How bad is that?

775
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,400
Let's go.

776
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,900
- Mama!
- Oh, Clare!

777
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,800
Are you all right?

778
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,500
I'm all right.

779
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,500
But Daddy's hurt.

780
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,000
Thanks for helping my dad.

781
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,800
Glad I could, son.

782
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,300
Clare said you and Mr. Kidston
could've put Sir Lancelot to shame.

783
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,200
What spread's he work for?

784
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,500
We all owe Vern.

785
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,200
Maybe we can all live here
in peace now.

786
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:41,000
You talking about the war between
the states, or the war between us?

787
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,100
The disadvantage
of knowing a man all his life...

788
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,400
...is a woman never
expects him to change.

789
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,800
And when he does, it rattles her.

790
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:58,800
I can't remember when
the Cable you knew died.

791
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,800
Tell me about Fort Pillow.

792
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,400
All men sin.

793
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,800
Especially in war.

794
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,400
But we slaughtered unarmed prisoners.

795
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,400
They wore Yankee blue,
and we gunned them down like dogs.

796
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,400
You didn't shoot unarmed men.

797
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,500
No.

798
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,200
But l...

799
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,600
I couldn't do anything to stop it.

800
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,600
Mary died, and I couldn't do anything
to stop it.

801
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,600
We don't control our lives.

802
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,900
We pretend we do.

803
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,400
But it's self-deception.

804
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,900
With all my strength I reached out
for my child, but she slipped away.

805
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,200
So I blamed myself.

806
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,100
And when that wore out, I blamed you.

807
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:21,400
If there wasn't a war and you were beside
Mary's bed, she still would have died.

808
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,100
I don't know why I went to war.

809
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,100
Maybe I'll never know.

810
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,800
But I do know this:

811
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:41,400
There wasn't a day gone by I did not
regret leaving you and the children.

812
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,200
And it's important to me
that you know that.

813
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,200
It's important to me that you said it.

814
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,700
So where's that leave us?

815
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,000
We let the war and Mary sleep.

816
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,900
And nature can do the rest.
