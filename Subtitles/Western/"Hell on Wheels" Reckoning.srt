00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,110
Yes.

186
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:31,347
You are in a position to be magnanimous.

187
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:34,066
Well, he assaulted a federal marshal.

188
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:36,068
A rash act in the heat of the moment.

189
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,904
He'd be shot for that
offense in some states.

190
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:41,123
Well, let’s be grateful Wyoming

191
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:45,127
has not yet achieved statehood. [Laughs]

192
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,831
The mayor stays in jail.

193
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:57,006
Thank you for the cigars.

194
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,649
Hello?

195
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,200
Mrs. Bohannon.

196
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:28,671
I'm Ruth Cole.

197
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,958
- The church lady.
- Yes.

198
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,512
I wanted to apologize for
my behavior this morning.

199
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:40,299
It was unkind.

200
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,885
I hope you can forgive me.

201
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:51,060
Several women in the parish donated these.

202
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:54,530
You could meet them at church tomorrow.

203
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:58,534
- I know you’re not a believer…
- But I am…

204
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:01,870
In the Heavenly Father and His true prophet,

205
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:05,240
Joseph Smith.

206
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:09,244
I'll admit, I'm not well
versed in Mormonism.

207
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:14,083
Perhaps you could help me
understand why Joseph Smith

208
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:17,086
advocated polygamy, for instance.

209
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:20,389
Plural marriage is God's will.

210
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:22,057
- God's will?
- Yes.

211
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:25,511
The Lord commands us to
be fruitful and multiply

212
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:29,681
so that we can build the kingdom
of the latter-day saints.

213
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:31,850
But that kingdom is predicated

214
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,902
on the exploitation of women,

215
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:35,437
forcing them to share husbands,

216
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:37,689
refusing to allow them
to be ordained as clergy.

217
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:40,776
You... you must see the injustice in that.

218
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:44,113
I see clarity in it.

219
00:15:44,164 --> 00:15:46,415
I know who I'm meant to be...

220
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,450
A woman whose place is in the home

221
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:50,502
looking after her children.

222
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:57,426
[Train whistle blows in the distance]

223
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,762
The service is at 10:00.

224
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,808
So...

225
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:17,946
About what time do you expect
Mr. Durant to swoop in here

226
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,782
and free you?

227
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:22,067
He is your partner, right...

228
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,987
The one who runs things around here?

229
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:27,406
Hmm.

230
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:31,293
Yeah, I know men like him...

231
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,263
Big men. Keep you close...

232
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,465
Quit your yapping and get me a cup of water.

233
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:38,333
[Chuckles]

234
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:41,170
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

235
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:49,144
[Sighs]

236
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,181
[Groans]

237
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:58,687
[Grunting]

238
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,409
Whew!

239
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:10,332
[Grunts]

240
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:14,036
That should hold you till
Mr. Durant gets here.

241
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,781
Wallace?

242
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,285
It's a bad spot for a campfire.

243
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,921
Government took the casino.

244
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:40,790
Mickey's in jail.

245
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:44,594
I take it he didn't agree
with the change in ownership.

246
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,058
Just here to see my friend.

247
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,901
I figured you and me are square.

248
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:27,596
[Chuckles]

249
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,743
Uh-uh.

250
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:35,580
You come here to compare
bruises or bust me out?

251
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,382
The latter ain't up to me no more.

252
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,300
Yeah.

253
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:45,423
Mr. Durant's working on my release, so...

254
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,509
Wouldn't count on that.

255
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,728
Durant does what's best for Durant.

256
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,231
[Scoffs] That's how I ended up with 40 acres

257
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,266
of worthless land in the North Valley.

258
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,936
[Chuckles]

259
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,410
Shit, son.

260
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,328
Come here.

261
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,752
When I met you...

262
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,620
You didn't have nothing but
some cheap painted glass

263
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:19,541
and stories of home.

264
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:23,294
And you turned that into
a whorehouse and a casino.

265
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:27,775
You can do that again.

266
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,301
Hell with Durant.

267
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,138
Without him, I got no leverage.

268
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:36,474
That is exactly what Sean thought.

269
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,949
Don't leave me to bury you similar.

270
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,435
Okay?

271
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,209
All aboard!

272
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,161
Yes, sir. How y'all doing?

273
00:19:56,212 --> 00:20:00,498
Mickey's, uh, expecting
you to get him sprung.

274
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:03,051
Mickey needs to learn to curb his temper

275
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,669
if he wants to run a business.

276
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,805
Let me tell you something...

277
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,674
Casino's just the start of
what Campbell's fixing to take.

278
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,676
Pretty soon he'll come for it all.

279
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,479
Campbell is a bureaucrat, nothing more.

280
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,015
He's a carpetbagger.

281
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:19,851
First thing they did in the South,
rebuild the railroads.

282
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:23,071
Now, odds are,
he's got friends helped him do that,

283
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,739
men just itching to do it again.

284
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:27,192
Now, he knows that there's
money in it and power.

285
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,494
No carpetbagger will take my railroad.

286
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,831
[Chuckles] Yeah.

287
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,284
That's what I thought about
a farm back in Mississippi.

288
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,036
Have you conquered Sherman Peak yet?

289
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:39,504
Working on it.

290
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,590
Get my railroad moving, Mr. Bohannon.

291
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,053
I'd like you to sit in front tomorrow.

292
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,058
And try not to tug at your shirt collar.

293
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,612
I don't want to go to hell.

294
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,169
Months of silence,
and that's what you have to say?

295
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,747
I doubt that's God's plan for you.

296
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,083
You're naughty sometimes, but that...

297
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:28,887
I'm mormon.

298
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:32,257
[Crying softly, sniffles]

299
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,929
Where are your people?

300
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,599
[Crying]

301
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:50,074
It's all right.

302
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:54,112
We don't have to talk about this.

303
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,866
You're safe.

304
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,760
Mr. Durant.

305
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,253
Ah, Eva.

306
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,038
You know that stock you gave me last year?

307
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,456
- Mm-hmm.
- How much is it worth?

308
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,593
Virtually nothing at the moment.

309
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,128
I should go back to whoring.

310
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:15,133
If it's money you need, let me help.

311
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:17,802
Mr. Durant, I can't take
no charity from you.

312
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:20,305
Think of it as a loan.

313
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,275
No, I can't.

314
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,453
Church lady stopped by.

315
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,323
Yeah, and... I'm sorry. What?

316
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:41,292
The church lady.

317
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:44,078
She invited us to services tomorrow.

318
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,247
And, uh...

319
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,917
You don't want to go?

320
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,170
She doesn't like mormons.

321
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:56,924
I doubt she's met many before you,
but, uh...

322
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,927
Ruth speaks her mind,
but she's a good woman,

323
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:03,681
and she can help you make your way here.

324
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,024
That's my husband's job.

325
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:17,111
[Sighs]

326
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:21,115
I'm providing for you and William.

327
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,669
Father provided for all of
his wives and his children,

328
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,788
but he still ate with us,

329
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,207
worshipped with us.

330
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:36,381
Much like the life that you
had with your first wife...

331
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:41,552
But you left all of that behind.

332
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,900
[Sighs]

333
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,576
There was a war.

334
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:21,642
War's over.

335
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:37,275
Get back inside.

336
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:41,329
Go on.

337
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,171
You know, you...
you did right by me with this marriage.

338
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,459
I’m grateful, I am.

339
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,130
I guess, uh…

340
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:03,017
I should have known that… family life wasn’t for you.

341
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,599
Start with the people Campbell
worked with in Atlanta.

342
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,301
See if any of them were railroad men.

343
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:21,971
Oh, and find out what involvement he had

344
00:25:22,006 --> 00:25:24,874
in the reconstruction of
the railroads after the war.

345
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,144
You do know I have an engineering degree.

346
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:29,779
Then you should have the intelligence

347
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:32,448
to be able to send a few telegrams.

348
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:36,935
That will be all, Delaney.

349
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,270
Ah, Eva!

350
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,441
You came around.

351
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,915
I'll take your money, Mr. Durant...

352
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,248
For a poke.

353
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,283
[Coughs]

354
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,452
[Laughing] No, you misunderstand!

355
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:58,206
No, I... that was not
a condition of my offer.

356
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,091
[Sighs] Look, I know I
ain't so pretty right now,

357
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:01,593
but I clean up good.

358
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,261
No! [Stammers]

359
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,129
Eva, you're beautiful.

360
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,800
Well, then why not take a ride?

361
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,802
It's no trouble.

362
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:13,805
Don't mean nothing to me no mores, anyway.

363
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:17,108
That, my dear, is a tragedy.

364
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:24,115
I like you.
