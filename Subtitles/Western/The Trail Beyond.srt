1
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:18,478
I received your letter and got here
as quickly as I could.

2
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,162
now I am going to tell you why I sent for you.

3
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:26,419
20 years ago my brother and I
quarreled over a woman

4
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:31,827
he married her. they relocated near
Kennegamy house, northern Canada.

5
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:37,288
a child was born, a girl.
wife died

6
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:42,745
I heard that my brother
had strangely disappeared.

7
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:46,803
lately I have had a desire
to see that niece of mine.

8
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:50,587
and find out
just what happened to my brother.

9
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,419
that's why I sent for you.

10
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,105
I am afraid I couldn't stand a drift.

11
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:57,328
I will be glad to do everything I can.

12
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,432
you know, I haven't forgotten that
you were dad's best friend.

13
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:06,539
you see
my brother's name was John Ball...

14
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:08,870
wife's name was, Marie.

15
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,981
more likely,
that will be the girls name too.

16
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:17,843
its my hope that she will spend the
remaining years of my life, here with me.

17
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:19,252
you know son ?

18
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,805
some day she is going to inherit
this here, the ranch of the pines.

19
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:26,689
I understand and I will do my best to find her.

20
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:28,153
couldn't ask no more than that.

21
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,410
-when can you leave?
-on the morning train..

22
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:31,627
Good!

23
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:51,343
Rod Drew!
what are you doing here ?

24
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:53,807
well hello Bobby?
where are you heading for?

25
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,042
I am going home.
I just graduated.

26
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,200
that's nice!
say, how is the old Alma Mater?

27
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,230
oh, kind a quiet now...

28
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,178
they haven't found any cows or goats
in the dormitory since you left.

29
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,180
don't tell me the place has deteriorated
into a school of learning.

30
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,331
sit down

31
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,957
Oh, I cant now !
my mind is in the middle of a poker game.

32
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,620
but I have a lot to tell you,
I will be back later.

33
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:15,964
okay.

34
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,746
-don't loose your shirt !
-No!

35
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,940
I saw from where that one came from.

36
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,735
what are you doing, getting sore
when you start to loose?

37
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:49,364
you tin horn ...

38
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:07,046
I didn't do it, Rod.
they framed me.

39
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,672
I caught him cheating and
he pulled a gun on me.

40
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:10,765
its murder.

41
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,036
come on.

42
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:03,868
nice way to have a bath.

43
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:05,628
you shouldn't have done that Rod.

44
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:07,896
now you are in it, as much as I am.

45
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,425
don't worry about that, Bobby.

46
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,192
the main thing is to get out of here
before they pick us up.

47
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,863
we are about a mile from Fort Minnetaki.

48
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,587
we should be able to buy 
a change of clothes there.

49
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,060
lets get started.

50
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:24,951
here you are, Mister.

51
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:30,639
come on, Bobby.

52
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:42,339
telegram for you Martial.

53
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,645
it must be that fellow
who drifted down in this morning.

54
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,490
well, there they are now.
we are going to have a talk with them.

55
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:24,821
hey you fellas, wait a minute.

56
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:26,700
wait a minute there.

57
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:29,307
come on, Bobby.

58
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,191
that's them alright !
come on lets run them down.

59
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:36,022
we got to jump for it.
It's our only chance.

60
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:44,902
they got away.
notify the Mountain police.

61
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,070
from Minetaki
they have headed north.

62
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:50,892
one of them is half-breed, but we 
do not have any description of the other.

63
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,083
- you better start at Fort Minnetaki.
- Yes Sir !

64
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,417
we can take a shortcut through Wabinosh 
House, its on the bend of the river.

65
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:08,092
once we make there,
we will be safe for a while.

66
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:28,670
the cabin looks deserted.
we can camp there for the night.

67
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,526
Gold !

68
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:36,810
It's a map.

69
00:10:38,827 --> 00:10:39,890
they must have fought for it.

70
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:42,427
shows the location of their mine.

71
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:46,626
We, John Ball and Peter Plante...
having discovered gold at this point

72
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:49,928
do hereby agree to joint partnership in it
and do pledge ourselves ...

73
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:53,230
to forgot our past differences and work in
mutual goodwill and honesty

74
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:55,870
'so help us God'
signed John Ball and Peter Plante.

75
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,907
so this is what happened to John Ball.

76
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:05,615
John Ball?
why are you interested in him ?

77
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:08,152
he is one of the reasons I am up here.

78
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:09,735
and the other ?

79
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:11,332
his daughter.

80
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,752
Bobby, when we get to Wabinosh House...

81
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:16,799
we will make a search for this mine.

82
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,870
Well, Bobby!

83
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:41,153
-Bobby!
-FeIice!

84
00:11:44,216 --> 00:11:46,175
gee .. I am glad to see you.

85
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,551
I am glad to see you, Bobby.

86
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:54,533
FeIice, this is Rod Drew.
my best friend in college.

87
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,238
Miss Newsome.

88
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:57,803
how do you do Miss Newsome?

89
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,587
how do you do Mister Drew.

90
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:02,519
well how are you Bobby?
glad to see you back.

91
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,426
I am glad to be back Mister Newsome.

92
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:07,769
Mister Newsome, this is Rod Drew.

93
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:09,588
How do you do Mister Newsome !

94
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:11,641
howdy!
are you going to be with us for some time?

95
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,693
no, I am afraid not. we are only going to stay
long enough to get supplies.

96
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:15,619
Oh!

97
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:17,576
where are you going?

98
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,717
well ! you see ..

99
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:25,341
we were thinking of hunting wolves..
and we want to get our trap plans plotted early

100
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:26,495
Oh!

101
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,995
in the mean time I have some things here
I would like to leave with you for safekeeping.

102
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:32,966
-would you please keep this safe?
-well, certainly !

103
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,423
-Benoit ! place this in the safe.
-Oui, monsieur.

104
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,468
FeIice will get you what supplies you need.

105
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,083
we can put you up right here
at the post.

106
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:47,284
thanks Mister Newsome,
that will be fine.

107
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:54,899
you boys come along with me now
and I will show you to your room.

108
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:36,067
- Bonjour LaRocque.
- Bonjour. Eh! what have you got ?

109
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:38,318
you wait I show you.

110
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:46,226
-more bullets, eh?
-oui !

111
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:50,180
when the winter catches in
we will attack Wabinosh House...

112
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,640
and bring them to knees
with their our own ammunition, eh?.

113
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,360
oui, and she is coming in pretty quick now.
and the ammunition is very low.

114
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,386
but Newsome, he don't know that.

115
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:03,592
I emptied his box and put them
back on the shelves.

116
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,043
good.

117
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:08,293
and now, I have the grand news for you.

118
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:13,130
two strangers have arrived at the post
with a map full of gold.

119
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,179
-a map of gold ?
-Oui.

120
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,203
-where is it?
-Je ne sais pas.

121
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:20,070
I have only seen the word 'Gold'
marked on the map.

122
00:14:20,537 --> 00:14:21,891
Newsome had me put it into the safe.

123
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:25,722
-you can open that safe ?
-do not know if I can do that.

124
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:27,796
-you try?
-Oui.

125
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:30,034
I will give you two men.
you will go there tonight.

126
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,412
Oui.

127
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,081
it is of no use,
I cannot get it.

128
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,453
but she can.

129
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,269
she knows the combination.

130
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,097
Ah!

131
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,987
-Benoit!
-get her.

132
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,858
Ah, ah!

133
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:32,668
FeIice, FeIice!

134
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:35,063
she is gone!

135
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,231
Eh!
who is this?

136
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:38,201
its Abonga.

137
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:39,383
- what are you doing here ?

138
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,318
we found him wounded in Felice's room.
and she is gone.

139
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:51,845
FeIice gone ?

140
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,894
Ah!
LaRocque, eh?

141
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:00,486
I have seen him before
must have taken her to his place.

142
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:01,745
who is LaRocque?

143
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:03,635
renegade trader
stationed up in the river here

144
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,186
been giving us plenty of trouble,

145
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,256
what were they after?

146
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,811
there is nothing up here of value.
not even in the safe.

147
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,704
-maybe its the map.
- we got to find FeIice!

148
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,291
-we better head for LaRocque.
-we can go by canoe.

149
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,993
No, you cannot go that way.
there's not enough water.

150
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:19,405
we might make it.

151
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:21,478
one thing for certain.

152
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:24,136
it sure would give them surprise
if you did get through.

153
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:25,762
come on, lets try it.

154
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:02,278
I couldn't open the safe, but FeIice
she knows the combination.

155
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,387
get her and bring her here.

156
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:24,392
Jules LaRocque!
so you are behind all this ?

157
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:29,255
you will tell us the combination of that safe
and we will set you free.

158
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,415
I will tell you nothing.

159
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,583
lets see maybe you will.

160
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,584
take one of their guns and start something.

161
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:46,465
meet me at the back door.

162
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,176
Bobby!

163
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:36,806
get him !

164
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,156
My gosh, she is getting away

165
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,037
Eh, Bobby!

166
00:22:42,726 --> 00:22:45,124
I have been thinking, maybe FeIice
can help me with my quest.

167
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:47,256
so you are up here on a quest ?

168
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,882
I didn't come here, just to hunt wolves.

169
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:54,360
I will be very careful, if I were you.

170
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:59,565
man-hunters are not exactly welcomed
by most people around here.

171
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,967
its not a man I am looking for,
its a woman.

172
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:06,174
a young woman.
she is just about your age.

173
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:09,137
that sounds interesting,
tell me about it.

174
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:12,158
don't you think we better inform your father
that you are safe ?

175
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,317
perhaps you are right, Bobby.

176
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:20,157
you make big mistake when
you bring that girl here.

177
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,203
I had too !
she has seen me.

178
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:25,170
and now I cannot go back.

179
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:30,651
we will send Marie!
she is not known there.

180
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:33,217
Oui, that's a good idea.

181
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:36,559
she can tell them she escaped from
Kennegamy House.

182
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:38,513
he will need someone for my place.

183
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:43,453
that stranger have a map of gold
that you must get.

184
00:23:44,545 --> 00:23:45,849
but you must not tell him anything.

185
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:50,017
- leave it to me. I will get it.
- I know.

186
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:03,293
excuse me , monsieur.
are you Mr. Newsome?

187
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:04,572
Yes.

188
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,564
I am Marie LaFIeur
from Kennegamy House.

189
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,562
I was a clerk there,
and also took care of the accounts.

190
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,108
I am looking for work.

191
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:14,747
-can you keep books?
-Oui monsieur.

192
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:17,766
well you have got a job right now
as far as I am concerned.

193
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:19,861
if you can help me out of this mess.

194
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:21,942
that will be simple, monsieur.

195
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,518
I will go and have a room prepare 
for you right away.

196
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:25,783
thank you.

197
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,850
did you say your name was Marie?

198
00:24:34,287 --> 00:24:35,122
Oui monsieur.

199
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:38,272
I heard you say that you are from
Kennegamy House.

200
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:40,313
have you lived along there long ?

201
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:42,128
you are very inquisitive, monsieur.

202
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:44,968
I don't mean to be,
but I am very interested.

203
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:46,969
I would like to have a talk with you.

204
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:48,477
if you wish.

205
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:55,096
what's the matter FeIice?

206
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:59,568
I don't see why he should be so interested
in that girl.

207
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:03,753
what do you care ?
are you beginning to like him ?

208
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,116
why no.

209
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:09,219
things haven't been the same between
you and me Felice.

210
00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:11,496
not since you met him,

211
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:13,994
I owe him my life.

212
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:16,400
but I am not going to let him 
come between us.

213
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:18,480
why Bobby!

214
00:25:19,793 --> 00:25:21,450
I never realized that you felt that way
about me.

215
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,891
do you have your map, young man ?

216
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:36,110
better not take any chances.

217
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:38,721
that LaRocque crowd is not
giving up that easily.

218
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:40,018
we will be watching for them.

219
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:41,924
I am keeping my eye on them too.

220
00:25:43,097 --> 00:25:44,300
getting too many of them to be comfortable.

221
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,790
I have to keep watch on them..

222
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,131
Good-bye Mr. Newsome.

223
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,413
take care of yourself. well good luck !
- thank you.

224
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:54,725
Bobby, its not same without you.
Good-bye.

225
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,845
goodbye, FeIice.

226
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,471
goodbye, Rod.

227
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:08,197
goodbye Bobby.

228
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:11,120
goodbye, FeIice.

229
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,602
well, what you find out ?

230
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:33,984
oh, he don't answer any questions.

231
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,292
I cant find out nothing from him
about the map.

232
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,918
and this morning they start
down the river.

233
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:41,402
it is too late.

234
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,667
no, I do not think it is yet too late.

235
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:46,853
I have another idea.

236
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:51,332
well ?

237
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:52,988
they leave this morning.

238
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:56,317
yeah, I know. but what you found out
at the mountain police post ?

239
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,187
I found out plenty.

240
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:00,225
they are wanted men.

241
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:03,462
a mountain patrol left fort Minekati 
this morning to find them.

242
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:08,136
that is bad. if the police get them,
we loose the map.

243
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:11,496
we must beat the police.

244
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,183
a mounty!

245
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,568
get away from that gun.
you are under arrest.

246
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:36,128
hit the trail, you two.

247
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:37,923
we are heading for Kennegamy House.

248
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:49,755
not that way, this way.

249
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:51,802
I thought the Kennegamy House
was south west of here.

250
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,882
I said we are heading this way.

251
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:17,346
so it is your little game, is it ?

252
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,061
pretty clever, eh !

253
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,766
almost as clever, the way you got FeIice.

254
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,047
I should kill you for that.

255
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:27,189
get the map !

256
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:35,660
tie them up, put them in there.

257
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,134
line up against that wall.

258
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:02,852
so you are the real Mounty !

259
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:05,855
I thought that other guy 
was a fake.

260
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:11,502
see we go up the Way Sugar
to the Big Mackey.

261
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:14,969
come... we go !

262
00:29:18,806 --> 00:29:22,219
we got to get out of here.
LaRouque must be way ahead of us.

263
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:25,587
- yeah ! with our map.
- that's where you are wrong.

264
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,696
I left the real one on my boot.

265
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:47,050
you are not turning him loose, are you ?
he is the law !

266
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,416
I am not going to live him here to die.

267
00:30:51,612 --> 00:30:53,958
you can do what you want.
but if you turn me loose I will make arrest.

268
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:56,567
don't be crazy Rod.

269
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,137
you turn him loose and
we don't have a chance.

270
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:01,588
he will have every man on the fort
trailing us.

271
00:31:02,451 --> 00:31:06,218
listen, we may be your prisoners,
but you are coming along with us.

272
00:31:06,624 --> 00:31:08,625
till we find out what this map
leads us into.

273
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:36,935
that's white peak al right, and according
to the map, it is right below us.

274
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:24,904
here it is.

275
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:28,482
there must be a small fortune in there.

276
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:31,562
what's this ?

277
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:51,668
by Jove it looks like FeIice !

278
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,046
why Bobby,
is FeIice John Bali's daughter ?

279
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,127
you knew it all the time,
why didn't you tell me ?

280
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:09,219
I knew, if you find out,
you will take here with you and I loose her.

281
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:12,022
I know now, that she doesn't care for me.

282
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:16,788
well, we better get started.

283
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:20,502
LaRocque will know by now that he has
been send into a wild goose chase.

284
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:22,322
and nothing will stop him.

285
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,355
it is not here.

286
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:46,436
we have been tricked.

287
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:49,340
we go back to the cabin.

288
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:18,557
hey look!

289
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:19,917
maybe we will find them in the creek.

290
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,150
look, there they go.

291
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:13,007
keep rowing, Bobby!

292
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,078
Oh, look !

293
00:38:19,011 --> 00:38:21,261
we got to stop it, the fall is just below there.

294
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,217
not good Bobby.

295
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,106
we have got to get him back
to Wabinosh House.

296
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:10,812
three time they fooled us.
but no more.

297
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,283
you will bring all the men here.

298
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:15,810
this time we will fool them.

299
00:40:16,918 --> 00:40:19,314
we will attack Wabinosh House
for the gold and the furs.

300
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:22,927
and they will find the ammunitions all gone.

301
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:31,819
Ah, Mecogui!
what did you find out ?

302
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:35,496
20, 30 men hold big pow wow with LaRocque.

303
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:36,896
him come here quick.

304
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,646
they probably intend to attack.

305
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,160
thanks Mecogui,

306
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:43,514
I will get guns and ammunition ready.
come on Bobby!

307
00:40:45,036 --> 00:40:45,636
wait !

308
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,458
there is a mounted police force
at fort Mippigon...

309
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:53,468
and I am deputizing you to and get there.

310
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:55,319
I will get them Ryan.

311
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,525
Mr. Newsome, these are empty !

312
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:11,938
empty ?

313
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:21,589
Benoit, to blame for this.
- we cannot hold them forever.

314
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:25,231
Bryan intended that we
get help from Fort Mippigon.

315
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,914
going after them.
hold up them as long as you can.

316
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,625
LaRocque gang is attacking Wabinosh House.

317
00:42:13,728 --> 00:42:16,524
I have only three men here, but we are
deputizing every men in the settlement.

318
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:17,694
call assembly.

319
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,732
everyone is ready?
we go !

320
00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:51,047
someone must have tipped them off.

321
00:45:51,684 --> 00:45:53,587
no matter, but they cannot hold for long.

322
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:57,889
you lead them to attack
while I go for Marie.

323
00:45:58,699 --> 00:45:59,329
Oui, beau.

324
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:25,787
- good ! everything there !
- yes, most of it.

325
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,459
wait I will get the rest.

326
00:46:44,796 --> 00:46:45,509
not so fast, Marie!

327
00:46:55,371 --> 00:46:56,856
here they come !
take cover, quick !

328
00:53:56,926 --> 00:54:00,252
well, Ryan, we are ready to go back
anytime you are.

329
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,289
that wont be necessary.

330
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:07,253
the sergeant told me, the guy that Bobby
had the fight, didn't die after all.

331
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,060
when he recovered consciousness
he exonerated Bobby from shooting.

332
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:12,571
and you boys are free.
