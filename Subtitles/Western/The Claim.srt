00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,281
Come on, Buddy,

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,920
Let them go, Buddy.

00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,199
Buddy!

5
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,413
Well, ladies, let's go.

00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,488
- Why?
- It's the law.

10
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,518
These weapons belong
the railway.

11
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,029
Not matter.

12
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,761
Mr. Dillon said:
"No guns to town."

13
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,166
Do not take them.

14
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,968
- Let them!
- Otherwise, you do not enter here.

15
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,942
We are happy to cooperate.
Give them your weapons.

00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,966
Help me.

17
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,774

00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,644
It is clean.

20
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,448
It is not with me.
Come on, girls.

21
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,820
Take me to the dollar into gold.

22
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,984
- I do not understand.
- Come, Hope.

23
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,119
Come on, just a little turn.

24
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,040
Stop! Disperse!

25
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,340
Disperse! Go away!

26
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,481
Help me to remove the harness.

27
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,077
Come on, guys.
Separate yourselves. Move away.

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,247
- Stay away.
- Thank you.

29
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,757
I did not want
it torments you.

30
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,625
- You are the railroad?
- Yes.

31
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,029
I am the Chief Engineer
Central Pacific.

32
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,693
- I came to see Mr. Dillon.
- It's true.

33
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,224
You have family?

34
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,898
It's not my family.
I carry the baggage anyway.

35
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,273
- Very nice.
- It's the least we can do.

36
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,075
Did you hear that, Mom?
He wants to see Mr. Dillon.

37
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,379
Come on, guys.
We go to the warehouse.

Hurry up!

00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,625
What is your name?

40
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,388
Hope. Hope Burn.

41
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,885
It's a pretty name.

42
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,295
Thank you.

43
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
What brings you
here in Kingdom Come?

44
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,133
We visit
to the family.

45
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,198
How many people live here?

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,607
1200.

47
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,845
- I'm waiting here for bags.

00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,256
I do not

49
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,127
I'm on it.

50
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,473
Dalglish, if you want
wait here,

51
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,441
I'll see
if Mr. Dillon is ready.

52
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,636
Fernando, give him drink.

53
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,507
Come in.

54
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,013
The engineer of the railways.

55
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,212
It is how?

56
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,813
It's a blue. No problems.

57
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,794
Mr. Dillon will receive you,
Mr. Dalglish.

58
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,504
Mr. Dillon, he is here.

59
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,012
Choose a number.

60
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,448
I do not play.
I like to drink.

61
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,885
Get it in a number.
It will be finished before your glass.

62
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,981
- It's your money.
- I just give it to you.

63
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,254
I do not accept
gifts, Mr. Dillon.

64
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,023
Not matter.

65
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,258
You think I bought?

66
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,927
- You would not be the first.
- It is down to the hotel.

67
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:46,427
I said you had
a new bed, but no way.

68
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,442
This is when your birthday?

69
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,643
In September.

70
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,554
On 23.

71
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,421
I met a traveler
come of an ancient land ...

72
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,256
who said: "Two vast
legs of stone ... "

73
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,555
"Near them, on the sands ...

74
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,091
"Lay a face
half-buried ...

75
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,127
"Whose lips
crumpled and wrinkled ... "

76
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,662
Zero.

77
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,268
- I lost your money.
- Do not worry.

78
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,503
The casino is to it.

79
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,539
- Your song was beautiful.
- Thank you.

80
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,847
Mr. Dalglish works
for railways.

81
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,786
Dalglish? What as the name?

82
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,120
- It's Scottish.
- 0h, Scotland.

83
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,022
How romantic.

84
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:45,190
Look at my work, while O
powerful, and despair-you!

85
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,994
The town of Kingdom Come ...

86
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,398
would wish
welcome ...

87
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,425
the Company
Pacific Railway.

88
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,864
In their honor ...

89
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,842
all dances
are free.

90
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,341
Do you women!

91
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,519
Gentlemen?

92
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,720
Let me introduce you
two lovely ladies.

93
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,958
The French name is Sue.
It will supplement your education.

94
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,898
- And this is Annie.
- Good evening.

95
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,662
I need to be educated?

96
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,637
He took lessons
by San Francisco.

97
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,571
You come from far away.

98
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,167
Will you refuse such
ladies? It is an insult.

99
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,734
He has his views on anyone.

100
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,075
There, you?

101
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,308
No, she arrived
in care.

102
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,977
A woman from the East.
They have no type.

103
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,179
I Luif forget.

104
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,517
You dance?

105
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,990
With Mr. Dillon, only.

106
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,891
I did not offend you.

107
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,386
- I am not.
- But I am.

108
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,333
- I did not offend you.
- How will I get over it?

109
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,932
I apologize.
Dufond heart.

110
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,306
My God! What a voice!

111
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,488
He is young.

112
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,098
- Younger than you.
- More beautiful than you.

113
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,701
No one is more
beautiful than me.

114
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,813
It is not more beautiful than you.

115
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,320
Ouch! My hair!

116
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,154
You're hurting me.

117
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,129
- You like to hurt me.
- No.

118
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,143
Vauneen ...

119
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,046
- Give us another whiskey.
- And a whiskey.

120
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,277
Mr. Dalglish, railways.

121
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,750
Enchanted.

122
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,550
Welcome. You will
well treated. You want to smoke?

123
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,453
A cigar?

124
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,185
Vauneen! Come!

125
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,957
God!

126
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,092
Sweetley! Stop it!
What tufais?

127
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,763
What's going on?

128
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,898
He tried to pay me with this.

129
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,398
- It's my bag of gold.
- He lost the card.

130
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,708
I never heard
that Delaney was playing.

131
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,238
That's why he lost.
Lack of experience.

132
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,013
You'd better
introduce you to Mr. Dillon.

133
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,384
Tomorrow at dawn. Get out.

134
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,321
The show is over.

135
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,450
Let it work.
A tour here.

136
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,755
It's coming.

137
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,661
- Why not lock them up?
- No need.

138
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,257
Failure to appear
not Dillon,

139
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,597
they must leave the city.

140
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,900
It is a city clean.
It's good for the company.

141
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,466
And you! Going on.
Sorry, it's mine.

142
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,377
Why not both?

143
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,611
Down the hall,
The bed birds.

144
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,276
We want to treat it.

145
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,985
Have a good week.

146
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,455
Take it easy,
the girls. He is young.

147
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,619
- Where is he?
- At the end of the corridor.

148
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,821
It's been hours
I wait.

149
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:47,629
Ilfaudra wait.
Have you brought the train into town?

150
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,998
You've missed the boat again, Jim.

151
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,868
Come on, do not mind.

152
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,200
It's true that you will choose
the name of the station?

153
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,767
Give him my name.

154
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,904
- What is your name?
- Sarah.

155
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,877
He'll call Sue, like me.

156
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,010
Sue City.

157
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,790
The railway
is the largest ...

158
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,121
of all American history.

159
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,786
It's not you who selected.

160
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,022
- Ilfaut deserve it.
- No kidding, really?

161
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,586
Yes.

162
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,859
Sorry.

163
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,624
Why it is called Sue?

164
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,898
Because I
fuck you so deep ...

165
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,199
so, so deep ...

166
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,969
that your cock will be found
somewhere in California.

167
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,956
Come here, quick.

168
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,268
That's him.

169
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,534
It's Mr. Dillon.

170
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,637
He, on the horse?

171
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,189
Here, take this.

172
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,933
Give them to Mr. Dillon.

173
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,368
A one else.

174
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,405
How are you?

175
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,669
Hurry up.

176
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,873
I ...

177
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,940
Harry Grimes,
concession Roughwood,

00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,883

racked color and dust
Mr. Delaney gold ...

181
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,780
when he was
drunk and asleep.

182
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,986
I know I was wrong.

183
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,295
I deserve punishment.

184
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,135
The normal sentence
is 50 blows.

185
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,902
Mr. Dillon was transferred to 25 ...

186
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,604
because he knows that this
will not happen again.

187
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,960
The show is over,
guys!

188
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,658
Go home!

189
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,337
Mr. Dillon!

190
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,682
I was told to give you this.

191
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,081
What is it?

192
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,783
This is the part of Mrs. Burn.

193
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,320
Hope you are?

194
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,165
Mr. Dillon.

195
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,472
Burn miss!

196
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,544
- Can I accompany you?
- Yes.

197
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,145
Mr. Dillon is your parent?

198
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,313
Yes, indeed.

199
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,084
Our rich parent.

200
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,092
It's good to have
a parent like him.

201
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,564
Unless he does hunting
with a whip.

202
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:29,010
In many cities,
this man would have been lynched.

203
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,949
Mr. Dillon has probably
saved his life.

204
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,418
Have you ever seen a lynching?

205
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,149
J'aifailli lynched
myself, once.

206
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,487
- Really?
- A city waiting ...

207
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,152
its railway.

208
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,594
I had to tell them that
pass 25 km to the north.

209
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,360
The idea of ??a rope to the coup
I would change my mind.

210
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,525
But no.

211
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,265
It must be fascinating
to be in the nature ...

212
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,298
with the lynchers, grizzly bears
and wild Indians.

213
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,741
It is.

214
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,647
Can I accompany you?

215
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,247
It's not very pleasant.

216
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,584
I am strong.
I do not slow you down.

217
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,350
- Okay.
- When?

218
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,087
Tomorrow morning.

219
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,425
The path
above the city.

220
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,931
We will return in the evening.

221
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,230
It makes me happy.
Thank you, Mr. Dalglish.

222
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,928
See you tomorrow.

223
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,855
Look!

224
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,193
I Dufeu and eat ...
if you want.

225
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,813
It's pork stew.

226
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,051
I have a bowl.

227
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,965
- Where are you from?
- In Dublin.

228
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,300
- And you?
- In Poland.

229
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,532
Want to drink?

230
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,534
Thank you.

231
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,236
I have not seen a woman ...

232
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,746
long time.

233
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,845
I understand.

234
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,952
- You have found?
- There is no gold in America.

235
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,424
No more gold than elephants.

236
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,033
It provides no pleasure.

237
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,863
A man loses his courage.

238
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,602
Even if it discovers
a pool, he loses.

239
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,204
There's more?

240
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,446
I do not need gold.

241
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,279
I need a woman.

242
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,188
Take that.

243
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,285
- On exchange.
- You do not part with.

244
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:47,128
I dragged on for six months
on this forsaken land.

245
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,767
I started with two mules,
a cart and luggage.

246
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,940
- I no longer owns it.
- You do not possess me.

247
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,338
The concession.

248
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,943
I give you the concession.

249
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,862
- Daniel.
- Shut up. Let me think.

250
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,966
I take the child as well.

251
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,237
I will be happy.

252
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,903
Want to sell your child?

253
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,306
I'm serious.

254
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,714
This is my breath.

255
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,988
You see how
he clings to coal?

256
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,131
Yes, he has taken.

257
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,838
More slowly.

258
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,583
It warms the outside ...

259
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,985
and when it's hot ...

260
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,148
you pass on your face,
your hands ...

261
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,714
Get warm all day.

262
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:54,952
Thank you.

263
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,592
- You want good shoes?
- It's OK.

264
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,260
- You're not cold?
- No.

265
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:08,000
- Tell me if your feet are freezing.
- I come from pioneer.

266
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,734
My father was one.

267
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,175
My mother also.

268
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,203
I was a baby when all
California was like that.

269
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,477
They found gold?

270
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,043
A little.

271
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,247
Not enough.

272
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,658
They never
said as it was beautiful.

273
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,663
It's beautiful.

274
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,995
HowTo mount
a train here?

275
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,831
Ilfautfaire jump
the mountain.

276
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,860
That may be what will be done.

277
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,573
Tunneling.

278
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,637
Can I have
more water for my mother?

279
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,176
- Of course.
- Thank you.

280
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,480
You're welcome.

281
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,287
- Miss Burn?
- Yes?

282
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,852
We have a mutual friend.

283
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,631
A Mr. Dalglish?

284
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,963
Oh, yes.

285
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,528
My name is Lucia.

286
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,938
Enchanted. Mine is Hope.

287
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,965
- It's a pretty name.
- Thank you.

288
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,069
You can call me Lucy.

289
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,741
I came to ask you
from Dillon ...

290
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,841
if you wanted
visit us.

291
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,715
Oh, yes. Thank you.

292
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,084
When?

293
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,214
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

294
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,451
Whenever you want.
Now, if you want.

295
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,951
I'm not sure.

296
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,087
- My mother ...
- Oh, come with your mother.

297
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,932
- I will ask.
- I'm waiting here.

298
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,127
Okay.

299
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,739
Dillon is below.

300
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,543
I must visit him.

301
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,247
- You too.
- Dillon?

302
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,619
It is below.

303
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:22,196
- She knows we're here?
- Mr. Dalglish told him.

304
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,667
- Can I go?
- Yes.

305
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,728
Cap up.

306
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,604
- I have no time. She waits.
- It will wait.

307
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,371
Come here.

308
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,714
Do not talk too much there.

309
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,013
Okay? Answer when
it speaks to you.

310
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,418
About Dillon.
Say nothing of yourself.

311
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,650
Do not worry.
I know quoifaire.

312
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,419
Goodbye.

313
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,826
- Where are you, Hope?
- In Boston.

314
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,475
I would go to Boston.

315
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,412
Tonight, Mr. Dalglish will fall
madly in love with you.

316
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,142
I do not think.

317
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,151
- Why would he do?
- Because you will be splendid.

318
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,483
Let moifaire.
We captives.

319
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,187
I tried to do
like San Francisco.

320
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,201
Exactly.

321
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,743
- Let's start.
- Okay.

322
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,264
What do you think of the form?

323
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,370
I've never worn
like it. I do not know.

324
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,804
Here is the skirt that goes with it.

325
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,535
She is so beautiful.

326
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,744
- You can change the lace.
- It will be too big?

327
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,544
We can fix that.

328
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,284
Come on, guys. Move
boxes and boards!

329
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,525
Thank you.

330
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,724
We want to get
before nightfall. Go!

331
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,597
Go on. Keep it up!

332
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,185
Ladies ...

333
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,059
Ladies and gentlemen ...

334
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,030
we have a guest tonight.

335
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,693
A distinguished pianist
you just heard ...

336
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:21,535
and a famous actress
throughout the Americas.

337
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,869
Hope Burn miss.

338
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,812
There is a gorge ...

339
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,514
- What a beautiful song.
- Thank you.

340
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,783
What was she talking about?

341
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,882
It's a song about
the homeland of my ancestors.

342
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:42,825
- Portugal.
- You know what?

343
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,192
She has a mole
on the buttock.

344
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,901
The neighbors liked
the charming girl.

345
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,630
Calm down!

346
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,567
All of you!

347
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,140
Continue.

348
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,776
Then one day
a letter arrived ...

349
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,750
with its passage already paid ...

350
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:10,015
for land flowing
Missouri and Mississippi.

351
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,252
She made her luggage
and everything was ready ...

352
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,590
and a day at the door ...

353
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:20,461
the widow, the brokenhearted,
separated from her Noreen Bawn.

354
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,795
I'm going to change.

355
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,393
The widow waited
many years.

356
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,997
But one evening through the door,
a slender woman entered.

357
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,142
It was
expensive clothes.

358
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,610
She said: "Mother,
you know me?

359
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,341
"I only caught a cold."

360
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,907
But two scarlet spots
his cheeks ...

361
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,509
told
their sad story.

362
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,482
There is a grave
Old Shooting Connail ...

363
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,616
where the wild flowers
stir gently.

364
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,092
An old woman sobbing
kneeling at the grave.

365
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,598
She said:
"Noreen, you hear me?

366
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,594
"I am alone
since you left.

367
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,069
"The curse
of emigration ...

368
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:03,039
"Put you there, my Noreen Bawn."

369
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,681
Daniel, stop!

370
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,248
Come!

371
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,941
So, dear youth
and tender girls ...

372
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,714
think before you leave.

373
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,978
Your humble
Irish houses ...

374
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,753
you do not see
that there really.

375
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:58,284
What gold and pleasure
without his health and strength?

376
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,526
If you are thinking of emigrating,
remember Noreen Bawn.

377
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,949
It's been years ...

378
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,078
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

379
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,385
- It was lovely.
- Thank you.

380
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,651
Sing, Dalglish.

381
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,591
- Sing! Sing!
- Oh, no!

382
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,659
- Sing!
- No!

383
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,596
Sing! Sing!

384
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,893
I know this ballad.

385
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,901
I recited
often to my father.

386
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,804
He was still crying at the end.

387
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,538
How was it?

388
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,375
My father?

389
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:52,712
You are not parents?

390
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,344
Mom said you
are related by marriage.

391
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,083
Oh, Shenandoah

392
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,719
Because I miss you

393
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,853
It's too high.

394
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,262
Again. Again.

395
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,129
- Do it again.
- Right now?

396
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,197
Do you have children?

397
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,329
Children?

398
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,706
Oh, Shenandoah

399
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,542
Because I miss you

400
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:28,247
In the distance, river flood

401
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,886
Oh, Shenandoah

402
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,586
As I hear you

403
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,729
Away

404
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,892
I am far

405
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:50,067
I crossed the great Missouri

406
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:55,803
No.

407
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,279
Stop it.

408
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,609
You are special.

409
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,053
Really?

410
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,885
Very special.

411
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,823
No, you say that ...

412
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,260
and then you go with your big
nitroglycerin box ...

413
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,231
and you never come back.

414
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,496
If I come back.

415
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,335
What are you doing in the hallway?
You have men in there.

416
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,896
The job before the cigarette.

417
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,206
Bellanger. The time has passed.

418
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,974
I want money.

419
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,173
- Annie?
- Yes.

420
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,444
No gifts. Go!

421
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,111
- On the table.
- I know.

422
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,417
- Now.
- Where have you gone?

423
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,086
- It goes well ...
- It takes me another 30 dollars.

424
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,425
Mary, it is not there?

425
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:50,264
Bring your ass over here.
You do wait.

426
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,428
Going to do your job.

427
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,369
Dillon asked
from you.

428
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,274
What did you say?

429
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,972
You were a researcher
gold and should be wary.

430
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,447
You are very perceptive.

431
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,912
I have to go again tomorrow.

432
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,217
I must consider
the next valley.

433
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,620
You come back?

434
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,051
Yes.

435
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,693
- What are you looking for?
- My turn.

436
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:25,991
It is there.

437
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,973
It was a good night.

438
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,503
Yes? How?

439
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,104
$ 900 and 4 ounces.

440
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,240
It's good.

441
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,274
One of them pays Annie
for each minute of the day.

442
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,548
- I liked your song.
- Thank you.

443
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,852
Ilfaudrait
watch your man.

444
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,793
- As he looked at the small ...
- I beg you.

445
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,693
Well, it's just a child.

446
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,721
You were a
when he found you.

447
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,256
It Luif
marry an engineer.

448
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,395
I know very well
what I do.

449
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,099
- Good night.
- Good night.

450
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,340
Back to work.

451
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,829
I do not think
that you will return.

452
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,888
Of course there is.

453
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,991
I leave luggage here.

454
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,661
And me?

455
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:38,264
You'll come back looking
your luggage and you will let me.

456
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,901
I'll be back for you too.

457
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,609
You think more
in your luggage to me.

458
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,117
Go to sleep now.

459
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,003
It's going in the room
Mrs. Burn.

460
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,235
At the top of the stairs, right?

461
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,414
It's almost frozen.

462
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,896
It's so pretty.

463
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,833
- It seems not stupid?
- It suits you very well.

464
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,797
Thank you, Mom.

465
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,103
Where do I ask this, Madame?

466
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,802
Oh, that.

467
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,674
Mr. Dillon sent me
you up, ma'am.

468
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,645
I am not a package.

469
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,552
No. I wait for you outside.

470
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,577
Miss.

471
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,150
Mom.

472
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,288
Look at that.

473
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,645
That's it. I will
help you down.

474
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,318
How are you?

475
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,321
- You wait there.
- OK, Dan.

476
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,366
They say you're sick.

477
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,336
I am dying.

478
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,653
Burn died.

479
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,890
It did not leave anything.

480
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,021
I do not want that Hope suffers.

481
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,029
I hope you either.

482
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,964
Coffee?

483
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,372
I want $ 200 a year.

484
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,745
That's it.

485
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,282
If it's too, we can negotiate.

486
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,592
But I want
a written promise.

487
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,896
I no longer drink, Elena.

488
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,099
I want you to know.

489
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,869
I need money.

490
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,445
I need money for Hope.

491
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,683
Does she know?

492
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,538
It's cold here here.

493
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,141
Sweetley you deposit.

494
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,008
Mr. DeWolf.

495
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,544
Mr. Dillon.

496
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,280
Remain seated.

497
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,648
- Hello, Mr. Dillon.
- Open the door.

498
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:42,471
Oh, Dillon ... my love.

499
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,910
What is it?

500
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,281
A gift.

501
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,599
And that?

502
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,830
The titles of the show.

503
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,135
It is yours.

504
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,705
Why?

505
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,440
We have to finish this.

506
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,650
What are you talking?

507
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,952
It is a comfortable settlement.
You will not ...

508
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,719
I am not a whore!

509
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,387
I do not want.

510
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,191
Tell me why.

511
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,030
- The titles of the tobacco ...
- Stop with that!

512
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,561
- Why?
- It's impossible.

513
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,904
You think I do not know.
It is this girl.

514
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,604
You want to fuck her!
Sort of ... pig!

515
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,028
As soon as one has passed
the mountain, I will leave.

516
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,301
- You will see.
- You always say that.

517
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,967
She has one child.

518
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,533
Annie?

519
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,876
She left him in Sacramento.
We'll get him.

520
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,317
It will not be a life
with a kid.

521
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,649
I will find
a piece of land ...

522
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,848
and I'm going to
build a house.

523
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,826
Bellanger, you are
so full of shit.

524
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,092
You did not sit
since 1862.

525
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,860
I sat down.

526
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:56,957
Where?

527
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:00,493
In a brothel in San Francisco.

528
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,183
It is too narrow, boss.

529
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,888
- We will never build here.
- I've seen worse.

530
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,671
Come on, guys.
Bring the nitro.

531
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,942
Cross far.

532
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,881
Go right to the edge.

533
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,045
It peutfaire skip the rock.

534
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,418
Where?

535
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:52,922
There.

536
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,968
It's good.

537
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:14,273
Lord God!

538
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,938
Thomas!

539
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,407
"Surely goodness
and mercy ...

540
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,341
"Be with me all my life ...

541
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:49,072
"And I will always
in the house of the Lord.

542
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,239
"Amen."

543
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,805
Amen.

544
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,503
You can not pass.
You know that.

545
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,213
The train will stop
not to Kingdom Come?

546
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,840
So what?

547
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,874
And Annie, then?

548
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,750
There 's plenty of Annies.

549
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:34,980
But it is not Annie
you think.

550
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,786
Be careful
where you put it.

551
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:09,814
Hey, John?

552
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,061
T.J., you ready?

553
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,667
Come on, guys. Walk straight.

554
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,231
Ready?

555
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,799
Fire!

556
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,579
Straighten up and there!

557
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,390
Fire!

558
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,969
Fire!

559
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,274
Fire!

560
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,545
Continues to descend, T.J.!

561
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,986
Straighten up there!

562
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,791
Fire!

563
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:47,381
Mom.

564
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,953
There is music out.

565
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,061
Mrs. and Miss Burn,

566
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,899
Mr. Dillon asked
the pleasure of your company.

567
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,834
- When?
- Now.

568
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,472
Why?

569
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,707
Dillon wants
tell you in person.

570
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,904
Come on, straighten it!

571
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,941
Ms. Burn ...

572
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,911
I must speak.

573
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,238
Why all this?

574
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,865
I want us to get married.

575
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,912
- We are already married.
- No one knows.

576
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,608
It would settle everything.

577
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,282
You should have all the money
you want.

578
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,843
I have no other family.

579
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,315
Hope inherit after death.

580
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,394
And your little lady?

581
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:17,590
It has nothing to do with it.

582
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,162
- You did not marry?
- I was already married.

583
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,770
It would be a family again.

584
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,403
I served as his father.

585
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,445
On one condition.

586
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,913
I do not want her to know.

587
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,660
It was not me who would tell him.

588
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,629
We agree?

589
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,170
Okay.

590
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,007
How can you marry him?

591
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,214
I do not understand.

592
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,721
They were never married.

593
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:25,030
It does not explain
why marry you.

594
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,773
I knew before.

595
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,744
Before Dad?

596
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,118
Before Dad.

597
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:57,993
Hey, guys!

598
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,767
Engineers are back!

599
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,839
Come on, hurry up.

600
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,109
I hurry.

601
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,413
Hi, Dalglish.

602
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,112
We are waiting for you, you know.

603
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:20,214
Where is everyone?

604
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,121
At the wedding.

605
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,819
Why not you?

606
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,296
It is the marriage of Mr.
Dillon and Mrs. Burn.

607
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,457
Forward, guys!

608
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,983
I want you to be happy.

609
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,684
I am.

610
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,245
- Are you well?
- Yes.

611
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,246
How are you?

612
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,952
Take care of it.

613
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,726
- Bellanger, just dance.
- I arrive.

614
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,426
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.

615
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:09,460
Hello, miss Burn.

616
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,902
Good morning.

617
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,841
- How are you?
- Want to dance?

618
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,207
With pleasure.

619
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,884
How did it go?

620
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:27,253
All right.

621
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,194
It starts quickly.
