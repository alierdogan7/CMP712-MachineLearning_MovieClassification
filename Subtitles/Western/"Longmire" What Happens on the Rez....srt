[Henry grunts]

3
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:21,253
Sorry about smacking you.

4
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:24,805
But you totally buried the lead.

5
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:28,594
If you'd have started with what happened
to Gab, I wouldn't have hit you...

6
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:30,554
so hard.

7
00:00:32,022 --> 00:00:33,939
[grunts]

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,858
Where is Gab?

9
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,727
[Gab] Right behind you.

10
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,148
Do you want a Diet Coke?

11
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,694
- I'm addicted to the stuff.

[grunts]

13
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:52,325
- What's wrong with your ass?
- I got shot.

14
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,661
I have something for that.

15
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,498
Ibuprofen.

16
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:01,759
Reduces swelling.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,006
So... Gab shot a man and needs to lay low.

18
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:10,969
That requires some serious medicine.

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,228
Heather Crazy Dog.

20
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:22,321
Close enough.

21
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:24,107
There you go.

22
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:37,036
After those men attacked you,
your friends tried the sweat?

23
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,081
To call you back?

24
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,875
Did it work?

25
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,553
I wanted it to.

26
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,466
Sometimes it takes more.

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,058
My great-grandmother watched white
soldiers massacre her entire family.

28
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,270
She was raped.

29
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:09,110
She passed this skull down as her
medicine because it's the truth.

30
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,614
Do you have medicine?

31
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,534
I'm not sure what that is.

32
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:22,708
Your medicine... is a power.

33
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:29,797
I can change your name.

34
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:33,719
I can even change your
Social Security number.

35
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:39,641
But only your medicine
can change what's inside.

36
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:42,101
Now you're here.

37
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,564
We'll find your medicine.

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,028
Okay, you, say goodbye.

39
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:56,415
I am not leaving her.

40
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,626
You've got a car parked across the
river where the cops can find it

41
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:02,754
and a truck with your blood in it at home.

42
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:04,374
You want to help her out?

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,628
Go... clean up your mess.

44
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,547
[Gab] She's right.

45
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:15,385
You need to take back Mandy's
car, or she'll turn us in.

46
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,102
[grunting]

47
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,274
Gab, I am so sorry.

48
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,276
Why?

49
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,036
You got me here.

50
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,287
No.

51
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,156
[grunting]

52
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,371
I think I gave you the
idea to shoot that man.

53
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:47,125
When I told you to write to Hector.

54
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,047
I think I already had that idea in my head.

55
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:59,304
You just reminded me
that I had the strength.

56
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:16,946
Thanks for bringing her.

57
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,367
Never come back.

Henry, it's me, again.

60
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,608
Please give me a call
when you get a chance.

61
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:46,858
It's kind of important.

62
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,478
[door opens, cell phone beeps]

63
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,950
Morning.

64
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:57,403
Good morning. [chuckles]

65
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,539
- Coffee?
- Uh, no, thanks.

66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,742
I just need to go grab my, um...

67
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,419
- Pants?
- Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,045
They're over there, so...

69
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:08,832
[chuckles]

70
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm... I'm gonna go get the paper.

71
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,477
Hi.

72
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,930
Hi. Just met your roommate.

73
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:25,939
Um...

74
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,441
You have to get dressed and go.

75
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,360
Whoa, whoa. Not till
I have a cup of coffee.

76
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:30,819
- No.
- Just one cup of coffee.

77
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,398
Otherwise, this feels dirty.

78
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,659
Okay. Okay.

79
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,861
But, um...

80
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,078
Put your clothes on first.

81
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,699
- All right.
- Okay. Okay.

82
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,369
[door closes]

83
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,081
[chuckles]

84
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,209
Met your friend.

85
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:55,093
Yeah.

86
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:57,804
Um, Eamonn. Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:00,132
Eamonn the deputy?

88
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:02,051
Uh...

89
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:06,347
Uh, you can't tell your dad, okay?

90
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:20,528
[whistles]

91
00:06:23,582 --> 00:06:26,618
Oh, uh, sorry, Ferguson. Morning.

92
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:28,252
You all right?

93
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:30,462
- You seem distracted.
- No, I'm good.

94
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:33,416
I just need to talk to the
sheriff before he gets in.

95
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:42,508
Sheriff!

96
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:46,019
Monte? What are you doing here?

97
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,223
I'm sorry to say, but I'm filing
charges against one of your deputies.

98
00:06:50,024 --> 00:06:51,108
Charges? Against who?

99
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,984
Sheriff, I've been
waiting for you to get in.

100
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,362
- You're too late, Zach.
- Whatever this guy has told you...

101
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,864
- Don't you threaten me again.
- Again? I never threatened you.

102
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,618
I don't know what this guy's
problem is, but he's out of control.

103
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,579
I was minding my own business. I
wasn't doing anything to anyone!

104
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,331
He comes busting into my
room without probable cause!

105
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:07,826
Hey!

106
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,620
My office.

107
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,979
[bird cawing]

108
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:52,078
Shit.

109
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,544
[tires squeal]

110
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,726
That's messed up, all
right? He's been watching me.

111
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:12,314
He storms into my room without
permission and with violent intent.

112
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,107
I have witnesses that will tell you

113
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,061
- that he assaulted me.
- All right!

114
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:20,238
Monte, do you want to
file a formal complaint?

115
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,984
- You're damn right I do.
- [Walt] Ferg's in the bullpen.

116
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,071
He'll take your statement.

117
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:36,588
Look, before you say anything, can
I show you what I took from his room?

118
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,883
No! You can't.

119
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:42,761
Anything you have, you got without
a warrant and without probable cause.

120
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:44,054
He was following me.

121
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,348
Paranoia is not probable cause.

122
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:49,309
Paranoia is when there's no factual
basis for fear. Now, in this case...

123
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,354
You mean Monte's case?
Because he has a case.

124
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:55,600
Everything you took from his
room was obtained illegally.

125
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:59,069
Now, this is the last thing I need when
I'm already dealing with two murders.

126
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,105
[knock on door]

127
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,614
- It's Henry.
- Not now.

128
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,525
He says it's important.

129
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:08,412
You wait here.

130
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,489
I don't need you and
Monte in the same room.

131
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,168
Sheriff, what am I supposed to do?

132
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,837
Take his statement.

133
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:18,213
[Trot] Hey! I'm hungry!

134
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:20,291
Yeah, we all have problems.

135
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,387
Henry, what's so important, it can't wait?

136
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,264
My truck has been stolen.

137
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,424
[Walt] When?

138
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:32,143
Hard to say. I have not used
it since the night before last.

139
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:34,563
So sometime in the last 36 hours.

140
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:37,357
I hate to say it, but I think
the person that took your truck

141
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,985
did it because it's yours and
they didn't think you'd call me.

142
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,111
Who do you think...

143
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,773
Gab. She's fleeing a murder charge.

144
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:47,242
- Murder?
- [Walt] Yeah.

145
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:49,070
Tyler Malone died last night.

146
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,001
I do not think Gab
would've stolen my truck.

147
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:59,379
Ferg found evidence of a
getaway vehicle in the woods.

148
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,799
Gab doesn't own a car.
Your truck is missing, so...

149
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,133
That is still quite a leap.

150
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,677
[sighs] I hope so.

151
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:09,590
Meantime, we'll call the state police.
I'll let you know if it turns up.

152
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,136
[tires screech]

153
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:21,443
- Ruby.
- Yeah, state police.

154
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:25,030
Green '58 GMC truck.

155
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:27,699
- Looking up the license plates now.
- Thanks.

156
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,909
Where are you going?

157
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,946
I'm going to talk to the
last person that saw Gab.

158
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,129
[grunts]

159
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:56,262
[Walker] Who the hell are you?

160
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,190
I'm talking to you, asshole.

161
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:02,026
What are you doing with this car?

162
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,235
Nothing. I was just walking by.

163
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:06,105
I saw you get out.

164
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:09,407
Where's Gab, girl who killed my guys?

165
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:11,409
I really have no idea
what you are talking about.

166
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,370
Gab borrowed the car. You're returning it.

167
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:14,947
You got to know something.

168
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:17,449
Hang on a second.

169
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,918
Don't I know you from somewhere?

170
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,837
I do not think so.

171
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:24,498
No, no. Hey. No, no.

172
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,925
You were at the casino
the other night, right?

173
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:28,468
You were following me and my guys.

174
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,921
I think you are confused.

175
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,926
[grunting]

176
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,346
Confused, huh?

177
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,068
I feel really good about
this, Mr. Blackwolf.

178
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,904
From what you've told me, there's
absolutely grounds for a case here.

179
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,405
[knock on door]

180
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,407
Uh, I'll come meet you
in an hour at the casino.

181
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,776
- Okay. Bye.
- [cellphone beeps]

182
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:54,369
Hey, Punk.

183
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,996
Dad.

184
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:59,117
I was just gonna go outside
and get some... get some air.

185
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,164
Was that...

186
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:09,627
Yeah. Uh, Cady's his daughter. I
didn't... I didn't tell you that?

187
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,302
No, you didn't.

188
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,930
Huh.

189
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:15,348
- I need to know everything.
- About what?

190
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:18,643
About when you saw Gab
yesterday. You said she was alone.

191
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:20,228
Are you sure?

192
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,064
Why wouldn't I be sure?

193
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,440
Was she hurt?

194
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,233
Not that I could tell, no.

195
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,603
Why couldn't you tell?
Was she in a vehicle?

196
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:31,031
No. No, I told you. I-I
saw her walking, and then...

197
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:32,275
Was there one nearby?

198
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:35,069
There may have been one parked.

199
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,157
Could it have been Henry's truck?

200
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,625
What? No.

201
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,044
Good morning, Walt. We got to go.

202
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,914
There's been some sort of a
kerfuffle at Mandy Plitt's house.

203
00:12:47,423 --> 00:12:49,591
Ruby's word, not mine.

204
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:52,920
If you remember anything,
you call me, okay?

205
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:16,952
I don't know what you two have been
doing, but I caught an accomplice.

206
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:18,120
An accomplice to what?

207
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:20,580
- This Indian...
- [groans]

208
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:23,374
- Hey!
- ...either helped Gab murder my guys

209
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,751
or knows where to find her.

210
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:26,544
Back up, Walker.

211
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,589
We don't even know that Gab had
anything to do with Tyler's murder.

212
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,008
Well, you may not, but I do.

213
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,878
Owen here said he saw Gab the
morning after Tyler was shot.

214
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,680
You saw Gab?

215
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:39,724
Right here. She was in a
hurry to borrow Mandy's car.

216
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:41,476
After Mandy said no, she threatened Owen.

217
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:43,971
That ought to tell you
a little bit about her.

218
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,643
What'd Gab say?

219
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:54,447
She told Mandy to hand over the
keys or she'd accuse me of rape

220
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:57,826
and that I'd end up dead...
just like Will and Tyler.

221
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:02,407
Okay, in my book, that's an admission
of murder for both Tyler and Will.

222
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,543
What's he got to do with this?

223
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:09,880
Gab borrowed the car. He returned it.

224
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,209
So he's either in on it or
he knows where to find her.

225
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:15,468
Is that true?

226
00:14:15,469 --> 00:14:17,470
- No.
- Bullshit!

227
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,890
This Indian was following me and my guys.

228
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:22,350
He was there at the casino
the night Tyler that was shot.

229
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:24,811
For all I know, the girl was
laying in the back of the truck

230
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,389
while he was talking to me.

231
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,068
So, you gonna arrest him, Sheriff?

232
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,611
Unfortunately, I can't.

233
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:35,530
See, this is the Res.

234
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:37,615
I got no jurisdiction here.

235
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:39,951
[scoffs] I don't get this. I...

236
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:43,163
What do you got against us? What
did me and my men ever do wrong?

237
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:47,993
Aside from rape and murder,
you all seem like great guys.

238
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:52,589
So, this is... It's just
a goddamn joke to you, huh?

239
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,425
This Indian, he's an accessory to murder.

240
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,670
Even if that's true,
there's nothing I can do.

241
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:02,557
Then I will.

242
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,726
[Walt] You don't have
that authority, either.

243
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,971
He's got to go to the tribal police.

244
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:13,110
Sir, who would you rather
take you to the tribal police?

245
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,813
Me or him?

246
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,678
Out!

247
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,180
[groans]

248
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:43,807
Henry, are you okay?

249
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:47,311
It got a bit physical before you
arrived. I landed on something sharp.

250
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:48,853
What the hell's going on?

251
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,355
I am as confused as you are.

252
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,274
Well, you're sure not as mad as I am.

253
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:54,025
What are you doing in Mandy's car?

254
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,736
The one that Gab borrowed the
morning after the shooting?

255
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:59,864
She asked me to return it for
her this morning as a favor.

256
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:01,158
You saw Gab this morning?

257
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:03,201
No. She called. I do not know from where.

258
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:04,911
Why couldn't she return the car herself?

259
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,038
She did not say. I did not ask.

260
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,832
She said she had parked it at the Red Pony.

261
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,541
When I went down this morning to get it,

262
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,586
that is when I noticed my truck was
missing, and that is when I called you.

263
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:16,840
Do you think it's possible that
when she dropped off Mandy's car,

264
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,125
she took your truck?

265
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,387
It is possible.

266
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,265
You knew Tyler had been
shot. I told you that.

267
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:29,644
It didn't cross your mind that maybe Gab
had done it and she was trying to escape?

268
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,648
I was with Gab yesterday morning.
She was not trying to escape then.

269
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,233
You were with her?

270
00:16:35,234 --> 00:16:37,027
Yes.

271
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:38,903
We took a walk.

272
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:41,440
Ask your daughter. She saw us both.

273
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:44,860
Cady saw you?

274
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,990
Yes.

275
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,170
Get back in.

276
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:56,796
Why? So you can yell at me some more?

277
00:16:56,797 --> 00:17:00,175
There's clearly no point.
You've said all you're gonna say.

278
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,344
So what, then, are you
going to take me to Mathias?

279
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm not taking you to Mathias.

280
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:05,555
Then I would rather walk.

281
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:07,299
[Vic] Henry, you're hurt.

282
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:12,263
Best thing for an injury is to walk it off.

283
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:35,702
So, did you really hit Monte?

284
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:37,503
Not on purpose.

285
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,706
Well, I'm sure he was asking for it.

286
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:43,961
How screwed do you think I am?

287
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:48,014
Ruby, call Cady. Tell her to
come here as soon as possible.

288
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,133
Okay.

289
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,428
Ferg, do you have Monte's statement?

290
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,188
Uh, yeah. I got it right here.

291
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,057
- But I just want to s...
- Let me see it.

292
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,908
I'm not sure which is
more surprising to me...

293
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:10,995
the fact that Cady Longmire has
voluntarily come to pay me a visit

294
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:15,033
or that she's friends
with Calvin Blackwolf.

295
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:18,462
- I represent Mr. Blackwolf.
- In what?

296
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,546
[Cady] In the matter of
his wrongful dismissal.

297
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:23,758
Wrongful dismissal? You were fired?

298
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,842
What happened?

299
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:27,053
I'm here to ask you the same question.

300
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:28,430
You're his employer.

301
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:29,389
That's true.

302
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,476
But I don't handle day-to-day
personnel decisions on the floor.

303
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,478
- And that would be?
- [door opens]

304
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,763
Malachi Strand.

305
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:40,525
Why did Malachi fire you, Calvin?

306
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:44,404
He, uh... He said I was missing
shifts. But that's not true.

307
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:48,492
Every time big tippers came to the table,
Malachi would tell me to go take a break.

308
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,654
I needed those tips. It's not fair.

309
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:54,122
And you complained to him?

310
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,499
He did.

311
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
And he was fired.

312
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,628
My client believes that this was
about Malachi playing favorites.

313
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:04,875
But I think Malachi's behavior could
suggest even more egregious improprieties.

314
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:08,886
"Egregious improprieties."

315
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:12,223
All the self-righteous hostility
one expects from a Longmire,

316
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:15,720
but with notably more elegant vocabulary.

317
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:19,356
You are free to treat this
like a joke, Mr. Nighthorse,

318
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:22,108
but you have 24 hours to
respond to my client's complaint.

319
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,562
After which time, we will be filing suit.

320
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:26,522
Indeed.

321
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:33,362
Well, I will take all of
this under consideration.

322
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:35,781
I'm sure you will.

323
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,041
So, do I get to defend myself?

324
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:49,253
You read this?

325
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,757
Is it all true?

326
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:56,226
Well, yes. But...

327
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:59,597
Then the "but" doesn't
really matter, Zachary.

328
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:06,110
I'm sorry, but you can't storm
into somebody's room without cause,

329
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:08,530
steal their property, and hit them.

330
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:11,074
- That was an accident.
- [Walt] Well, I'm sure it was.

331
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,527
But it should never have happened.

332
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:17,197
Well, I promise...

333
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,375
I won't make another mistake like that.

334
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:21,709
[Walt] But you already have.

335
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,380
You got into a fight at the oil
field your first week on the job.

336
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,707
Now this.

337
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:31,670
That's two physical altercations
in such a short time.

338
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:35,181
You once told me...

339
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:40,645
that the best way to stop a problem...

340
00:20:40,646 --> 00:20:43,223
was to get there before
it becomes a problem.

341
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,479
I'm sorry, but that's
what I got to do here.

342
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:55,368
You don't have to say any more.

343
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,572
Well, unfortunately, I do.

344
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,242
I need your badge and gun.

345
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:29,770
Sorry I screwed up, Sheriff.

346
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,481
I know.

347
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,692
So am I.

348
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,402
[door opens]

349
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:06,390
[door closes]

350
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:11,395
Hey.

351
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:14,481
What's up?

352
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:20,828
I understand the rest of
the world disappointing me.

353
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,539
But you?

354
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,290
What are you talking about?

355
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,916
You lied to my face.

356
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,244
Twice.

357
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,381
You saw Henry walking
with Gab yesterday morning.

358
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:36,587
And yet you told me again
and again that she was alone.

359
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:46,103
How did you find out?

360
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:47,271
Henry told me.

361
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,557
He did?

362
00:22:49,316 --> 00:22:52,477
Well, if he was willing to tell you,
then obviously, he has nothing to hide.

363
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,899
He only told me because he was cornered.

364
00:22:58,534 --> 00:23:03,238
And you only confirmed it...
because I caught you in a lie.

365
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,326
Why did you feel you had to lie?

366
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:13,874
I thought that maybe Henry
was involved with... something.

367
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,377
But I was obviously
just being overdramatic.

368
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,756
What did you think he did?

369
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:26,470
Okay.

370
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:30,022
We've gotten to a place where I'm
uncomfortable answering these questions.

371
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:31,566
Cady, this is serious.

372
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,611
I have reason to believe he's
involved in a serious crime.

373
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,946
Which is why I can't talk to you about it.

374
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,698
He is, after all, my client.

375
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:39,990
Ex-client.

376
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,452
Well, we never dissolved the relationship.

377
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:47,123
You're going to use legal technicalities
so you can... you can lie to me?

378
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:50,076
I'm not lying to you. And I'm sorry.

379
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:55,332
But if I tell you things without
Henry's permission, I could be disbarred.

380
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:08,770
- He's not here.
- What do you mean he's not here?

381
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:11,105
Henry Standing Bear is
an accessory to a murder.

382
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:13,399
That's why he's not here. That's a felony.

383
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,110
I'm not authorized to
deal with cases like that.

384
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:17,987
Strictly misdemeanors around here.

385
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:20,030
- So you let a criminal go.
- [sighs]

386
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:22,199
- Well, that's the flip side.
- Flip side of what?

387
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,994
Well, you and your men can do
whatever you want on the Res

388
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:27,079
without anybody being able to hurt you.

389
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,998
The flip side is when something goes wrong,

390
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,875
there's nobody that can help you, either.

391
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:33,461
So the sheriff's not gonna lift
a finger to find this murderer.

392
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:34,879
You aren't, either.

393
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,715
That doesn't leave me a lot
of goddamn options, does it?

394
00:24:37,716 --> 00:24:39,334
Sure doesn't.

395
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:47,258
[laughs]

396
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:51,771
[Mathias] You were right.
He was here, and he's pissed.

397
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:54,725
Okay, Mathias. Thanks for the update.

398
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:06,236
You fire Zachary?

399
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:08,906
I did.

400
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:11,950
So what was it that he found over there?

401
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:14,293
I don't know.

402
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:16,162
You didn't let him explain himself?

403
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,466
What difference would it make?

404
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,176
I don't know.

405
00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:23,628
But neither do you.

406
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:26,430
Look, I'll admit it.

407
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:29,426
Took me a little while
to warm up to Zachary.

408
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,387
But I think he's a good cop.

409
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:35,140
So do I.

410
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:38,735
So what happens if he was right?

411
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,854
What happens when he's not?

412
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:46,450
What's that tell you and Vic
about how you should do your jobs?

413
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:48,870
Obviously, this is your decision to make.

414
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:51,372
But I think you're making Zach
pay for someone else's crimes.

415
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:53,742
Yes. This is about Branch.

416
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:57,628
That was the last time my
personal feelings about a deputy

417
00:25:57,629 --> 00:25:59,881
led me to make the wrong decision.

418
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:01,291
But Zach's not Branch.

419
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:07,931
Branch was always trying
to prove something.

420
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:10,508
It was always about Branch.

421
00:26:11,268 --> 00:26:12,677
But Zach...

422
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:16,848
I just think he really
wants to help people.

423
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:20,685
You might be right.

424
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,190
I believe his intentions are good.

425
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:29,360
But I have to think about the consequences.

426
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,447
I've made my decision.

427
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:42,457
[door closes]

428
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:48,379
[Henry inhales sharply]

429
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:51,758
[knock on door]

430
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:57,848
Come in!

431
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:12,946
Jacob?

432
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,992
Wow.

433
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,211
You must really love the Red Pony...

434
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:25,750
to willingly live in a place like this.

435
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:31,555
And to stay on, even after
you got bought out by Malachi.

436
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:34,017
"Bought out" is not how I
would put it. He tricked me.

437
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:36,720
Well, he tricked me, too.

438
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:46,070
I thought that Malachi's past mistakes
were attributable to his circumstances

439
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:51,193
and that if someone like me believed
in him, his best self would come out.

440
00:27:52,452 --> 00:27:56,948
But there may be no best
self left in the man.

441
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:01,411
Jacob, why are you here?

442
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:08,092
I have mounting evidence

443
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:13,305
that Malachi has been using the casino
as a base for illegal activities.

444
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:16,301
He's threatening everything
that I have set up.

445
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:18,561
And I need your help.

446
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:21,188
Illegal activities are more
of a Sheriff Longmire thing.

447
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:22,398
Why not go to him?

448
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,767
Well...

449
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:31,024
Because... he hates me...

450
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,076
and doesn't trust me.

451
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:34,326
And you think I do?

452
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:35,570
Maybe not.

453
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:41,326
But in the end, Henry, I think
that you and I want the same thing.

454
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:47,172
Betterment of our people,
achieved by our people.

455
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:52,302
Walt would see my trouble with Malachi
as an opportunity to destroy my casino.

456
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:58,017
You might see it as an
opportunity to save your bar.

457
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:00,310
Just when I was beginning
to see you as an idealist,

458
00:29:00,311 --> 00:29:02,105
the pragmatic negotiator comes out.

459
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,940
[Nighthorse] Ah, yeah, well...

460
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:07,102
we both like being our own boss.

461
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:14,192
If you help me keep my business,
I'll help you get yours back.

462
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:18,746
What are you proposing I do?

463
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:20,991
Malachi's been stealing money.

464
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:26,204
He's got to hide it somewhere.

465
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,172
I'm guessing it's here.

466
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:30,758
- Money laundering.
- Yeah.

467
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,003
If you could help me prove that...

468
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:38,591
they wouldn't let him run
this place from prison.

469
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:43,096
Think about it...

470
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:46,266
Henry.

471
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:56,651
[knock on door]

472
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,446
Monte, can I come in?

473
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:02,873
Sure.

474
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:05,827
I'm gonna leave the door open
in case things get out of hand.

475
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:12,466
[Walt] I want you to know that
we take these charges seriously.

476
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,586
Zachary's been let go for his behavior.

477
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:18,506
I'm here to apologize personally.

478
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:20,342
Wow.

479
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:23,435
Okay. Apology accepted.

480
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:26,856
Knowing what a harsh
outcome this is for Zachary,

481
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:29,192
I wanted to suggest that
maybe you find your way

482
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:31,477
to dropping the charges against him.

483
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:37,942
What's in it for me if I do?

484
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,112
Nothing.

485
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:44,040
[chuckles] Ah, it was worth a try.

486
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:48,078
Bribery would have made a really
juicy addition to the complaint.

487
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:49,670
What complaint?

488
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:50,914
This one.

489
00:30:57,804 --> 00:31:00,973
You're suing me for your
little tiff with Zachary?

490
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:03,767
Or is this just your way of getting
back at me for not hiring you?

491
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:06,346
I'm not the one suing you.
I'm just the investigator.

492
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,433
Who's suing me?

493
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,559
Barlow Connally.

494
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:21,368
[Ruby] Frankly, I don't care...

495
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:22,786
[Walker] No, I don't!

496
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:25,372
[Ruby] Yelling is not
gonna change my answer, sir!

497
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:27,457
It's just gonna make you look foolish!

498
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,668
- Just call him on his cell phone!
- He doesn't have one.

499
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:32,588
- Bullshit! Who doesn't have a cell phone?
- Watch your language, sir!

500
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:33,756
There he is.

501
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,258
Time's up, Sheriff.

502
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,759
Make an appointment.

503
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,003
How 'bout instead of
that, I set a court date?

504
00:31:39,637 --> 00:31:41,597
You've been holding Trot for two days.

505
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,766
- It's actually only been 36 hours.
- Close enough.

506
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,269
As far as I know, you haven't
charged him with anything yet.

507
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,895
- We've got 48 hours to do that.
- Right.

508
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:51,274
But if you haven't charged him, I can only
assume it's because of lack of evidence.

509
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:54,484
And we both know that you're suddenly
not gonna find some in the next 12 hours.

510
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:56,361
Not when the actual
killer's still out there.

511
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:58,530
- What do you want, Walker?
- What do you think I want?

512
00:31:58,531 --> 00:32:00,449
You charge him or you release him.

513
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,203
If you do neither, I've got lawyers at
Newett drawing up paperwork right now

514
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:06,163
to drop a wrongful-arrest
suit against you.

515
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:08,415
Wrongful arrest? Based on what?

516
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:13,170
Abuse of power, corruption, colluding with
tribal police to conceal the real suspects

517
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:17,133
while intimidating and
harassing me and my men.

518
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:19,043
Shall I go on?

519
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:39,696
I hope you all realize next time you try
to hang false charges on me and my guys,

520
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:41,274
not gonna be so patient.

521
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:45,945
Okay, Walt.

522
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:48,789
I'm sure you got a good
reason, but why would you...

523
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,375
Because now is not the time for
me to be fielding any questions

524
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:54,579
about corruption, abuse
of power, or intimidation.

525
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:56,706
Why not?

526
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:01,294
Because I'm already being sued for
the wrongful death of Barlow Connally.

527
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,089
[Ruby] Walt, Walt.

528
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:08,017
Not so fast.

529
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:12,355
So, Ruby said, uh, Steve
Rosato saw the abandoned truck

530
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,564
in a lane behind his store.

531
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:16,400
Sounded like it could be Henry's.

532
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:18,610
You think Gab is somewhere around here?

533
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,063
[Walt] Don't know.

534
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:25,034
You worried about that lawsuit at all?

535
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:27,536
I mean, I know that Monte took
a lot of stuff out of context,

536
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:30,164
but there's some pretty
damning stuff in there.

537
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:31,915
Why should I be worried?

538
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:35,336
The feds cleared me. It's
just gonna be a hassle.

539
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:37,914
These lawsuits eat up a lot of time.

540
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,257
Yeah.

541
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:42,377
It's a bad time to be shorthanded.

542
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:49,516
[grunts]

543
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:52,436
About that, uh, I was thinking,

544
00:33:52,437 --> 00:33:54,855
instead of going through
a whole search again,

545
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:57,934
you think Eamonn might be
interested in taking that job?

546
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,444
Uh...

547
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:03,607
I don't, uh... I don't really
think that that's the best idea.

548
00:34:04,115 --> 00:34:05,241
Why?

549
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:06,692
Um...

550
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:11,573
Because Eamonn and I are in a relationship.

551
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:15,751
Um... a sexual one.

552
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:18,045
We're sleeping together.

553
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,581
Oh.

554
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,590
Oh?

555
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,460
Seriously? That's your response?

556
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,714
What do you want me to say?

557
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:31,259
I don't know.

558
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:36,556
"Wow, I had no idea," or, "How
long has that been going on?"

559
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,524
It's none of my business.

560
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:42,194
Yeah, Walt, you know... [sighs]

561
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:44,447
We used to be close, you
know, so close, in fact,

562
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:47,074
that my ex-husband thought we
were too close, and so did Lizzie.

563
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:50,403
And everybody else always thought that
there was something going on between us.

564
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:59,579
You know, it's not like you actually
encouraged me to stay married.

565
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:03,840
And then, you think that Eamonn is
flirting with me, so you push him away,

566
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:06,260
and then all of a sudden you
start dating the psychiatrist,

567
00:35:06,261 --> 00:35:07,795
and you want to hire Eamonn?

568
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:10,089
Why?

569
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,175
Feel guilty?

570
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:16,895
Please don't walk away from me.

571
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:18,647
I'm not walking away from you.

572
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,899
I'm walking away from
that truck. It's a Chevy.

573
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,810
It's not Henry's.

574
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:34,489
So, what exactly is the nature of
your relationship with Dr. Monaghan?

575
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:40,286
The exact nature of my relationship
is none of your business.

576
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:43,623
It is my business, Walt.

577
00:35:44,674 --> 00:35:49,045
Whether you like it or not,
your life, it impacts mine.

578
00:35:58,604 --> 00:35:59,889
[sighs]

579
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:16,330
[Ruby] Walt, Dr. Monaghan called.

580
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:19,325
She needs you to get over
to the church right away.

581
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:25,831
[police radio chatter]

582
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:28,668
[Donna] Thank you so much. Yeah.

583
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,679
[sighs] Oh, thank God you're here.

584
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,181
Is that your van?

585
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:38,352
Yeah. I, uh, came out after my
group, and... and it was on fire.

586
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:41,564
And the fire department said
that someone broke the window

587
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,358
and threw a Molotov cocktail inside, so...

588
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:45,560
Jesus.

589
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:48,320
You think it was your patient?

590
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:53,576
Well, i-i-it's hard for me to imagine
any other explanation right now.

591
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,319
What's your patient's name?

592
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,582
I'm sorry. I'm just not really
comfortable giving you that information.

593
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,791
I don't think you're bound
by doctor-patient privilege

594
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:03,460
in the face of a violent act like this.

595
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:04,878
No. It's...

596
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:07,797
This patient hasn't made
their last four sessions,

597
00:37:07,798 --> 00:37:11,218
so I'm completely in the dark as
to their state of mind right now.

598
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:16,006
So, someone lit your van on fire, and
you don't want to tell us who it is?

599
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:17,974
Yes. That's right.

600
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,352
[Walt] Well, I don't
think you should go home

601
00:37:20,353 --> 00:37:22,687
till we know that this
patient is no longer a threat.

602
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:24,481
You got somewhere to stay?

603
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,358
Uh, yeah, I can...

604
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:27,984
You should just stay with Walt.

605
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:30,362
It'll be a lot safer for
you with a man around.

606
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:32,649
[police radio chatter]

607
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,251
How did you get in?

608
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:45,877
Boyfriend gave me a key.

609
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:48,289
What do you want?

610
00:37:49,173 --> 00:37:50,625
To talk.

611
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:56,172
Where is your, uh, friend Gab?

612
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:58,132
I don't know.

613
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:00,677
[groans]

614
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:02,720
[coughs]

615
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:05,682
Aah!

616
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,733
Aah!

617
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:11,354
[coughs, groaning]

618
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:17,360
You tell me where she is, and this'll stop.

619
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:20,697
[grunts] No, it won't.

620
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:23,032
Aah!

621
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:31,415
[rock music playing]

622
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:39,298
Hey.

623
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:41,467
Hey.

624
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,556
You know, you were right.

625
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:48,850
About Monte.

626
00:38:50,901 --> 00:38:53,778
He's trying to dig up dirt
on Walt for a civil suit.

627
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:56,148
Monte's bad news.

628
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:59,569
I saw the stuff you found in his room.

629
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:02,912
You know, the transcript
of my conversation with him?

630
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:06,958
It was totally taken out of
context to make Walt look bad.

631
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,670
Monte's really trying to take Walt down.

632
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:11,171
What are you gonna do?

633
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:14,257
Actually, I thought I might
take another run at Walt.

634
00:39:14,258 --> 00:39:15,960
- Get him to take you back.
- Nah.

635
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:20,047
That ship has sailed.

636
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,509
Are you drinking?

637
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:27,346
There's no reason not to anymore. Hmm?

638
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:31,768
I can think of a bunch.

639
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:33,902
All right, look. I'm gonna take you home.

640
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:35,028
No, I'm good.

641
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:36,279
Hey.

642
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,822
Come on, man.

643
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:38,900
Come on.

644
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:43,370
I'm tired of people not listening to me!

645
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:45,949
Give me your goddamn keys!

646
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,338
You know, it's, uh...

647
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:06,636
It's been a long time since there's
been something positive in my life.

648
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:12,224
I thought this job was going to be that.

649
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,612
I just got sick of cops always
getting there after the crime,

650
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:20,650
after someone had been raped or murdered.

651
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:26,121
And I thought that I could be the guy

652
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:29,659
who could stop those things from
happening in the first place.

653
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,453
Look, man, I'm...

654
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:38,208
I'm really sorry... I gave you such
a hard time when you first showed up.

655
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,712
You didn't deserve it.

656
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:47,267
It's good, man.

657
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:48,761
It's all good.

658
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,272
What are you doing?

659
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:57,611
Well, since you're driving,
I can have another drink.

660
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:59,063
Bartender!

661
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:04,743
I've been checking with
the state police hourly,

662
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,830
and they have absolutely
nothing on Henry's truck.

663
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:11,207
They put out an alert to all
the counties, other states?

664
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:14,294
It's not their first
stolen vehicle, Walter.

665
00:41:14,295 --> 00:41:17,422
What about Gab? Anyone respond
to the missing-persons alert?

666
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:18,916
- No.
- [door opens]

667
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:22,594
- [Mandy] Please.
- [Ruby] Oh, Lord.

668
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:24,429
You have to help her.

669
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,597
Mandy, what happened?

670
00:41:25,598 --> 00:41:28,885
I didn't tell him anything, I swear.
I don't know anything. But you...

671
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:34,515
You have to find Gab before he does.

672
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,441
Who?

673
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:37,935
Who did this?

674
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:40,987
[Malachi] Mr. Browning.

675
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:43,148
It's a pleasure to see you again.

676
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:45,408
[Walker] I need to find a girl.

677
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:48,411
Oh? For you this time or one
of your [chuckles] colleagues?

678
00:41:48,412 --> 00:41:50,664
Not that kind of girl.
Her name's Gab Langton.

679
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,165
She killed one of my guys.

680
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:54,710
Well, I am not a bounty hunter.

681
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:58,497
If I don't find her, they're gonna
pin the murder on one of my boys.

682
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:00,249
I can't have that.

683
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,927
If Trot goes down, he
might take me with him.

684
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:08,390
And our lucrative arrangement where
I overpay you to take care of my guys,

685
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:09,683
that's over.

686
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:11,685
[Malachi] Do we have
anything other than a name?

687
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:14,312
[Walker] Make, model, and license
number of her getaway vehicle,

688
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:17,566
and her accomplice is an Indian
by the name of Henry Standing Bear.

689
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:20,985
[laughs] Hank Standing Bear's involved?

690
00:42:20,986 --> 00:42:23,572
Well, now I am interested.

691
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:26,241
- Well, the sheriff sure isn't.
- [chuckles]

692
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:29,244
Walter Longmire's not going to help you.

693
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:30,780
He's Hank's best friend.

694
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,585
But tell you what, I'll put
the word out to the brotherhood.

695
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:42,125
And if any of them has seen
Gab or Hank, I'll let you know.

696
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:50,174
I know you know where Gab is.

697
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,843
I know you helped her escape.

698
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:56,346
Now you need to tell me where she is.

699
00:42:57,106 --> 00:42:58,474
Walt...

700
00:42:59,817 --> 00:43:02,186
you tried to get justice for her...

701
00:43:03,153 --> 00:43:04,814
and could not.

702
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:11,695
And now, just maybe, she found
the only justice available to her.

703
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:17,960
Why are you working so
hard to punish her for that?

704
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:21,671
Because if I don't get to her first,

705
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:26,585
Walker Browning will hunt
her down and kill her.

706
00:43:28,846 --> 00:43:33,050
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

707
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:35,594
Where's Gab?

708
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:55,998
[rock music playing]

709
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:57,248
Hey.

710
00:43:57,249 --> 00:43:58,408
Hi.

711
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,205
I promised you a home-cooked
meal and I never delivered, so...

712
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,922
Oh, you delivered.

713
00:44:03,923 --> 00:44:05,256
[both chuckle]

714
00:44:05,257 --> 00:44:09,052
Also, this is a restaurant,
so not really home-cooked.

715
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:10,053
Ah.

716
00:44:10,054 --> 00:44:15,475
Well, the guy who cooks here... Henry...
also lives here, so it is his home.

717
00:44:15,476 --> 00:44:17,686
Well, that's thin, but I'll allow it.

718
00:44:17,687 --> 00:44:19,138
[laughs]

719
00:44:20,648 --> 00:44:22,024
[clears throat]

720
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,274
Mm.

721
00:44:23,275 --> 00:44:27,696
Also, I wanted to let you know that
Walt brought up the idea of hiring you.

722
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:30,114
And I know that I should have
spoken to you about it first,

723
00:44:30,115 --> 00:44:32,609
but I told him that it
just couldn't happen.

724
00:44:34,996 --> 00:44:37,614
Yeah, you definitely should've
spoken to me about that first.

725
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:41,250
Well, yeah, but I mean that it
wouldn't have mattered anyway

726
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,963
'cause we can't work together
if we're in a relationship.

727
00:44:44,964 --> 00:44:47,256
All I did was pick you up at the hospital,

728
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:51,712
and now we're in a relationship and
you're making career decisions for me?

729
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:55,883
Vic, I told you I liked it here.

730
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:58,977
And my current boss turns out
to be ethically challenged,

731
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:00,436
something I helped expose.

732
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,981
So I don't know how long
I'm going to be in that job.

733
00:45:02,982 --> 00:45:05,101
- I'm sorry, Eamonn. I...
- Are you?

734
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:06,776
Because...

735
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:10,780
'Cause it... It feels like
I'm just some kind of pawn

736
00:45:10,781 --> 00:45:14,283
in whatever weird dynamic
you and Walt have going on.

737
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:15,785
That... That is not true.

738
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:16,786
Really?

739
00:45:16,787 --> 00:45:18,788
He fired me because he was jealous,

740
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:23,543
and now you tell him not to hire me
because you want to make him jealous?

741
00:45:23,544 --> 00:45:25,162
[scoffs]

742
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:33,219
Okay, so I'll admit that I didn't
handle this situation particularly well.

743
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,842
But none of that means that
I don't really like you.

744
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,440
You know, Vic? Ah.

745
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:46,983
I like you, too.

746
00:45:46,984 --> 00:45:50,236
But before there's gonna
be any kind of "us,"

747
00:45:50,237 --> 00:45:52,689
you got to figure out
what's going on with you.

748
00:46:30,987 --> 00:46:32,271
Gab?

749
00:46:59,015 --> 00:47:00,216
Gab?

750
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:10,017
Hey.

751
00:47:11,027 --> 00:47:15,613
So, here it is, the great demon
your mother fought so hard against.

752
00:47:15,614 --> 00:47:16,732
Christina.

753
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:20,284
It's not that bad, is it?

754
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:21,911
Well, my client sure seems to like it,

755
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:24,247
so I'm hoping you have
some good news for him.

756
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:26,875
Well, that's not why I asked you to come.

757
00:47:26,876 --> 00:47:27,876
Please, sit.

758
00:47:27,877 --> 00:47:30,128
If we're not talking about
Calvin Blackwolf's job,

759
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:31,838
then we're not talking.

760
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,458
I think you're gonna want to hear this.

761
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:37,878
Please.

762
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:50,065
The profit generated by all this was
never intended to enrich any one person.

763
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:53,193
It is intended to change
the life of the whole tribe.

764
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:56,230
And yet you're the only
one in a Prada suit.

765
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,993
I want to fund the construction of
schools, hospitals, treatment centers.

766
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:05,454
I-I really don't have time for a speech.

767
00:48:05,455 --> 00:48:07,999
Um, I have a complaint I
have to write for my client.

768
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,001
And I would also like to fund you.

769
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:11,669
[chuckles]

770
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,962
Excuse me?

771
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:15,757
Most of our people
don't understand the law.

772
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:17,842
They can't afford lawyers.

773
00:48:17,843 --> 00:48:21,721
But with a properly funded
and managed legal-aid center,

774
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:23,514
we could start to change that.

775
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:26,976
Are you trying to buy me off so that
I'll make Calvin's lawsuit just go away?

776
00:48:26,977 --> 00:48:28,978
Calvin shouldn't have been fired.

777
00:48:28,979 --> 00:48:30,688
His job's still here if he wants it,

778
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:34,684
along with back pay and
an extra week's vacation.

779
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,987
What I would like, Cady,

780
00:48:37,988 --> 00:48:42,901
is for everyone in Cheyenne Nation
to have access to representation.

781
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,362
And I'd like you to provide it.

782
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:52,869
I was raised by a white woman.

783
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:58,091
And I know there are a
few special ones out there.

784
00:48:58,092 --> 00:49:00,336
So call my office if you're interested.

785
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:16,893
[Walt] Gab?

786
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:23,608
You can't come in here.

787
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:28,871
You're supposed to fast
for at least 24 hours first.

788
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:31,333
Gab, you need to come with me.

789
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:33,293
We have to leave now.

790
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:35,170
Are you here to arrest me?

791
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:37,255
I'm here to protect you.

792
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:39,341
There's another man
who's trying to kill you.

793
00:49:39,342 --> 00:49:41,050
Why?

794
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:44,887
He thinks you killed his
friend, the oil worker.

795
00:49:44,888 --> 00:49:47,682
And if you're not around
to tell your story,

796
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,968
he can pin a second murder on you, too.

797
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:52,388
I don't care.

798
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:56,024
I wish I did kill them both.

799
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,859
I know.

800
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,569
But if you let them blame
you for both murders,

801
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,780
that means they get away with everything.

802
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:04,691
And they can do it again.

803
00:50:10,664 --> 00:50:15,077
[Gab] Marilyn says this medicine wheel
is like a microphone to our ancestors.

804
00:50:15,544 --> 00:50:18,129
I've been asking for their guidance.

805
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,458
It's hard to believe they would
send a white sheriff to help me.

806
00:50:29,808 --> 00:50:32,761
Spirit helpers can take on strange forms.

807
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:36,681
Maybe this time your ancestors
just worked through Henry.

808
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:46,816
He drew me this map.

809
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,239
Do you think he would've sent
me if I wasn't on your side?

810
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,553
Well, isn't this a coincidence?

811
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:18,022
[Walt] Out of my way, Walker.

812
00:51:18,023 --> 00:51:19,391
[Walker] All right.

813
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:22,193
As long as you leave Gab with me.

814
00:51:22,194 --> 00:51:24,904
- I can't do that.
- [Walker] Of course you can.

815
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:31,035
Look, I know we've had our differences,
but we're both just doing the same thing.

816
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:33,746
- No, we're not.
- [Walker] Sure, we are.

817
00:51:33,747 --> 00:51:35,740
We're looking out for our friends.

818
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:39,668
I'm doing right by Tyler,
who this girl shot and killed.

819
00:51:39,669 --> 00:51:42,297
And you're trying to protect your pal Henry

820
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:46,001
from getting busted being her accomplice.

821
00:51:46,676 --> 00:51:48,587
I'll keep your secret.

822
00:51:51,056 --> 00:51:53,091
Leave the girl with me.

823
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:55,810
Or what?

824
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,304
Gonna shoot us?

825
00:51:58,314 --> 00:52:00,807
[scoffs] I'm not gonna shoot you.

826
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:03,192
He is.

827
00:52:03,193 --> 00:52:06,062
- [gun cocks]
- Put the gun down, Sheriff.

828
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:31,213
And the handgun.

829
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:45,352
You don't think killing a
sheriff will catch up with you?

830
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:47,778
We're on the Res.

831
00:52:47,779 --> 00:52:51,866
All kinds of crazy shit happens on
the Res that nobody has to pay for.

832
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:53,151
[gunshot]

833
00:52:57,747 --> 00:52:59,616
[gunshot]

834
00:53:13,138 --> 00:53:14,548
[groans]

835
00:53:18,352 --> 00:53:20,011
Aah!

836
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,485
Gab?

837
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:39,656
Hey.

838
00:53:40,374 --> 00:53:41,790
Where is she?

839
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:43,952
Who? Gab?

840
00:53:45,003 --> 00:53:46,170
She's gone.

841
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,423
I know that. Where did she go?

842
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,383
She hasn't gone anywhere.

843
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:51,835
She's gone.

844
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,257
As, uh... in, Gab is no longer Gab.

845
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:00,935
Who is she?

846
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:02,805
It's more like, "What is she?"

847
00:54:04,314 --> 00:54:09,185
She's been transformed
into a red-tailed hawk.

848
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:11,814
Just now?

849
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,319
She's always been a hawk in spirit.

850
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:25,410
Now she's a hawk in reality.

851
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:29,164
Did you fire that shot?

852
00:54:34,553 --> 00:54:36,220
What shot?

853
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:38,882
[Walt] Somebody just
killed a man down there.

854
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:41,267
Saved my life.

855
00:54:41,268 --> 00:54:42,803
Gab's, too.

856
00:54:45,105 --> 00:54:46,765
Good deal.

857
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:50,226
Yeah. I suppose it is.

858
00:54:57,742 --> 00:54:59,820
Are you gonna go after her?

859
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,700
There's no point.

860
00:55:07,169 --> 00:55:12,165
If she's a hawk, that's
outside my jurisdiction.

861
00:55:25,646 --> 00:55:27,764
[hawk screeches]

862
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,127
Hey. Look what I found.

863
00:55:59,555 --> 00:56:01,764
Thanks. I have been
looking all over for it.

864
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:03,383
I bet.

865
00:56:08,689 --> 00:56:10,682
How can I repay you?

866
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:12,768
With blood.

867
00:56:14,903 --> 00:56:16,855
Hector.

868
00:56:35,173 --> 00:56:37,751
So, do you want to talk about any of it?

869
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:40,886
Maybe.

870
00:56:40,887 --> 00:56:42,388
Eventually.

871
00:56:42,389 --> 00:56:44,466
Not now.

872
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,718
