00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:17,931
Well, you'll forgive me
if I don't take your
word for it, won't you?

(GROANS)

187
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,829
Don't do it!

188
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,662
Shit!

00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,634
Son of a bitch!

191
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,561
Let's get out of here.

192
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,080
Fuck!

193
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,209
Hey.

194
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:49,773
Dad!

195
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:52,041
Dad! Dad!

196
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,561
Dad!
DAD MASON: Ben?

197
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:58,097
Yeah, he's...
He's okay.

198
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:01,551
What?

199
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:03,253
What?

200
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,254
What?

00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,939
No, no Spanish, Dad.

204
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,441
Come on, no Spanish.

what we got, boys!

(GROANS)

214
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:35,478
A good man is dead!

215
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,369
Do you remember
when we got these?

216
00:23:42,437 --> 00:23:44,237
I saw an opportunity.

217
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,376
Different kind of outlaw.

218
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:56,983
Yeah.

219
00:24:08,028 --> 00:24:09,563
Pick it up.

220
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,638
You'll draw?

221
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,056
I'll draw.

222
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,688
Hardly seems fair.

223
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:44,481
Anytime.

224
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:50,353
You don't have to do this.

225
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:10,289
We plan everything
in great fuckin' detail.

226
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:14,027
No unnecessary violence.

227
00:25:14,094 --> 00:25:15,595
Any questions?

228
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,334
Hell, what are we
gonna do with him?

229
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:23,536
Feed him to the pigs.

230
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:25,388
Whose?

231
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,040
What?

232
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:32,329
Well, almost all of us here
got hogs and no offense,

233
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:36,032
but he'd make some
good eatin' for 'em.

234
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,568
We'll figure it.

235
00:25:39,403 --> 00:25:41,287
Well, that'd be great.

(GROANS)

237
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,682
Slow down now.

238
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,267
They did you
a good one there.

239
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,869
It's just a scratch.

240
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:59,322
Real sorry about Dad.

241
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:03,043
Me, too.

242
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:05,862
Maybe they did get me
pretty good.

243
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,369
John Mason.

246
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:20,460
I'm really sorry
to hear about Dad.

247
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,180
Thanks.

248
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:26,766
Not half as sorry as
those masked assholes
are gonna be.

249
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:30,520
It's good
to see you, John.

250
00:26:31,472 --> 00:26:32,706
You remember Alice?

251
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,991
Been tendin' to you
for three days.
Mmm.

252
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,027
I'm gonna keep tendin'.

253
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,945
He needs to rest.

254
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:41,631
Just a couple hours.

255
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,667
Come on.
All right.

256
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:48,538
You mind if I keep this
for mendin'?

257
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,039
Ah.

258
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,442
Thanks, I don't think
it'll be necessary.

259
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,478
Oh, it's not necessary?

260
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,780
Well, how about
I be the one to decide
what's necessary around here

261
00:26:57,848 --> 00:27:00,350
when it comes to textiles
and you just say,

262
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,452
"Thank you.
Thank you very much."

263
00:27:03,971 --> 00:27:05,305
Thank you.

264
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:08,642
Very much.

266
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,542
ALICE: But you don't know
for certain.

267
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,295
RUDD: Well, I suppose
not for certain.

268
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,997
Well, they've always granted
extensions in the past.

269
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,299
RUDD: Yeah, well,
not anymore.

270
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:51,867
Standard Rail says
they want it all.

271
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:54,471
ALICE: I just sent
a telegram asking for
another six months.

272
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:57,673
Alice.
No, where are we
gonna get $5,000?

273
00:27:57,741 --> 00:27:59,175
I'll figure it out.

274
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:01,944
Hey.

275
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:03,580
Oh, look
who's finally up!

276
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,281
Good morning.
Mason.

277
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,949
It smells great!

278
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:09,619
Be my guest.

(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

280
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:27,303
Well...

281
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:34,344
What's going on, boss?

282
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,147
He don't know nothin'.

283
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:39,248
No?

284
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,352
It's fine.

285
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,726
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

286
00:28:51,428 --> 00:28:52,679
In private?

287
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,385
Come on in, man.

288
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,393
Phew!

289
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:13,666
(CLEARS THROAT)

290
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:22,008
Well?

291
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:28,181
Do you know what happened
between John Mason
and his father?

292
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:29,165
His mother.

293
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,605
Dad Mason lost his wife,
John's mother.

294
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,908
A few years later
he met a woman.

295
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,977
Oh.

296
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,747
And John didn't approve.

297
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:46,766
He was still broken up
over his mother, yeah.

298
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,502
Hmm.

299
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,173
The new woman,
was she Spanish?

300
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:57,293
She was Mexican.

301
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:00,013
"She was Mexican"?

302
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,383
She died of consumption
a few years later.

303
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:06,418
Oh, bad luck.

304
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,570
Yeah, bad luck.

305
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:15,161
What's this?

306
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:18,781
Oh, that's the rail workers'
salary comin' in.

307
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,301
We gotta get that money
up to Canada, so...

308
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:24,320
The money's here now?

309
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:26,623
Well, no, I mean,
they don't tell us when
it's comin' in exactly

310
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,291
because, you know,
that's for our own protection

311
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,678
they say because, you know,
road agents and bandits

312
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:34,947
they'd do just about
anything to get their
hands on that kinda money.

313
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:36,049
So...

314
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,922
I would like to ask
for your sister's hand
in marriage.

315
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:47,059
Well, no kidding!

316
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,829
No, I'm not kidding.

317
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:51,297
Did you think
I was kidding?

318
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,766
No, Ben,
I just can't believe
it took you this long.

319
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,087
Oh, well?

320
00:30:57,154 --> 00:31:00,940
Well, if she'll have you,
you're all right with me.

321
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,208
I'm just glad
I haven't killed you.

322
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:05,778
(CHUCKLES)

323
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,533
(LAUGHS) Thank you.

324
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:13,903
Okay.

325
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,188
All right, well,
I gotta go pick
somethin' up

326
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:17,140
from the depot
at Grey Falls!

327
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:18,824
Good luck!

328
00:31:18,892 --> 00:31:20,076
Yeah.

329
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,315
Hey.

330
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,555
So, why did you come
all the way back here
to Promise?

331
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,828
What's the story
with you and Ben?

332
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,699
Ben McClure is a friend.

333
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,135
Now he's my friend, too.

334
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,840
I like to think that
you are my friend,

335
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:55,779
we're just, uh, different
kind of friends, so.

336
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:02,569
(GUN FIRES)

337
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:03,986
Oh, shit.

338
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:09,709
It helps me sleep.

339
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,630
Yup.

340

00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:27,993
Alice told me
I'd find you here.

343
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,989
Well, that's not bad
for shootin' leaves.

344
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:41,808
Let's see how you do
with a moving target.

(GUN FIRES)

346
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:47,847
Well, a little slower
than I remember,

347
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:50,900
but that's probably on
account of the whiskey.

348
00:32:57,824 --> 00:32:58,958

(SCOFFS)

350
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:17,877
Dad was tryin'
to tell me somethin'
as he was dying.

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

352
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,877
I know you're losing
the ranch.

353
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,114
I overheard you and Alice.

354
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,378
Well...

00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:53,513
(SIGHS)

356
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,649
I think that's what Dad
was trying to tell me.

357
00:33:58,068 --> 00:33:59,469
Oh?

358
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,306
I wanna help.

359
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:08,645
Well, John, unless you got
$5,000 squirreled away,

360
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:10,613
I'm afraid we're movin'.

361
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:14,183
That's a lot of money, Rudd.

362
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:16,769
Ain't no way to come by
it honestly, I'm afraid.

363
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:21,991
I don't do that anymore.

364
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:26,478
Yeah, I know.

365
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:35,020
I am due a few hundred on
account of Dad's passing.

366
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:37,056
You are more than
welcome to that.

00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,126
I appreciate that.

368
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,465
You got any more apples?

369
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,206
Ah!

370
00:34:53,274 --> 00:34:54,307
That was me.

371
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,441
(CHUCKLES)

372
00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:56,942
That was me.
That was all me.

373
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,928
(LAUGHS)
That was all me.

374
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:02,681
Well, obviously
you're still drunk
because that was me.

375
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:04,884
You are still
so full of shit.

376
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,208
Let's go get
another bottle.

377
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,926
That's a whole
lot of money.

378
00:35:29,993 --> 00:35:31,961
I ain't after the money.

379
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:08,347
(HORSES NEIGHING)

380
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:12,384
Hello, friend!

381
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:30,802
Be careful.

382
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,538
There are explosives
back there.

383
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,724
I'll be comin' for that.

384
00:37:09,526 --> 00:37:10,643
(GROANS)

385
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:20,319
This could get real messy.

386
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:22,721
Move along now.

387
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,847
I said, move along!

388
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,181
Move out!

389
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:02,645
You okay?

390
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,883
Yeah.

391
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:13,656
I should start chargin'
for medical attention.

392
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,074
I'd pay for it.

393
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:20,379
Hey, where you off to?

394
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:24,583
A loose end
I gotta tie up.

395
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,616
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

396
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,922
COCHRANE: Are you from
around these parts?

397
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:50,225
Born not five minutes
from here.

398
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:57,600
I can't stand this
god-forsaken place.

399
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:03,021
I can't wait
till I get back east.

400
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:05,491
It's civilized back there.

401
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:10,262
Money, medicine,
a man can get a decent
bottle of Scotch.

402
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:13,999
I'm lookin' for someone.

403
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,820
Anyone in particular?

404
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,073
Of course,
someone in particular.

405
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,409
A fellow named
John Mason.

406
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:27,163
I got three dead in Missouri
on account of him.

407
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,132
A man's gotta answer
for his crimes.

408
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,569
I mean, even if the victims
were devoid of any semblance

409
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:39,141
of moral rectitude,
the law is the law.

410
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:45,615
Well, spoken like
a real concerned citizen.

411
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:49,352
I imagine
that kind of concern
comes with a nice reward.

412
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,240
Yeah, I know John Mason.

413
00:39:55,308 --> 00:39:57,759
He came through Promise
not two days back

414
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:00,629
lookin' for supplies
for a long trip.

415
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:03,031
Any idea which way
he was headed?

416
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,887
Sure could
use myself a drink.

417
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:16,395
He mentioned Nevada.

418
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:18,630
He said he had business
in Carson City.

419
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,116
Nevada.

420
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:28,424
Well, that there
ain't Scotch.

421
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,791
It's Bourbon.

422
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:33,312
From Kentucky!

423
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,681
Well, that's where Bourbon
comes from, doesn't it?

424
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:39,001
Well, you'd be surprised on
what passes for Bourbon
around these parts.

425
00:40:44,658 --> 00:40:46,342
Mind if I be
keepin' that?

426
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,711
Not at all.

427
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,113
Thank you.

428
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:52,598
Gentlemen.

429
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:09,999
(MEN LAUGHING)

430
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:24,830
The next time I tell you
to get movin',

431
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:26,098
you fuckin' move.

432
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:28,100
Easy, boss.

433
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:30,169
Yeah, easy, boss.

434
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,875
I'm gonna
take my share.

435
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:57,847
Good afternoon, Sheriff!

436
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,799
You're Dad Mason's son.

437
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:01,050
John.

438
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,220
The name is Hayden.

439
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:06,655
I ought to arrest you
where you stand.

440
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:12,077
You and Alice Gordon
used to steal
my daddy's crab apples.

441
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,180
I'll give you this,
you were fast as hell.

442
00:42:14,247 --> 00:42:16,482
You still run like that?
Only when I have to.

443
00:42:17,767 --> 00:42:19,468
Well, your father
was a good man.

444
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,787
Thank you, Sheriff.

445
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,372
Still lookin' to get
the men that did him.

446
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,776
The masked road agents
started up last year,

447
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,011
small time robbin'.

448
00:42:29,078 --> 00:42:31,980
They usually work over
the border in Montana.

449
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:34,350
Never killed no one
before Dad.

450
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:37,836
Well, I'd appreciate
you keepin' me informed.

451
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:40,690
Thanks again.

452
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,399
(GUN COCKING)

453
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:53,602
Take it off.

454
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:56,138
Please.

455
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:00,509
I was thinkin'
I'd meet McClure
at the station.

456
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,177
Oh, that's your trouble.

457
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,846
Too much thinkin'.

458
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,540
No, no,
he's all right, boys.

459
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:16,391
He's a friend.
Come on in.

460
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,895
Hey, what kept you?

461
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:21,480
Oh...

462
00:43:21,547 --> 00:43:22,848
Yeah, never mind.

463
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:24,766
Look at this.
We got the money.

464
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,602
Who else knows
about this?

465
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,870
Nobody.

466
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:31,840
What about
those two gorillas?

467
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:33,993
Oh, yeah, I trust them
like I trust you, John,

468
00:43:34,127 --> 00:43:35,310
with my life.

469
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,979
That's the rail workers'
pay, huh?

470
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,214
Yeah.

471
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:45,020
It's a lot of money.

472
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:46,421
Yep.

473
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,694
So, you comin'
to the Double Cross
for supper tonight?

474
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:53,528
I'll be there.
Atta boy.

475
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,399
So, what do you
think of Alice?

476
00:43:57,466 --> 00:43:58,667
She's pretty swell, huh?

477
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,354
Oh, yeah, no, she's...
She's real swell.

478
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:04,056
Yeah.
Yeah.

479
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:20,139
Alice Gordon?

480
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,757
(COCKING)

481
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:25,811
And from
the sound of that,

482
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:29,181
I would say that
that is a peacemaker.

483
00:44:29,248 --> 00:44:31,366
Well, if you know
this weapon then, uh,

484
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:33,752
I'm guessing you have
some understanding
of the mischief

485
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,722
it could cause
with a man's features.

486
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:44,730
May I come in?

487
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:52,872
He's supposed to have
killed a fellow in Tulsa
over a box of cigars.

488
00:44:53,506 --> 00:44:55,107
(CHUCKLES)

489
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,176
A box of cigars.

490
00:44:57,244 --> 00:44:59,144
Can you believe that?

491
00:44:59,146 --> 00:45:00,579
No, John ain't like that.

492
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:05,150
Look, Miss Gordon,
you have no idea what
Dodge City can do to a man.

493
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:08,370
John Mason was sheriff there
for a while,

494
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:09,805
a good one.

495
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,408
Until things went bad.

496
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:16,145
And then really bad

497
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,881
as things sometimes do
in Dodge City.

498
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:22,267
May I offer you a drink?

499
00:45:22,335 --> 00:45:24,052
What do you want with John?

500
00:45:25,538 --> 00:45:27,539
What do I want with John?

501
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:34,529
Did you ever hear
the story about him
winning his freedom

502
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:38,200
from this hellhole
of a prison in Mexico?

503
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,418
About cutting cards
with this rich kid?

504
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:46,591
This kid who was a piece
of uneducated, loathsome...

505
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:52,014
I can't use the word in
the presence of a lady.

506
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,667
I love being in the presence
of a smart, beautiful woman.

507
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:57,068
What genius!

508
00:45:57,136 --> 00:46:01,640
What a wonder that God
would take Adam's rib
and create Eve.

509
00:46:01,741 --> 00:46:03,392
Brilliant.

510
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:06,027
Just brilliant.

511
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:07,896
(CHUCKLES)

512
00:46:07,963 --> 00:46:11,466
Anyway, apparently
the prison was overcrowded

513
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:13,202
and they had just
brought in the Gaston Gang

514
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:15,204
and they needed room
to lock them up.

515
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:17,372
Have you not heard
of the Gaston Gang?

516
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,807
No, I have not.

517
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,678
Ah, nasty, very nasty.

518
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:25,063
Anyway, to make
a long story short,

519
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:29,418
the rich kid and John
were forced to cut cards

520
00:46:29,485 --> 00:46:32,387
to see
who would be set free

521
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:35,290
and who would rot in hell.

522
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:37,459
Then John pulled
the big spade.

523
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:39,494
(CHUCKLES)

524
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:42,864
Lucky, huh?

525
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:45,534
What are the odds
of him doing that?

526
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:47,769
One in fifty-two.

527
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:50,439
Yes.

528
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:52,608
Yes, one in fifty-two.

529
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:57,078
I had the opportunity
to speak to two
of the Gaston Gang

530
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,697
who had been there

531
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:02,317
and they said that John
didn't touch the cards,

532
00:47:02,368 --> 00:47:06,187
that the guards cut
the deck for them.

533
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,857
But the kid's family back
east doesn't believe that.

534
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:12,461
They think John cheated
and because the kid
died in prison,

535
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:14,612
they want their
pound of flesh

536
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:17,582
and that's why
they hired me,
to go find him.

537
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,436
And that's why
I want John Mason.

538
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:22,888
Because when
I bring him in,

539
00:47:22,956 --> 00:47:24,957
or bring in
what's left of him,

540
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:29,194
that'll settle
all my debts,

541
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:30,595
give me
a little money to...

542
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:31,997
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

543
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:34,283
The aroma of you
is exquisite.

544
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,101
You are
a magnificent woman.

545
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:38,770
You know, I think you
should get the fuck
out of my house.

(GUN COCKING)

547
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:44,376
You're not only
magnificent,

548
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:47,279
you are very,
very persuasive.

549
00:47:52,201 --> 00:47:53,952
COCHRANE: Hello, John.

550
00:47:58,191 --> 00:48:00,625
I missed ya
at the ranch.

551
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:02,544
It's a little nicer
than your other place,

552
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:05,547
but that shack
had its charms.

553
00:48:05,648 --> 00:48:07,132
To be honest with ya,
I miss it.

554
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,101
I'm sure you do.

555
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:13,371
You know, I had a nice,
little garden there.

556
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:14,923
That was a garden?

557
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:16,207
(COCHRANE LAUGHS)

558
00:48:23,582 --> 00:48:26,518
You have to be
gentle with a garden.

559
00:48:28,571 --> 00:48:31,022
Did I tell you
I nearly got hold of you up

560
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,492
in Medicine Hat
a year ago?

561
00:48:33,593 --> 00:48:36,645
That would have been
real nice to catch up.

562
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:40,416
Alice is a very
impressive woman.

563
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:41,633
Very.

564
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:45,954
John.

565
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,444
They made me a marshal.

566
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,231
How's it feel?

567
00:48:58,484 --> 00:49:00,752
It's interesting.

568
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,987
The reward
is dead or alive,

569
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:07,876
but I get a $500 bonus
if I bring you in alive.

570
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,912
You give me your word
that you won't run,

571
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,731
I'll give you
a little time.

572
00:49:16,636 --> 00:49:18,803
I appreciate it.

573
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:20,505
I hear tell there's
an establishment

574
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:22,540
up at Great Falls.

575
00:49:22,608 --> 00:49:24,442
Madam Kara's?

576
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,461
Madam Kara's.

577
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:28,964
Now would that still be
open for business?

578
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:31,149
Excellent.

579
00:49:31,884 --> 00:49:33,117
Excellent.

580
00:49:41,661 --> 00:49:43,795
Two days from now, huh?

581
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:46,898
A fork in the road
just outside the town
at dusk.

582
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:48,533
You come alone.

583
00:49:48,601 --> 00:49:50,452
I know I don't need
to mention this,

584
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,406
but if you did decide
not to appear,

585
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:58,143
I would kill everyone.

586
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:03,365
Absolutely everyone.

587
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,248

of a lot better than

590

Eh, I dunno.

591
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:33,128
I might have
some word on one of
the masked assholes

592
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,729
that done in Dad.

00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,492
Pretty good, huh?
It's great.

ALICE:
What's that, Rudd?

597
00:52:41,073 --> 00:52:44,226
Me and the Dixie Boys
were on our way to
pick up them new hogs.

598
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:45,694
Then we came upon them.

599
00:52:52,184 --> 00:52:53,568
They're all dead.

600
00:52:56,322 --> 00:52:57,705
You sure?

601
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,026
Undertaker has them
at the church.

602
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,298
Let's go take a look.

603
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:08,717
It doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

604
00:53:08,784 --> 00:53:10,585
They all had
masks on 'em.

605
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:12,621
And two of 'em swore
up and down they were
the ones who done it.

606
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:14,022
These are Cochrane's boys.

607
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,857
What are they doing
robbin' the Express?

608
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:17,191
The money?

609
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:18,727
I don't see Cochrane.

610
00:53:19,495 --> 00:53:21,062
No?
No.

611
00:53:22,698 --> 00:53:24,833
I killed 'em all
pretty near.

612
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,501
Pretty near
might not do it.

613
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:33,609

finest. Yes.

614
00:53:33,676 --> 00:53:35,110
ALICE: No.

615
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:37,061
Good job!

616
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:43,919
Did Mason tell you about
the plan that he had
to catch the outlaws?

617
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:47,121
Before you killed them,
I mean.

618
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:50,826
Mason wanted to use
the rail workers' money
as a lure,

619
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,327
flush 'em out.

620
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:58,066
Well, John and I
do know a little bit
about outlawin'.

621
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:01,502
That was a long time ago.

some outlawin'?

623
00:54:03,505 --> 00:54:05,273
Oh, we did some.

624
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,342
And then
we did some more.

625
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:10,712
Yeah, I think maybe
you should slow down.

626
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:12,981
I think I would like
to hear about this.

627
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:18,753

that was a long time ago.

628

long ago, John.

to ask my little sister
to marry him.

724
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,098
What do you think
about that?

725
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:18,072
I mean,
there's always room
on the bride's side

726
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,107
if you wanna
give her away.

727
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:29,117
She's been givin'
a little bit away,
my sister.

728
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,837
Hasn't she?

729
01:01:32,905 --> 01:01:34,772
What are you
talkin' about?

I come in peace.

735
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:36,334
Are you takin' over
for Dad?

736
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:38,385
Nah.

737
01:02:38,453 --> 01:02:40,421
I'm just straightening up
a few things.

738
01:02:40,488 --> 01:02:42,924
I'm leaving care of
the Express to McClure.

739
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:45,259
Oh.

740
01:02:46,612 --> 01:02:49,163
John, I'm...
Hey, I know.

741
01:02:50,782 --> 01:02:54,269
You really gonna
turn yourself in to
that bounty hunter?

742
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:56,087
I gave the man my word.

743
01:02:58,223 --> 01:03:00,324
Well, things have
a way of workin' out.

744
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:06,731
Hey, I don't think
I've ever seen that
safe closed before.

745
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:10,868
The railway workers'
money came in.

746
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:13,688
Oh.

747
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:17,191
When's it headin' out?

748
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:20,595
But I guess you wanna
keep them details a secret.

749
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,098
No, I put the word out.

750
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,034
It leaves tomorrow morning.

751
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,353
You put the word out?

752
01:03:31,873 --> 01:03:35,559
I'm trying to attract
a certain element.

753
01:03:36,929 --> 01:03:38,646
They're all dead.

754
01:03:39,698 --> 01:03:40,831
Maybe.

755
01:03:43,185 --> 01:03:45,770
So you escortin'
that money yourself?

756
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:47,020
Yeah.

about them horses?

Nah, there's no reason
for both of us to get
the lash.

762

workers' money.

768
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,566
That's right.

769
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:34,235
You know, somebody
might actually

770
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,571
take it upon himself
to rob that Express.

771
01:04:38,857 --> 01:04:40,691
I'm countin' on it.

772

be really pissed

if you go and get
yourself killed.

I'll keep that in mind.

I just have this feeling
that something terrible
is gonna happen.

We can't.

you sure as shit ain't
a peace officer now.

off him!

Yeah, well, if two
of those questions are,

"Where's the money?"
And "Who killed Dad Mason?"

847
01:13:44,936 --> 01:13:47,054
I might be able
to help him out.

get me that money.

for that name.

it's fitting though.

so you know that
I'm telling you the truth.

857
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:21,071
I will sacrifice her
to save the ranch

so hard to build.

859
01:14:25,276 --> 01:14:27,043
Now get me my money.

860
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:33,734
I'm gonna give you an hour
to get out of town.

How is it that you're
the one threatening me,

862

yet you're the one
behind bars?

863
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,612

hear me.

are you doin'?

going on between

I don't know if it's
anything serious,
but, um,

872
01:15:31,826 --> 01:15:33,127
it's goin' on.

873
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:40,334
Okay.

874
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:55,666
Those bullets meant
for John?

875
01:15:57,718 --> 01:15:59,686
They're in case
we need to talk.

876
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,257
Talk.

100 % of the time.

883
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:32,519
Shut the fuck up!

884
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:35,004
You're the one going
to hang for killing
them Pinkertons.

885
01:16:35,072 --> 01:16:36,256
What?

886
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,459
I said Pinkertons.

887
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:41,461
What?

888
01:16:43,764 --> 01:16:45,933
Pinkertons.

889
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,968
I'm sorry, I can't
understand a word
you are saying.

you know that?

any trouble, are you?

I could do something
for you.

to shoot you again
