00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,724
A big fellow, about 6' 4"
riding that Appaloosa stud out there,

29
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:45,757
he came in here a little while ago?

30
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:49,445
He in the washroom.
He shaves, he cleans up.

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,466
Thanks.

32
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:08,752
Hi, Cole.

33
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:12,207
That's a voice I'd know anywhere.

34
00:03:12,303 --> 00:03:17,048
JP Harrah. Wait till I get
some of the soap out of my eyes.

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,223
I heard you were made sheriff...

36
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,860
What's the idea of the gun?

37
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,173
Just ' till I find out
which side you're on, Cole.

38
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:30,519
What do you mean?
I heard you were working for Bart Jason.

39
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,740
Well, Nothing's set yet.

40
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:38,904
He offered me good money, but I haven't
found out what I have to do to earn it.

41
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:42,577
Would you like to hear?
Yeah, go ahead.

42
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:45,749
Cole, that's about close
enough to that gun.

43
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:49,749
I just wanted to see
if you'd slowed down any.

44
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,829
Not that much.

45
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,832
What were you saying about Jason?

46
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:58,971
Well, he showed up here around the end
of the war with a pocket full of money.

47
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,427
Nobody seems to be able to
find out where he got it from...

48
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,954
but... everybody else
around here was broke.

49
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,085
You know how it was then.
Yeah, all over Texas.

50
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,941
Well, having money, he
started to grow.

51
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:11,439
Now, he can't grow any bigger
until he gets more water.

52
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,773
There's only one place to get it.

53
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:17,728
Trouble is, somebody was there
ahead of him. About 20 years ahead.

54
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,863
A man named Kevin MacDonald got here

55
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,073
when there was nothing
but Indians and coyotes.

56
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,909
Mr. MacDonald's got four boys and a
girl, and they've all worked real hard.

57
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,912
They hung together through
all the rough times,

58
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:29,776
and now that things are
beginning to look up,

59
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,539
MacDonald's in no mind to sell.

60
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:36,923
So he's holding and Jason's pushing...
and I'm standing right in the middle.

61
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:39,760
It's not the way it was told to me.

62
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:43,972
That's the way it is, Cole, I guess
you're supposed to take care of me.

63
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:50,392
Well, not that I couldn't... do it, Harrah,
but... I don't think I'd like that.

64
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,893
I'm glad to hear you say that.

65
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:56,231
Not that I couldn't handle you...
but... I don't think I'd like that either.

66
00:04:56,443 --> 00:05:01,520
Suppose I tell Jason that
I had a long talk with you and...

67
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:04,106
and you scared me off.

68
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,526
Good enough?
Good enough.

69
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,828
You can put that thing down now.

70
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:12,832
There's somethin' familiar
about that gun.

71
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:15,832
I just had it fixed-up
the way you had yours.

72
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,855
You got lucky with it,
I thought I'd try it.

73
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:19,355
Ha!

74
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,423
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

75
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:24,026
Cole Thornton, you decent? You'd
better be, 'cause I'm a comin' in.

76
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,617
Ah, it's good to see you.

77
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:29,044
You know when they told me you
were here, I didn't believe them!

78
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,385
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me, I thought that...

79
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:35,012
Hi, JP (LAUGHING)

80
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:41,902
What's so funny?
This whole thing. (CONTINUING TO LAUGH)

81
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,855
Do you know what
she's laughing about?

82
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,237
I gather you knew him
before you knew me.

83
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:50,652
Before you? I knew her
when she was a kid.

84
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,305
Didn't you know that, JP?

85
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:57,578
No, you never mentioned that.
Up until now, I thought you had good taste.

86
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,416
And, up until now,
I thought she had good taste.

87
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:03,912
(SIGH)...I'm awful glad
you two are friends.

88
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:06,379
We may not be when we
think this thing over.

89
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,092
If you aren't, I'm
through with both of you.

90
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:10,792
You know something, Cole, I think
We better get ourselves a new girl.

91
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:13,552
Yeah.
You better not. -Why not?

92
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,428
I'm girl enough for you both.
Say, can I buy you a drink?

93
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,738
Well, I'd like that very much,

94
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:22,836
but I promised JP I'd do
something for him, didn't I?

95
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:26,068
Yes, you did.
Of Course, if you want to do my errand...

96
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,525
No, you do your own work, Cole.

97
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,769
Will you buy us that drink
a couple of hours from now?

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,868
Yeah, sure will.

99
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,115
Where is this Bart Jason's place?

100
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,576
You take the main road
north out of town.

101
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:40,535
And after you cross the creek,
and you come to a big rock.

102
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,379
Big rock.

103
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,906
That's right. That's
MacDonald's boundary.

104
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:45,789
MacDonald's?
Yeah.

105
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,672
You ride east from there about 3 miles
and you get to Bart Jason's ranch.

106
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,796
Maudie, remember, I'm coming back.

107
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,717
Oh, I left some things...
I'll take care of it.

108
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,801
Thanks.

109
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:07,480
You mad at me, JP?
You know better than that, Maudie.

110
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:09,607
Ha... you must like that man.

111
00:07:09,736 --> 00:07:13,022
Want me to tell you about him?
You don't have to tell me about Cole.

112
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:17,112
I know I don't.
That's why I want to.

113
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:21,531
I met Cole right after my husband
was killed. I did tell you that.

114
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:25,572
Yeah, you told me.
Well, there I was, stranded...

115
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:29,796
A gambler's widow,
not a chip to my name.

116
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:35,166
Cole was awful good to me. Gave me
a stake, helped me get on my feet.

117
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,261
Never would take a...

118
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:42,968
(SIGHS) I don't know, JP.
With Cole and me, I guess it's a...

119
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:46,428
I'll always think of him as a...
He's a top hand.

120
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:52,475
I guess so.
Yeah, well, Cole always was pretty lucky.

121
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,046
Have you known
him a long time?

122
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:56,845
Yeah, I've known him a long
time, since before the war.

123
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,280
We've... ah... traveled some together.
Sure, I know what that means.

124
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,245
It means either you saved his life,
or he saved yours, or both.

125
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,583
And neither of you
will talk about it... Men!

126
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,501
Would you like it set to music,
Maudie, with a full orchestra?

127
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,587
Well, I'll see you, Maudie.
Hey, don't forget to come back!

128
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,335
Well, I'm certainly not going
to leave you alone with him.

129
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:22,491
You're not a friend.

130
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:30,763
Hell!

131
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:36,062
(HORSES NEIGHING,
MEN CALLING WHOA!)

132
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,953
MacDonald! Kevin MacDonald!

133
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,751
Howdy, Roy. Something wrong?

134
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:03,375
Doc Miller sent me out, said to tell you
Bart Jason hired himself a gunhand:

135
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:06,803
Cole Thornton. And Thorton rode
out there about an hour ago.

136
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:09,558
Doc wanted you to know. He said
to tell you to be careful.

137
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:13,141
Thanks, Roy. Tell Doc I'm
much obliged to both of you.

138
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:19,812
Matt, you and Saul stay with me, we'll
take these horses back to the ranch.

139
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:21,987
Joey, get out to the
West Fork and tell Jared

140
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:24,012
to get back to the ranch
as soon as he can.

141
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:25,899
OK, Pa.

142
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,198
Luke.
Yes, Pa.

143
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,571
Get up there on that rock. If
you see anybody coming, fire

144
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,730
a shot into the air, that'll
give us a little warning.

145
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,169
All right, Pa.
Wait a minute, I ain't finished yet...

146
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:43,795
As soon as you fire that shot, you jump
on your horse and hightail it, you hear!

147
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,922
I hear you, Pa.

148
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:52,173
All right, let's go!

149
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:56,820
(SOUND OF GUN SHOTS, HORSES NEIGHING
AND CALLS OF 'LET'S GO!' AND 'HIYAH!')

150
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:34,346
Where can I find Mister Jason?
He's up at the main house.

151
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,147
¡Gracias!

152
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:50,275
Mr. Jason, you got a visitor.

153
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:58,108
Cole Thornton?
That's right.

154
00:10:58,203 --> 00:10:59,911
I'm Bart Jason.

155
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,745
I've been expecting you. Get off your
horse, and make yourself comfortable.

156
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:07,544
I won't be here
long enough for that.

157
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:10,547
Here's what's left
of your expense money.

158
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:15,128
Sorry about the rest of it,
but that's the chance you take.

159
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:17,509
I've decided against working for you.

160
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:20,965
Before you even talked about it?

161
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:25,803
No, you wouldn't do that.
You must've talked to somebody.

162
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:28,731
I did. The sheriff.

163
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,437
His story is a little different
from yours

164

it sure is good to see you.

332
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,493
What sheriff had to hire you
for a deputy?

333
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,948
You're looking
at him. Hi ya, Cole!

334
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,494
Dodd Draper!
The last time I saw you two,

335
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,496
you were ten jumps ahead of a
posse raisin' dust for Mexico.

336
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,146
Hey, heard you got shot.

337
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:32,361
Yeah, but that was six
or seven months ago.

338
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:35,377
How about supper?
And I'll buy you a beer, too.

339
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,710
We'd like to, but we're working men.

340
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:41,594
How about that cantina up the street?
Good place to eat?

341
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,932
Good as any. You sticking around?
Day or two.

342
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,889
Well, we'll see you later, Cole.

343
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,858
Señor...

344
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,147
your dinner will be ready
in one minute.

345
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:55,148
Gee Sevas, Gracias...

346
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,087
Buena Noches Señoras

347
00:27:14,288 --> 00:27:17,338
Bring something to eat, comidas...
Plenty of it Si Señor.

348
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:19,880
Right away.
Something to drink, also, vamanos.

349
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:24,764
Señor?

350
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:26,722
A Five and a one.

351
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,955
Charlie Hagan.
Yeah.

352
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,330
You want something from me?

353
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:43,372
You don't remember me, do you?
No.

354
00:28:47,176 --> 00:28:48,496
Do you remember this hat?

355
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,904
Well, why in the hell would I
remember a hat? (LAUGHTER)

356
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:58,096
You killed the man
that was wearing it

357
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:00,347
Ladies.

358
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:01,564
Si, Señor, si

359
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:04,981
Who was this fellow I killed?
A friend of yours?

360
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,978
You could say that.

361
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,610
When did I do this, boy?
Two years ago, come September.

362
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,073
You and three others.

363
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:18,660
Natchez-Under-the-Hill,
on the Mississippi.

364
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:25,917
He was a gambler, named Johnny Diamond...
and he was kind of an old man.

365
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:32,009
Shouldn't have taken four of you.
Do you remember, Charlie?

366
00:29:32,094 --> 00:29:35,593
I remember. He was a cardsharp.
He was cheating.

367
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:39,429
No... no, he was good.
He didn't have to cheat.

368
00:29:39,518 --> 00:29:44,096
It shouldn't have taken 4 of you, Joey.
No, it shouldn't of.

369
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:49,892
Well, I'm sure glad you remember, Mr.
Hagan. The other three did.

370
00:29:50,403 --> 00:29:54,697
The other three?
Yeah, I caught up with them.

371
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:57,780
You're the last.

372
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:02,452
And now I think you better stand up.

373
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,786
Stand up, Charlie.
I'm curious to see how he does this.

374
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,042
He doesn't have a gun.

375
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:13,079
And like he said, it shouldn't
have taken four of you.

376
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:20,089
Stand up, Charlie.

377
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,533
You with the hat.

378
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:55,298
You killed Charlie 'cause he
killed your friend, right?

379
00:30:56,257 --> 00:30:57,091
That's right.

380
00:30:57,122 --> 00:30:59,622
Well, it happens, Charlie
was a good friend of mine.

381
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,942
So let's see you
do that trick twice.

382
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:03,973
(GUNSHOT WITH RICOCHET
AND GUN DROPPING)

383
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,308
I'd let it drop, friend.

384
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:11,678
Me?
You.

385
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,104
(GUN DROPS TO FLOOR)

386
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:15,291
Hope you don't mind.

387
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:17,304
Always seems to take
more than one doesn't it?

388
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:19,609
That's because they're no good.

389
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:22,407
Pick up your gun.
What?

390
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:27,076
You want to try again, now?
Pick up your gun.

391
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,582
Against him, or you?

392
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,828
Me first.
Why should you go first?

393
00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:39,961
Pick it up.
Now, just a second...

394
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:42,088
Tell me about it later!
I'll tell you now! -Shut up!

395
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:44,963
Go on. You were plenty willing
when you had a kid...

396
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:48,837
Hold it! Don't get mad, mister.

397
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:52,764
Before you start anything, I can't
afford to lose another man.

398
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,166
You promise to
take Milt's place?

399
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:57,713
You got a lot of faith
in me, don't you, Nelse?

400
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:03,655
Faith can move mountains, Milt,
but it can't beat a faster draw.

401
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,901
There's only three men I
know with his kind of speed.

402
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:13,372
One's dead, the other's me,
and the third is Cole Thornton.

403
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,578
There's a fourth.

404
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:19,284
Which one are you?
I'm Thornton.

405
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:24,504
Aren't you glad you
didn't try, Milt?

406
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:28,880
Pick up your guns, both of you.
Real easy.

407
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,054
Like he said, real easy.

408
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,840
And take him out of here.

409
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:48,312
Thornton, I'd like to talk to you.
I'm Nelse McLeod.

410
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:51,988
I thought so. Pretty far
off your range, aren't you?

411
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,068
A little. Can I buy you a drink?

412
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:56,367
Why not?
You, too.

413
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,412
Glasses.

414
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:00,906
You working now, Thornton?
No.

415
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:04,750
Is it all right if music play now Señor?
Yeah, sure.

416
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,451
Muchachos, musica...

417
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,133
You say you're not working. What would
you say if I tried to hire you on?

418
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,044
First I'd ask about the money.
Money's good.

419
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:17,262
Then I'd ask about the job.

420
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,840
Well, good evening.
Thanks for the drink, gentlemen.

421
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:23,933
Just a minute, son.
I am not your son.

422
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:27,771
My name is Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

423
00:33:27,943 --> 00:33:30,232
Lord Almighty.
Yeah.

424
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,692
That's why most people call me
Mississippi.

425
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:35,616
Mississippi?
I was born on the river in a flat boat.

426
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,867
You're pretty good with that knife.
Can you use a gun?

427
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:43,456
If I could, I'd be using one.
Good evening.

428
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,913
Just a minute, Mississippi.

429
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:50,035
Would you mind telling me why you have
such a great passion for my company?

430
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:53,250
Will you just relax
for a couple of minutes?

431
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:55,418
You were telling me
about the job.

432
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,381
There's a little range war
up in the El Dorado country.

433
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,965
El Dorado? Mind telling
me who hired you?

434
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,890
Fellow named Bart Jason.
Do you know him?

435
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:10,973
We met. He offered me the job a few
months back. I didn't take it.

436
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:14,101
Do you know who
you're up against?

437
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:17,030
Yeah. The sheriff, JP Harrah.

438
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:19,652
I understand he used to be
pretty good with a gun.

439
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:22,992
Not just pretty good, McLeod.
He's the...

440
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,779
The fourth man you told me about.
That's right.

441
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:29,495
Well, he used to be.
He's not any more.

442
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:32,960
Well, what happened?
What usually happens to a man?

443
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,873
A woman.

444
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:39,176
Seems like he tangled with some wandering
petticoat... he's been drunk ever since.

445
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:44,637
You figure to move in before he sobers
up, or... before they get a new sheriff?

446
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,684
And you're not coming in?
No.

447
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,474
I suppose you have your reasons.

448
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,774
It's probably just as well.

449
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:57,267
With two like us in
the same bunch...

450
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,397
sooner or later we'd have to find
out which one of us was faster.

451
00:35:02,741 --> 00:35:05,411
Yeah, I guess you're right.

452
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,035
So long, Thornton.

453
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,741
I thought we were going.

454
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:17,000
Mississippi, just listen.

455
00:35:18,131 --> 00:35:23,089
McLeod, would you like to walk out
that door first, ahead of us?

456
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,386
Nope. I don't believe I would.

457
00:35:26,597 --> 00:35:29,717
I didn't think so.

458
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:32,807
Pedro, Milt, can you hear me?

459
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,720
We hear you.
I'm coming out.

460
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,503
Where are you?

461
00:35:40,523 --> 00:35:44,942
Jeffe... over here.
Come on out.

462
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:51,532
Further into the light, hurry.

463
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:55,615
Now drop your guns.

464
00:36:01,756 --> 00:36:03,795
Come here.

465
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,009
Inside.

466
00:36:12,057 --> 00:36:15,426
That all right, Thornton?
Good enough.

467
00:36:15,602 --> 00:36:18,473
Mississippi, get their guns.

468
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:22,691
If it's all right with you, McLeod,
we'll drop 'em at the sheriff's office

469
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:25,979
and your boys can pick 'em
up on their way out of town.

470
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:29,986
Sounds reasonable.
Much obliged.

471
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,773
Call it professional courtesy.

472
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:44,667
Want to get something
to eat, Mississippi?

473
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:48,496
Mr. Thornton, I would've walked
out of here and right into

474
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,455
those two fellas if you
hadn't stopped me.

475
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,546
I asked if you were hungry.
I'm trying to thank you.

476
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:57,422
I'm hungry! That shivaree you put
on in there interrupted my supper.

477
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:59,556
It wore out our welcome.

478
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:01,886
Now, we'll have to find
someplace else to eat.

479
00:37:02,063 --> 00:37:05,396
Now?
Now.

480
00:37:18,021 --> 00:37:20,121
¿Que quieres mas?

481
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:22,363
She wants to know
if you want something else.

482
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:25,122
Just coffee.

483
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:26,123
Café, por favor.

484
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,545
Not very hungry huh?
No, not so much.

485
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:38,548
A little green around the gills.
Yep.

486
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:41,468
I just finished something tonight
I've been two years doing.

487
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:45,805
What are you figuring on doing next?
Going back to the river?

488
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:50,019
I haven't thought much about
what I'm going to do next.

489
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,231
The river won't be
the same without old...

490
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:56,530
Well, if you're going to stay around here,
I've got two pieces of advice for you...

491
00:37:56,615 --> 00:38:00,992
Get rid of that hat.
Learn how to use a gun.

492
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:03,542
I don't figure on
gettin' rid of that hat.

493
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:04,650
No?

494
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,829
No.

495
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,504
Johnny Diamond, he's the friend I...
ah... the man that raised me.

496
00:38:14,298 --> 00:38:20,217
All he left behind was
a gold watch and this hat.

497
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:25,298
I had to sell that gold watch
a year or so back.

498
00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:29,343
So, I guess
I'll just hang on to that hat.

499
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:32,729
What about learning to use a gun?

500
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,728
Johnny didn't believe in guns.
He always thought that...

501
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:38,523
He's dead. Think about that.

502
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:43,025
Unless you can learn to
stay out of trouble.

503
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:47,411
That's one thing even old Johnny
couldn't teach me to do.

504
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:51,825
Well, I'll be moving along.
Good luck to you.

505
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:55,746
Ah... you don't suppose
I could ride along with ya?

506
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:58,590
Nope.
That's plain enough.

507
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:01,210
Well, I hope everything
works out all right.

508
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,561
What works out?

509
00:39:03,178 --> 00:39:05,420
Whatever it is you're going to do.

510
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:09,883
Pay for the meal, will you?
So long.

511
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:17,679
♪

512
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,253
Hold it, Cochise.

513
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,516
Steady boy. lt'll take a minute.

514
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:13,027
Cole! Cole Thornton!

515
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,367
Where are you?

516
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,323
Close enough to blow your hat off
if I hadn't 'a recognised it.

517
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:33,554
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.

518
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,339
Don't you know better than
to follow a man that way?

519
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,388
Sorry, I don't know there's another way.
You almost got shot.

520
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,438
You fall off your horse?
Yeah.

521
00:40:43,523 --> 00:40:45,231
You hurt?
No.

522
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,356
Well, there's something
the matter with you.

523
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,173
Well look, I've got a
bullet in my back,

524
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:51,624
sometimes it presses
against something and...

525
00:40:52,198 --> 00:40:54,541
I get a screaming pain,
then there's nothing...

526
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:57,218
it goes numb, and I
can't use this hand.

527
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:58,671
How long does that last?

528
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:01,528
Just for a while. Why
are you following me?

529
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:05,490
Well, I got to thinkin' about
what you're going to do.

530
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:08,334
And just what am I gonna do?

531
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:11,429
You're going to that
town, El Dorado, to help

532
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,205
your friend against
McLeod and his bunch.

533
00:41:14,302 --> 00:41:16,972
How do you know
he's my friend?

534
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,094
That look on your face when you
heard he'd turned into a drunk.

535
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:24,508
Well, this thing's wearing off.

536
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:27,095
Give me a hand
up on my horse.

537
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,773
You sure your friend's
worth helping?

538
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:39,029
You just spent two years chasing some
fellas that killed a friend of yours.

539
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:42,368
You think your friend
was worth two years?

540
00:41:42,454 --> 00:41:46,582
I guess I asked a fool question.
You did.

541
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:07,016
Give him a breather.
Slow him down.

542
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:11,764
I was wondering.
Just how good is this McLeod?

543
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:17,522
I don't know first hand, but
they say he's one of the best.

544
00:42:17,696 --> 00:42:20,527
I figure he'd be pretty mad you...
you turning

545
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:23,147
him down and showing-up
on the other side.

546
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:26,285
I hope he is.
How come?

547
00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:29,704
Fellow in his business
hasn't got a right to get mad.

548
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:32,495
He gets mad,
he's not so good.

549
00:42:32,585 --> 00:42:35,752
So the madder he gets,
the better I like it.

550
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:38,590
Ha! Sure wish I was
there to see that.

551
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:41,509
Why do you want to keep
sticking your nose in this?

552
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:44,927
Maybe I could help.
You saved my life two times.

553
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:48,513
But I'm going to be too busy
to keep doing that.

554
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,102
You can't even use a gun.

555
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:53,375
You could teach me. I
need somebody to teach me.

556
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:55,929
Johnny Diamond always
told me to get the best.

557
00:42:56,024 --> 00:43:00,152
Well, he was right there.
But you're not going to El Dorado.

558
00:43:00,236 --> 00:43:04,103
Oh, I'm not, huh?
No, you're not.

559
00:43:07,076 --> 00:43:10,990
"Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,"

560
00:43:11,205 --> 00:43:15,333
"In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long..."

561
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:17,956
What's that all about?
Just a poem.

562
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:20,084
One of Johnny Diamond's favorites.

563
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:23,126
Let's see: "Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight",

564
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,175
"In sunshine and in shadow, Had
journeyed long, singing a song,"

565
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:31,175
"In search of El Dorado."

566
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:36,342
"Over the mountains of the moon,
Down the valley of the shadow,"

567
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:39,272
"Ride, boldly ride..."

568
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:44,315
Always liked that poem, too.
Makes me want to ah...

569
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:49,148
Ride, boldly ride?
Well, it don't work out that way.

570
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:51,399
I'm learning that.

571
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:01,329
Oh, Hell! Hold it, Cochise.

572
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,289
Step down off that horse.
You always giving people orders?

573
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:16,766
You wanted to learn to shoot.

574
00:44:25,234 --> 00:44:27,273
Right out there.

575
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:34,825
Hold it, Mississippi.
That's no way to use a handgun.

576
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,968
You gotta to draw and
fire, and you gotta be

577
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:39,209
quicker than somebody else
doing the same thing.

578
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,279
Like this.

579
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,333
I see.

580
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:55,385
How's that?
Were you aiming at that cholla?

581
00:44:56,805 --> 00:45:01,716
No, the place you were shooting at.
'Fraid it's useless.

582
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:08,271
Well, we'll be passing through Cuervo.
I'll have a talk with the Swede.

583
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:10,516
Who's the Swede?

584
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,861
An old friend of mine... a gunsmith.
Aah!

585
00:45:19,994 --> 00:45:22,033
There's the place.

586
00:45:33,307 --> 00:45:35,007
Why, Cole Thornton!

587
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:39,337
Swede, good to see you.
And what brings you around here?

588
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:44,387
Well, I'm looking for a gun for a fella
that can't shoot... Mississippi.

589
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:46,385
Swede Larson.

590
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,456
Can you help us?

591
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,422
Yaha, I think, I've got just
the gun you're looking for.

592
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,438
Well good!

593
00:45:54,373 --> 00:45:55,483
Wow!

594
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,105
How wide will that shot spread?
Well, now... I mean, how big a pattern?

595
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:04,072
I don't know. The fellow who used it
before, he couldn't see too good.

596
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,866
He just shoot where he hear
somebody talk.

597
00:46:06,955 --> 00:46:10,406
What happened to him?
He has a fight in a saloon.

598
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,620
The piano player
he make so much noise,

599
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:17,330
he couldn't hear the other man, so
he just shoot the piano player,

600
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:19,463
and they hung him.

601
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:22,717
Looks pretty good to me.
Shoots good, too.

602
00:46:22,804 --> 00:46:24,962
How about ammunition?

603
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:28,756
Four or five boxes ought to be enough.
Good.

604
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:31,834
Well, Mississippi, looks
like what you need.

605
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:32,925
It sure is!

606
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,274
Pay the man... Swede.
Cole, you come back soon.

607
00:46:41,947 --> 00:46:45,363
A likely spot to
try that new gun.

608
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:56,873
Try that cactus.

609
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,020
(SHOTGUN BLAST)

610
00:47:09,556 --> 00:47:12,012
You can't miss with that.

611
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:14,849
It's all right.

612
00:47:21,985 --> 00:47:26,611
How far is it from here to El Dorado?
We'll be in there around midnight.

613
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:33,379
♪

614
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:38,413
Well, where are we headed?

615
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,991
To see a girl.
To see a girl?

616
00:47:41,086 --> 00:47:43,245
Yes, a girl.

617
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:45,794
Don't you think I
could know a girl?

618
00:47:45,882 --> 00:47:49,880
I always make you mad, don't I?
Mostly.

619
00:47:52,472 --> 00:47:55,805
Hold it... this, yeah!
This is it.

620
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:25,111
Cole. Cole!!

621
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:28,499
Maudie, keep it quiet.
I got to talk to you.

622
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,499
I'll let you in.

623
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:42,308
Keep your eyes open.

624
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:44,764
Oh, You sure pick the
darnedest times to...

625
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:48,314
Who's your friend?
My name's Alan Bourdillion Traherne.

626
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,018
Just call him Mississippi for now.
Hi, Mississippi.

627
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:54,151
You stay out here and watch.
Couldn't I...?

628
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,196
No.

629
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:04,362
Cole, I'm so glad to see you.
I've got so many things to tell you.

630
00:49:04,457 --> 00:49:06,975
Maudie, there's a lot
I've got to say to you but,

631
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:09,730
first I've got to
have some answers.

632
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:14,457
Are there any strangers in town?
No, no, I'd have known if there were.

633
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,673
This one you'd have noticed:

634
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,176
A dark, thin faced man,
with a scar here and a marled eye.

635
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:23,051
Nelse McLeod.
Nelse? I've heard of him.

636
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:26,142
Should've had four or five
riders with him.

637
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:28,386
He's not here yet.
Well, good...

638
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,805
at least we beat them in.

639
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:33,105
Now, about JP.

640
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:38,982
Want the whole story?
Just don't make it too long.

641
00:49:39,073 --> 00:49:42,276
After you left,
I didn't see much of him.

642
00:49:42,368 --> 00:49:47,030
Oh, he'd drop in for a drink once
in a while. I guess he was lonely.

643
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:51,202
One day a girl came into town,
just stepped off the stage and...

644
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:53,286
Well, you know how kind...

645
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:58,420
Yeah, she probably had big sad eyes and
a long sad story. That's his type.

646
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:02,921
Yeah. She was no good. I tried
to tell him, so did others.

647
00:50:03,013 --> 00:50:06,547
Bull told him
and he knocked Bull down.

648
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:11,350
So JP had found out the hard way.
She ran off with a drummer.

649
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:14,521
He's... he's not been sober since.
It's been about two months.

650
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:17,774
Well, that he's going
to have to get over in a hurry.

651
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,396
Is he over at the jail?

652
00:50:19,427 --> 00:50:22,766
He's still sheriff,
though I don't know why.

653
00:50:22,907 --> 00:50:27,817
We'll mosey on... Oh, have you got
a room for Mississippi and me?

654
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:31,092
Oh... sure! Hey, have you
eaten anything lately?

655
00:50:31,123 --> 00:50:32,300
No.

656
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,861
I'll have something ready
for you when you get back.

657
00:50:35,919 --> 00:50:37,746
I'm glad you're here.

658
00:50:38,505 --> 00:50:42,585
Don't tell anybody you saw us.
I won't.

659
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,765
Well, I found one thing out.
What's that?

660
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:53,091
You know a girl.
Ha!

661
00:51:03,695 --> 00:51:05,522
Hold it!

662
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:07,986
It's as far as you
can come now.

663
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,409

01:29:48,611 --> 01:29:52,774
Joey, you better
round up your family,

1154
01:29:52,865 --> 01:29:56,031
and tell them to go home and stay
there until this thing's over.

What's wrong, Joey?

Lots of things.
My husband, Saul, Jason's men took him.

1485

Yes, they've got him.

They sent the boy back with a message:

1489
01:50:52,769 --> 01:50:56,981
Said we can have Saul back alive if Pa was
to turn his water rights over to Jason.

1490
01:50:57,065 --> 01:50:59,223
And he's going to do it?
He ain't got any choice!

give Saul back, don't you, sheriff?

That's always the way, isn't it?

1635
02:01:47,992 --> 02:01:51,850
Hey Bull, what's going on out there?
Town's fit to bust out.

1636
02:01:51,937 --> 02:01:55,804
Be a big time tonight.
Every son feels like hollerin'.

1637
02:01:55,899 --> 02:01:58,520
How's your leg, Cole?
Ask the Doc.

1638
02:01:58,610 --> 02:02:02,821
Oh, it's not too bad! You know these
wounds were made by buckshot, don't you?

1639
02:02:02,852 --> 02:02:04,512
I thought they were.
(Coffee Spilling to Floor)

1640
02:02:04,542 --> 02:02:05,473
Who was using a shotgun?

1641
02:02:05,658 --> 02:02:07,780
Oh, there was a certain
young man with a...

1642
02:02:07,811 --> 02:02:09,353
I was using a shotgun, Doc.

1643
02:02:09,537 --> 02:02:12,573
You? I thought you were on their side.
He was.

1644
02:02:12,665 --> 02:02:14,871
I told you I was
no good with a gun.

1645
02:02:15,084 --> 02:02:17,539
Trouble is, Doc,
Cole was in front of the gun.

1646
02:02:17,628 --> 02:02:21,210
The safe place is behind Mississippi
when he shoots that thing.

1647
02:02:21,298 --> 02:02:25,378
You, too, Bull, huh?
I think I'll take a little walk.

1648
02:02:25,469 --> 02:02:27,591
See that gal?
What gal?

1649
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:30,217
The one that thinks you look
better without that hat.

1650
02:02:30,306 --> 02:02:32,395
Why don't you tell her
why you're wearin' it?

1651
02:02:32,426 --> 02:02:34,286
Don't have to, I've
already told her

1652
02:02:34,435 --> 02:02:38,563
She's madder 'n a wet hen. Said you
let her make a fool of herself.

1653
02:02:38,648 --> 02:02:43,226
Ah, a host of friends...
I have a host of friends!

1654
02:02:43,319 --> 02:02:45,810
And, I'm sorry about that leg...
Forget it.

1655
02:02:46,113 --> 02:02:49,363
Yeah. I'll see you.

1656
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,825
Mr. Thornton, that'll be a little sore
for a few days, but it'll be all right.

1657
02:02:53,856 --> 02:02:54,734
Yeah...

1658
02:02:54,765 --> 02:02:56,481
I Hope you have time
to let me fix your back.

1659
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:59,196
Well, just as soon as
this leg heals, Doc.

1660
02:02:59,227 --> 02:03:00,553
I'll be ready.

1661
02:03:02,671 --> 02:03:07,747
Hey, Cole, where's Maudie?
I was wondering about that too.

1662
02:03:07,926 --> 02:03:11,590
I left her down the street just
before this ruckus started.

1663
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:13,921
Ah, she'll probably
be around pretty soon.

1664
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:16,465
Well, I wouldn't count
on that too much.

1665
02:03:16,642 --> 02:03:19,643
I just talked to her down at her place.
Well?

1666
02:03:19,728 --> 02:03:23,560
If'n you was running for president,
I figure, you wouldn't get her vote.

1667
02:03:23,649 --> 02:03:25,688
Well, what did I do?

1668
02:03:25,776 --> 02:03:29,476
Well, she said she was plum
through waitin' on a man...

1669
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:31,816
whilst he's runnin'
around being a target for

1670
02:03:31,847 --> 02:03:33,895
anybody that had a
notion to shoot a gun.

1671
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:36,488
Said she couldn't take it no more.
She said that?

1672
02:03:36,578 --> 02:03:40,196
Yeah, she said that, and she
added a few frills and dressing.

1673
02:03:40,331 --> 02:03:43,746
The main idea was,
the door was closed.

1674
02:03:43,751 --> 02:03:46,609
Well!
(JP WHISTLES)

1675
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:49,627
Well Cole, what are you going to do?
What can I do?

1676
02:03:49,715 --> 02:03:51,791
Can't argue with a closed door.

1677
02:03:51,884 --> 02:03:54,553
Glad to hear you say that.
Better just drop the whole thing.

1678
02:03:54,584 --> 02:03:55,676
Well what can I...

1679
02:03:55,707 --> 02:03:57,786
Some other fool would just go down
there and try talking her out of it.

1680
02:03:57,848 --> 02:03:59,418
You can get into a lot
of trouble with women

1681
02:03:59,449 --> 02:04:00,879
like that. Remember
what happened to me.

1682
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:03,935
You tryin' to say that I'm in
the same mess you were?

1683
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:05,728
Why no, I didn't
say that, Cole.

1684
02:04:05,814 --> 02:04:08,518
You think I'm gonna make a
fool out of myself like you did?

1685
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:11,977
Cole, you told me yourself, you cannot
stand to be tied down in one place.

1686
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:14,366
How do you know I haven't
had enough of running

1687
02:04:14,397 --> 02:04:16,596
around selling my gun
arm all over the place.

1688
02:04:16,657 --> 02:04:18,697
You said yourself sittin'
right here on this desk that...

1689
02:04:18,784 --> 02:04:21,026
Don't put words in my mouth...
I'm not putting words in your mouth!

1690
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:25,497
And if I'm gonna have somebody tell me
about women, it isn't going to be you.

1691
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:27,741
Where is Maudie?
Down at her place.

1692
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:30,041
That's my crutch.
Well, where's the other one?

1693
02:04:30,129 --> 02:04:32,417
Right over there,
right under your nose.

1694
02:04:32,589 --> 02:04:35,792
I can't make up my own mind!
You got it under the wrong arm, Cole.

1695
02:04:36,468 --> 02:04:42,091
Well, how would you know? You've been using
it first under one arm and then the other.

1696
02:04:42,223 --> 02:04:47,265
Fine friend! Trying to keep a fellow
from doing what he wants to do.

1697
02:04:47,764 --> 02:04:49,824
(JP LAUGHS)

1698
02:04:49,939 --> 02:04:53,023
I reckon' the way to get him to do
something is to tell him not to do it.

1699
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:55,232
Not if he didn't want to
do it in the first place.

1700
02:04:55,319 --> 02:04:58,106
Reckon he'll stay here?
Yeah, could be.

1701
02:04:58,197 --> 02:05:00,866
Be a good thing to have him here.

1702
02:05:00,949 --> 02:05:05,077
Suppose you'll likely to wait a bit,
find a new gal,

1703
02:05:05,162 --> 02:05:07,404
make a fool of yourself
all over again.

1704
02:05:07,497 --> 02:05:11,246
Most likely. If you leave me,
Bull, I could be driven to it.

1705
02:05:11,334 --> 02:05:14,205
Well, I ain't said I was gonna leave ya.
You as much as said it.

1706
02:05:14,295 --> 02:05:16,621
Now, stop putting
words in my mouth.

1707
02:05:16,714 --> 02:05:20,379
I just can't do anything right
according to you. Bull, I need you.

1708
02:05:20,468 --> 02:05:22,793
You what?
I need you, Bull.

1709
02:05:22,887 --> 02:05:26,090
Well, now if you start being nice
to me, I'll quit you for sure.

1710
02:05:26,182 --> 02:05:30,511
Shock'd be too much. I'd as sooner
have you hungover and nasty.

1711
02:05:30,603 --> 02:05:34,600
Speaking of that,
how about a little drink, Bull?

1712
02:05:35,899 --> 02:05:39,600
Darn it! Took you a long time
to think of that one.

1713
02:05:41,697 --> 02:05:46,026
That was good work, sheriff.
Thank you, friend.

1714
02:05:46,117 --> 02:05:50,660
Sheriff, it looks like
you're going to keep your job.

1715
02:05:50,747 --> 02:05:54,531
Yeah, it'll be a nice quiet town
after you leave, Cole.

1716
02:05:54,625 --> 02:05:56,867
How do you know I'm leaving?

1717
02:05:56,961 --> 02:06:00,460
We just don't need
your kind around here.
