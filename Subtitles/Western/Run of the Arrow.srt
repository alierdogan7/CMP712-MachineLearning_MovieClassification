1
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:28,979
Ain't that Traveller?

2
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,400
I said, ain't that Lee's horse?
- Yes.

3
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
What's Lee doing here?

4
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
He's surrendering to Grant.

5
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,300
Lead looks close to the heart.

6
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,200
That's the first Yankee
I've missed in 4 years.

7
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,005
Bet it's because the bullet's warped.

8
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,783
Why didn't you cut it out yourself?
- I didn't want to dirty my hands!

9
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:55,105
Why didn't you leave him
to bleed to death?

10
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:58,000
There's General Lee.
He's still got his sword.

11
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:01,112
Grant must have let him keep it.
- Maybe he wouldn't give it up!

12
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:05,161
We lost the war, soldier.
Lee has struck his last tent.

13
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:14,192
So there he is, the great and
glorious General Grant.

14
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:32,407
If you're gonna shoot Grant,
you'd better shoot Lee too,

15
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,391
else the shame'll kill him.

16
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:03,172
Just like I said.

17
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,019
Like I said from the beginning,
the bullet's warped, warped.

18
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,489
It's the last bullet
shot in this war.

19
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:19,815
# I'm an old rebel soldier

20
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:22,746
# And that's just what I am

21
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,200
# And for this Yankee nation

22
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,900
# I do not give a damn

23
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,182
# I hate the starry banner

24
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:35,511
# It's stained with Southern blood

25
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,345
# And I hate the poisoned Yankees

26
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,895
# And I fought 'em all I could

27
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,295
# I hate the Yankee nation

28
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:52,021
# And the uniform of blue

29
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,603
# I hate the constitution

30
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:59,072
# Of this great republic too

31
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,544
# I hate the mighty gold

32
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:06,406
# With all its brass and fuss

33
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:10,901
# Oh, those evil, lying Yankees

34
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,515
# I hate 'em worse and worse

35
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:22,285
# I can't take up my musket

36
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,471
# And fight 'em any more

37
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:28,436
# But I ain't gonna love 'em

38
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:31,297
# And that is mighty sure

39
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:34,996
# And I don't want no pardon

40
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,786
# For what I've done around

41
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,284
# And I won't be reconstructed

42
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:43,361
# And I do not give a damn! #

43
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,432
Let me get out of this thing.

44
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,267
Thank you.

45
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,975
Well, he went and done it.

46
00:07:56,947 --> 00:08:01,100
General Lee got right down
on his hands and knees

47
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,290
and begged President Johnson
for pardon.

48
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:11,222
But if it's good enough for them,
I reckon it's good enough for me.

49
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,623
He never begged.

50
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,932
He never begged?
I wish you was right.

51
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,969
What makes you so sure?

52
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,770
When I went back to town to get that
bullet, I heard it official

53
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,388
that
he swallowed his pride and begged.

54
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:31,319
What bullet?

55
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,284
The bullet you had
cut out of that Yankee Lieutenant

56
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:37,308
you shot
the last day of the war.

57
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:40,886
How'd you get this?
- Your ma gave it to us.

58
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:44,900
Why?
- Well...

59
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:47,045
...look at that.

60
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:51,593
That ain't the bullet. That's new.
- All but the head. It's been fixed.

61
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:53,237
There's writing on it.

62
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:56,195
Writing? What kind of writing?
- It says...

63
00:08:56,315 --> 00:09:00,433
"Private O'Meara,
Sixth Virginia Volunteers,

64
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:04,972
"who shot this last bullet
in war...

65
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,443
"...and missed!"

66
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,427
It's a little token.
It's a little token from us to you.

67
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:22,583
But the best news...

68
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:27,835
the best news was when your ma said
that you'd come home in one piece.

69
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:32,573
Best news I got was when Lincoln
was dead. What's the matter, Mama?

70
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:36,567
A man shows respect even for
a dead, damn-Yankee President.

71
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:41,254
Lost your reason?
The baboon was shot too late.

72
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:44,723
The bullet that killed him may prove
worse for us than for the North.

73
00:09:45,357 --> 00:09:47,042
You sound sick in the head.

74
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:50,417
He said he'd take us back in the Union.

75
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:53,710
Who cares about the Union?
- Lots of us do, son.

76
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:56,032
I know it's a shame to take

77
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:59,299
the Oath of Allegiance to
become Americans again...

78
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,443
Jeff Davis is in jail.

79
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:06,451
Lee's begging in the mud. A fine
way to take us back into the Union.

80
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,149
No man's beaten without some hatred.

81
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,754
And I hate, Mama.

82
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:16,057
I hate!

83
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:19,742
I don't understand you, Ma.

84
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,443
Pa was killed at Chickamauga.

85
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:27,197
Jed had his head cut off
at Fredericksburg.

86
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:33,275
Eli. Eli lay with his belly
in his hand,

87
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,921
bleeding to death
in the wheat fields of Gettysburg.

88
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,297
Mama, I know. I seen them.

89
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,171
I seen their skin and blood
and I buried them.

90
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:51,805
I had to bury 'em, Mama.
I buried 'em, you didn't.

91
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:56,233
What am I supposed to say now
to the Yankees?

92
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,285
"Welcome home, sir?

93
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,051
"I love you Yankees?!"

94
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:10,267
How did you... how did you
expect me to come home?

95
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:13,088
I expected you to come home
a man with honour.

96
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,290
A man with honour?

97
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,991
You expected me to come home
with honour?!

98
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,177
What's the matter with you?

99
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:31,064
What's the matter with all of you?
They came and took our land!

100
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,734
They chased us when we had no legs!

101
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:37,972
They stuffed their mouths with our
food when we were starving to death.

102
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,483
Where's your pride?!

103
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:45,358
What's happened to all of you?

104
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:48,611
We had to take a lickin' and not cry.

105
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:51,376
You don't have to fight
for the cause no more.

106
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:53,171
Mama, I don't have to do anything.

107
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:56,243
I don't have to do anything.

108
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,290
I am a rebel because I want to be,
not because I have to be.

109
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:05,537
Wherever you go,
there's gonna be Yankees

110
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,341
and you gotta learn to live with them.

111
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:09,631
Not the place I'll be.

112
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,103
What place?
- The West. The Far West.

113
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,006
Where the savages live?

114
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,321
Savages or no, they
have more pride than us.

115
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:21,292
There's no hiding place
for what ails you, son.

116
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,166
We're all under one flag now.

117
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,005
I want to tell you something, Mother.

118
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:31,272
I'll hang.

119
00:12:32,582 --> 00:12:34,525
I'll hang before I recognise that flag.

120
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,125
Maybe a broken neck is the best
answer for what ails you.

121
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,793
Maybe, Mama.

122
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:51,790
Maybe!

123
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:24,654
What a darn fool way
to waste good whisky.

124
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,566
That's fine whisky!

125
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:38,196
The buzzards was all prepared
to peck your eyes out.

126
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,483
Take it from an old army scout. Any
closer, I'd have bit their heads off.

127
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:46,506
A Sioux scout for the damn Yankees?

128
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:50,528
Confederate States of America.

129
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:57,576
Still fighting the war,
Mr Johnny Sore-Loser?

130
00:14:58,709 --> 00:14:59,789
I want to tell you something.

131
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:03,592
You'd better get one thing straight, old man.

132
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:06,683
You may be old, but
you're not ready to be buried yet.

133
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:13,283
Maybe, but I will be
when I run out of whisky.

134
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,915
I'm carrying a bad heart.

135
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:18,473
Going home to die.

136
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,942
Where you heading?
- Anywhere.

137
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,476
Now "anywhere" can be with me
until I run dry.

138
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:34,170
US Cavalry. That's a nice piece
of Yankee horseflesh you got there.

139
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,355
That's right.

140
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:42,814
Plenty of land out here
in this Sioux country.

141
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,285
Not for the white men.

142
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:47,794
Maybe they could use an
unemployed Confederate sharpshooter.

143
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:49,765
That's renegade talk.

144
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:52,789
My name's O'Meara.

145
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:54,827
What's yours?

146
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,027
- Walking Coyote.
- Walking Coyote.

147
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:59,654
What outfit? Georgia Cavalry?

148
00:15:59,774 --> 00:16:03,528
No, it's the Virginia
Infantry. Let's get that straight.

149
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,385
Infantry?
- That's right.

150
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,785
Well, what's so funny?
- Only squaws walk.

151
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:21,049
Get up, boy. Hey!

152
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,684
What was the name of that tune
you just played?

153
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,492
It's a love song.

154
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,970
It's a darling tune,
in spite of the way you played it.

155
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,871
It's for lovin'.

156
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:51,854
Have you got a squaw?
- No.

157
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:56,485
You?
- No.

158
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,835
Sometimes I feel it might be better

159
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,264
to curl up with a squaw around
a fireplace rather than a saddle.

160
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,015
Well, I wouldn't argue with you
on that point.

161
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:14,979
Listen, erm... how many tribes
are there in your nation?

162
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,375
We're divided into three divisions.

163
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:22,859
The Santee, the Yankton
and the Teton.

164
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:28,732
I'm an Oglala. That's one of the
seven tribes of the Teton Sioux.

165
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:33,524
Every tribe has a lot of bands.
Every band has a chief.

166
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:36,825
I could have been a chief.

167
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,403
What's Sioux mean in your language?

168
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,565
It's a French word.
- French word?

169
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:43,873
Yeah. Our real name is Lakota.

170
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:49,494
Before scalping was the thing to do,
we used to slit our enemies' throats.

171
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:55,146
What's that got to do with the French?
- We fought the Chippewa,

172
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,860
and when they tied up
with the French,

173
00:18:56,891 --> 00:19:01,638
they told 'em we were...
Sioux. Sioux means cut-throat.

174
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,116
Why are you so interested in Sioux?
- I don't know.

175
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,138
I'd like to be one.

176
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:13,543
Why?
- Because.

177
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:19,141
Because cut-throats
should stick together.

178
00:19:20,356 --> 00:19:21,826
You serious?
- I'm serious.

179
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:24,930
Nah!
- I'd like to learn your language.

180
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,196
I'd like to learn it to
you, if St Christopher

181
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:28,665
will keep you in one piece.

182
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:32,070
You like St Christopher?
- Yeah.

183
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:37,258
Are you a Christian?
- No. My religion is Yawippe.

184
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,135
Yawippe?
Hey, Yawippe.

185
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,145
That's sort of a denomination?
- Yeah.

186
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:46,491
You said you could've been a Sioux chief.

187
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,151
That's true.
- Why didn't you?

188
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,942
I can't stomach politics!

189
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,775
Get up, boy.

190
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,998
Let's go now.

191
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,630
What's the horse's head for?

192
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,002
That's so he'll have
his pony to ride when

193
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:41,773
he gets to the happy hunting ground.

194
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,386
Oh, look!

195
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:48,538
What's that there?

196
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:53,625
Another Sioux post office?
- Yeah.

197
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,286
Three more babies born
to the Minneconjou tribe.

198
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:01,698
You picked up our customs quick.

199
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:03,330
It's not so difficult, you know.

200
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:07,092
Wait a minute.

201
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,303
It's the sign of a small party.
8 or 10 riding light.

202
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:12,693
Sioux ponies.

203
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,545
I don't see a sign of 'em.

204
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:20,417
When you can't see 'em,
they're looking at you.

205
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,164
Don't touch your gun.

206
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:03,711
- What, leave myself wide open?
- Don't touch it.

207
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:09,488
Turn around, slow like,
and keep your mouth shut.

208
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:11,155
Turn.

209
00:22:33,193 --> 00:22:37,134
That man is no enemy of the Sioux.
- His horse wears the US enemy brand.

210
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:42,003
Who are you?
- Walking Coyote. One of your tribe.

211
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:44,600
Walking Coyote.
- Yes.

212
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,678
I've heard about you. A renegade
paid by the whites to kill us.

213
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:55,904
Me kill a Sioux? I'm a Sioux.
I came home to my tribe.

214
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,431
You have no tribe.

215
00:22:57,551 --> 00:23:01,300
That's up to Blue Buffalo to decide.
He is still your chief?

216
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:06,489
Yes, but it's up to me to decide.
Me, Crazy Wolf.

217
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:11,036
We're gonna hang you, old man.
- I demand a hearing!

218
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:28,695
Drunk and mean, all of 'em,
and painted for trouble.

219
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,969
In my day we showed
a little respect for the aged.

220
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,990
I don't know what the world
is coming to nowadays.

221
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,962
These young bucks run wild,
drink whisky, loot lodges, attack girls.

222
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,691
They look like they're
getting ready to hang you.

223
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,240
You learned our lingo good.

224
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:02,420
Too good. Otherwise I wouldn't be

225
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,241
sweating out the fact
they're gonna skin me.

226
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,300
You're lucky to be going that way
even though it takes longer dying.

227
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,100
I wish they'd carve me alive.
- What?

228
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:18,300
In my religion, you don't
get to heaven if you're hanged.

229
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,500
We're faster
than the Run Of The Arrow!

230
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:39,993
- YO!
- It worked.

231
00:24:49,314 --> 00:24:51,204
They ask for the Run!

232
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:21,551
Come on.

233
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:29,567
Why'd they let us go?
- Save your wind.

234
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,373
Put that arrow down!

235
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:38,768
Even to a renegade and a white,
we do not violate the Run!

236
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:43,169
What's he mean "violate the Run"?

237
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,997
A man could get skinned alive from
sunset to sunrise if he violated it.

238
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,406
This game is called Run Of The Arrow.

239
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:56,834
When we get to the spot where
his arrow fell, we start running.

240
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:58,845
They run after us.

241
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:01,584
On foot?
- Yeah.

242
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,257
Except they're not barefoot like us.

243
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:08,050
He fired it quite a way. Maybe
we've got a chance.

244
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:09,413
That's the idea.

245
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,558
They torture us with the chance
to make an escape.

246
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,400
You can't outrun them.

247
00:26:20,994 --> 00:26:22,074
You're too old.

248
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:24,517
You ain't.

249
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,667
There's one thing
I gotta tell you, son.

250
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:36,686
Nobody ever made the Run,
and lived to tell about it.

251
00:26:51,146 --> 00:26:54,547
Now if we can just keep
this distance between them and us,

252
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,971
stay out of bow shot,
we've got a running chance.

253
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:02,454
But you see what Crazy Wolf
can do with an arrow,

254
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:04,857
so don't let
him get a bow range on you.

255
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:12,911
Well... I want to say...

256
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:16,799
...I think it's a shame that...

257
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,309
Yeah, it's a pity.

258
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:24,970
Well... just pray to God
and start running!

259
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:42,449
Have you seen a white man running?

260
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,418
Have you?

261
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,871
Have you seen a white man?

262
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,000
You speak our language
without an accent.

263
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,669
You do not speak Sioux like an American.

264
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:37,528
I'm not an American.
I was running...

265
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,903
I was running...
- You must be quiet.

266
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:43,145
How many guards are there?

267
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:47,991
No-one knows you are here.
No-one knows but Silent Tongue.

268
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:54,717
He can't speak.
He was born without voice.

269
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:58,767
Is that your son?
- No, his people are dead.

270
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,343
You know what it means
to violate the Run?

271
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,972
I know.

272
00:34:56,709 --> 00:35:00,448
I wish... I wish to speak
to your chief, Blue Buffalo.

273
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,575
I'm Blue Buffalo.

274
00:35:09,979 --> 00:35:11,679
I've lived the Run Of The Arrow.

275
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:22,789
Is this the man who outran you?

276
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:28,574
Yes.
- You're the first to live the Run.

277
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,807
You'll never die by the hands
of the Sioux. Give back his horse.

278
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:39,045
You speak like a Sioux, not a white man.
- My teacher was Walking Coyote.

279
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:40,948
Oh, that poor renegade.

280
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:52,065
He's sick with the fever.

281
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,338
Our law prevents us from killing
any man who has lived the Run,

282
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,240
but we have no law
to help him live.

283
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,182
The choice is yours. Who among you
will help him through the night?

284
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:05,453
I will.

285
00:36:11,756 --> 00:36:14,267
I will help him through the night.

286
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:27,365
They're heading through
the wheat field. Use the rifle.

287
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:32,669
Pick up his head.
That's my brother!

288
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:37,122
Lee begged. Lee begged.

289
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:40,726
Where's Pickett?
Where's Longstreet?

290
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:43,656
Watch out, Pa!

291
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:46,221
Bury the bodies, Ma.

292
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,474
If she can keep him in there all night

293
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:54,041
and steam that fever out of
him, I think then maybe he'll live.

294
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,171
Bury Pa.

295
00:36:58,562 --> 00:36:59,780
And bury Jed.

296
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:03,053
And bury Eli.

297
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,408
Bury them bodies, Ma.

298
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,337
Is that for me?

299
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,384
Thank you.

300
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,337
What's the matter with him?

301
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:42,484
Among our people,
when one takes something,

302
00:37:42,604 --> 00:37:44,615
one gives something in return.

303
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:47,067
Oh.

304
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:52,400
Blow.

305
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,584
That is the first sound
to ever come from his mouth.

306
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:09,218
What does it mean - "honeymoon"?

307
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,446
Honeymoon, huh?
- Yeah.

308
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:14,714
Why are you laughing?

309
00:38:14,977 --> 00:38:16,673
- You wanna know what it means?
- Yes.

310
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:17,515
Honeymoon?

311
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:20,894
- Yes.
- Well, honeymoon is, er...

312
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,432
Yeah. Honeymoon
is a white man's word...

313
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:33,321
Honeymoon is a white man's word
for the...

314
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,750
...for the private passing of time

315
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:39,265
between two people after
they've been married.

316
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,292
Understand, huh?
- Yes.

317
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:07,167
He's here.

318
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:28,542
He wants to become a Sioux,

319
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:32,104
to take Yellow Moccasin
as his squaw

320
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,378
and to adopt
Silent Tongue as their son.

321
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,335
But his skin is enemy.
- I'm not an American.

322
00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:42,384
But your skin is white.
- But my heart's with the Sioux.

323
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:43,939
Why?

324
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,426
Because I love your people.

325
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:52,139
I've learnt from Yellow Moccasin
that a man can't live alone.

326
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:57,764
He must have allegiance
to a people, to a nation.

327
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,787
In my heart my nation is Sioux.

328
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,157
Would you kill the Americans
in battle?

329
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:10,610
Yes.

330
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:17,484
Are there any objections?

331
00:40:20,144 --> 00:40:21,002
Mix the blood.

332
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:23,553
Before you mix the blood,
I must speak of my faith.

333
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:24,269
Faith?

334
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,806
- Yes.
- What do you mean?

335
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:27,588
I'm a Christian.

336
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:33,791
I will live as a Sioux.
I will hunt as a Sioux.

337
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:37,656
I will fight.
I will even die as a Sioux.

338
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:43,002
But my God is a Christian God.
I can't serve your greater spirit.

339
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,942
We respect a man
who respects his faith.

340
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:56,490
This God of yours, is he the giver
and creator of all life?

341
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:58,439
Yes.

342
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,881
Do you look to him for the
cure of disease and illness

343
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:06,092
and to make you strong and healthy?
- I do, yes.

344
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:09,818
How many Gods do you serve?

345
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:11,923
Do you have more than one?
- No, no.

346
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:14,092
Just one.
- Just one.

347
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:19,410
Americans - are they all Christians?

348
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:24,215
No, some are. Some are of other
denominations like your religions.

349
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:30,862
You are a Christian.

350
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:33,966
Would you kill Christians in battle?

351
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:39,285
Well...

352
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:48,027
...My nation fought for liberty
against the United States...

353
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:54,506
...and Christianity is always
the brother of liberty in all wars.

354
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:03,019
We have the same god
but with a different name.

355
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,420
Mix the blood.

356
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:10,448
The things you feel in your hearts
for one another

357
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:13,065
will mark your
feelings for the rest of your life.

358
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:17,196
Marriage is the beginning
of life for both of you.

359
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:19,792
Death is the final parting.

360
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:23,153
Now you are two bodies in one blood.

361
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,603
So many times I've asked.

362
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,277
Why won't you tell me
what you carry in that?

363
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:45,407
I'll tell you.
It's a bullet.

364
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:50,874
It's a bullet that was used
in the war with the white men.

365
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:52,803
Why do you carry it?

366
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:56,947
Because it was a trophy
that was given to me

367
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:59,739
by the people of my village -
a war trophy.

368
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:06,350
It's got writing on it.
- Writing?

369
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,889
Writing
- like the signs on our tepees.

370
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:13,814
Wanna hear what it says?
- Yes.

371
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:17,866
It says, "To Private O'Meara,
Sixth Virginia Volunteers,

372
00:43:17,986 --> 00:43:20,402
who
shot this last bullet in the war...

373
00:43:20,888 --> 00:43:22,116
"...and missed."

374
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:35,381
Uncover the guidon and flag!

375
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:47,018
Sound the bugle
and put spit into it!

376
00:44:26,323 --> 00:44:29,551
Lieutenant Driscoll, commanding
B Troop, Second Cavalry,

377
00:44:29,671 --> 00:44:32,764
First
Division, reporting to Col Taylor.

378
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:37,562
Glad to meet you. Compliments
for being selected for this mission.

379
00:44:37,682 --> 00:44:40,682
Nothing complimentary about wet-nursing engineers

380
00:44:40,802 --> 00:44:44,900
and carpenters.
- Itching for combat?

381
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,546
That's what I'm paid for.
- You're paid to escort

382
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:53,882
a non-combatant train.
Capt Clark is the boss of that train.

383
00:44:55,253 --> 00:44:59,405
May I ask about the area?
- If we can come to terms with the Sioux,

384
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:02,535
that area will be designated by
Chief Red Cloud and General Allan.

385
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:05,656
I thought we had that Indian on
his knees begging for terms.

386
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:11,191
You've read too many
Eastern newspapers.

387
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:13,547
B Troop can make that Indian beg.

388
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:18,339
A young officer at Port Phil Kearny

389
00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:22,051
had the same sickness you've got,
Lieutenant. His name was Fetterman.

390
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:26,641
He said he could ride through
the Sioux nation with 80 men.

391
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:31,060
He tried it.

392
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:36,602
81 men were massacred by the Sioux.

393
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,081
Capt Fetterman was infantry, sir.

394
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:41,961
It would've been different if he'd
had some cavalry to back him up.

395
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:47,995
For your information, we're the ones
asking Red Cloud to meet our terms.

396
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:52,112
See to your men.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:58,970
We break our backs making
peace with the Indians

398
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,856
and they send us
men like that, scratching for combat.

399
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:07,469
I guess he's not the only
frustrated Custer in the army.

400
00:46:58,477 --> 00:47:00,972
Like you, General Allan,
we're tired of fighting.

401
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:03,618
Why can't we come to terms?

402
00:47:05,778 --> 00:47:07,550
Your request?

403
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:10,300
Permission from Chief Red
Cloud to build Fort Lincoln...

404
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,859
What has the United States
promised your people?

405
00:47:13,642 --> 00:47:16,247
To keep the road open
to the Montana goldfields.

406
00:47:17,772 --> 00:47:21,066
I can't give you permission
to build this fort. - Why?

407
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:24,580
If I let you build this fort,
you will frighten away our buffalo.

408
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,254
We'll have to eat dogs.
- We do not go through your hunting territory.

409
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,645
And the fort?

410
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:34,664
It will be built where you and I agree.
- There is one condition.

411
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:35,931
What's that?

412
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:39,050
One of my warriors must
scout for your people.

413
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:42,380
We already have 3 Indian scouts.

414
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,708
But they're not Sioux.

415
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:48,186
They're Delaware, Kiowa, Kwahadi
Comanche, but they're not Sioux.

416
00:47:49,252 --> 00:47:51,642
Then you don't trust them, eh?
- No.

417
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:57,358
My warrior knows the country.
He knows where our buffalo is.

418
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,854
He speaks your language
like a white man,

419
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:03,871
and he is not like your Indian scouts.

420
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,136
What's most important - he's a Sioux.

421
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:15,732
This is the scout I've selected.
He'll be my voice on the expedition.

422
00:48:15,962 --> 00:48:20,187
He has no love for the Americans,
but his word is the word of a Sioux.

423
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,055
Every officer, soldier and civilian

424
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:27,700
will obey his instructions as to
trails to follow, where to camp,

425
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,433
and where to build the fort.

426
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:35,200
General Allan speaks for the
President. You have heard his words.

427
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:38,581
Glad to have you scout
for the American Govt.

428
00:48:38,701 --> 00:48:42,250
I scout for the Sioux.

429
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,500
It's the first time I
ever met an Irish Indian.

430
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:48,253
It's the first time I
ever met a Yankee General.

431
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:53,045
This is Captain Clark, army engineers.

432
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:55,699
He'll be in command.

433
00:48:56,942 --> 00:49:00,883
Lieutenant Driscoll, commanding B
Troop, will escort the expedition.

434
00:49:25,335 --> 00:49:26,961
There's a wire cut on this hock joint.

435
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,600
I treated that cut
myself. This is my horse.

436
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,592
I know.

437
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:32,500
- What?
- I took him from you.

438
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,007
You took him from me?
- That's right.

439
00:49:34,127 --> 00:49:38,569
I'm the Johnny Reb that fired the
last bullet of the war right there.

440
00:49:45,008 --> 00:49:51,000
Was there any trouble?
- No. No, there was no trouble.

441
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:55,284
Red Cloud agreed to build a fort.
I think he's making a big mistake.

442
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:56,525
I've got to go scout with them.

443
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,442
Make sure they stay
out of our meat country.

444
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,655
Will there be many soldiers?
- No, it's a peaceful expedition.

445
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:04,400
Then we don't have to be
left behind in the village.

446
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,303
I don't think so.

447
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:06,990
You know what a bad cook I am!

448
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,364
Is something wrong

449
00:50:11,484 --> 00:50:15,009
between you and that man?
- Yes.

450
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,539
Do you know him from the war?
- Yeah.

451
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,698
I shot him with that bullet.

452
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:26,612
Does he know it was you
who shot him? - Yes.

453
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:29,786
When you wounded him,
why did you bring him

454
00:50:29,906 --> 00:50:31,742
to your medicine man to be healed?

455
00:50:33,348 --> 00:50:34,428
I don't know.

456
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:39,248
A Sioux wouldn't save an enemy.
- Well, you saved me, didn't you?

457
00:50:39,368 --> 00:50:43,041
I didn't try to kill you.
- That's right.

458
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:32,658
Wheeler got hit.
- What's that?

459
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:35,978
Wheeler's hit.
Arrow in his back.

460
00:52:41,806 --> 00:52:44,682
He was killed inside the corridor.
- That's right.

461
00:52:46,045 --> 00:52:48,183
What report do I send back now?

462
00:52:49,438 --> 00:52:53,312
That this is an arrow belongs
to an Indian named Crazy Wolf.

463
00:52:54,311 --> 00:52:57,942
Is he a Sioux?
- Yes, yes, he's a Sioux.

464
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:01,033
And he's a renegade.

465
00:53:01,315 --> 00:53:02,760
Red Cloud didn't waste any time.

466
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,677
Crazy Wolf was acting on his own.

467
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:07,977
Why?
- He doesn't trust the white man.

468
00:53:08,097 --> 00:53:11,365
Do you?
- I just don't trust Yankees, that's all.

469
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:16,643
We haven't broken our word.

470
00:53:18,714 --> 00:53:20,604
I'm here to see that you don't.
- I'm gonna run down Red Cloud...

471
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:23,641
He had nothing to do with it..
- I'll go along with that.

472
00:53:23,925 --> 00:53:26,260
How can you take the word of this Reb?!

473
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,460
String him up, and his squaw.

474
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,164
I'll tell you when to hang a man.

475
00:53:30,515 --> 00:53:33,336
Do we go after them?
- No, we don't.

476
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,237
I came up from the ranks, Captain.
I had respect for West Point.

477
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,991
I didn't know they turned out
officers to be Indian lovers.

478
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:50,708
You trust Red Cloud, don't you?
- Yeah.

479
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:54,069
More important right now, I trust you.

480
00:53:54,704 --> 00:53:56,897
Come on.
We've still got a fort to build.

481
00:54:16,406 --> 00:54:17,917
All right, look now.

482
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:20,374
We'll bivouac here.

483
00:54:21,197 --> 00:54:26,024
And stay away from the quicksand
there. Quicksand right there.

484
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:56,649
I don't understand Driscoll.
Putting cowpokes in B Troop.

485
00:54:56,769 --> 00:55:02,727
Nothing cavalry about them.
They don't ride cavalry like us.

486
00:55:02,847 --> 00:55:04,009
Driscoll wants fighters.

487
00:55:04,129 --> 00:55:07,076
- He's got 'em.
- Yes, he has.

488
00:55:10,734 --> 00:55:13,884
I wish that kid would stop
playing that mouth-organ.

489
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:17,628
Let's get some grub.

490
00:55:29,065 --> 00:55:30,294
Take it easy, boy.

491
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:32,762
Take it easy.

492
00:55:35,718 --> 00:55:39,045
Give me your hand, boy.
Come on. Give me your hand.

493
00:56:14,394 --> 00:56:18,229
Wait a minute, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:21,152
I don't care why they
made it this way.

495
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:26,302
It's a medieval torture rack.
My stern can't stand it one more day.

496
00:56:26,422 --> 00:56:28,068
You see that?
- Yes, sir.

497
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:31,777
The McClellan saddle
favours the animal.

498
00:56:31,897 --> 00:56:32,795
We in the cavalry...

499
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:37,518
I don't care about the
cavalry! Just fill up that hole.

500
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:38,938
Put something in it!

501
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:42,490
See what you can do to make it
a little friendly, Corporal.

502
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,528
Yes, sir.

503
00:56:48,392 --> 00:56:49,391
Horses.

504
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,844
How's the boy, all right?
- He's fine, fine.

505
00:56:56,882 --> 00:57:00,580
About the Sergeant, sir... I'd like
to say something about that, sir.

506
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,099
I'm sorry I didn't...

507
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:05,275
I guess there's just some
things I don't quite understand.

508
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,190
Well, Yankees are human.

509
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:14,350
You're not the only Johnny Reb

510
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:16,851
fighting a one-man war against
the United States, you know.

511
00:57:20,356 --> 00:57:24,918
Some of them went down to
South America. - I know, sir.

512
00:57:25,188 --> 00:57:26,120
Why didn't you?

513
00:57:27,186 --> 00:57:31,478
I guess because I consider this country
not being part of the United States.

514
00:57:31,923 --> 00:57:35,338
Not now, but it will be pretty soon.

515
00:57:37,886 --> 00:57:39,076
What was your outfit? Sixth...?

516
00:57:39,196 --> 00:57:41,018
- Sixth Virginia Infantry.
- Infantry!

517
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:44,300
I don't have to tell you how
to fight a war,

518
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:47,767
but it's why there's
fighting. That's what's important.

519
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:49,102
Think we were wrong?

520
00:57:52,247 --> 00:57:55,104
Blood and kin and home are
worth fighting for,

521
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:58,521
but no man
can put that above his country...

522
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:03,055
You don't understand, sir. We had
a right to fight for our rights.

523
00:58:04,922 --> 00:58:08,217
Lincoln had to keep the Union together.
- No, Union be damned.

524
00:58:08,337 --> 00:58:12,600
You Northerners don't understand.
We don't like you making up laws.

525
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,570
We never liked it. Telling us what
to do and think, who to live with.

526
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,554
We'll fight it. We may
go down fighting,

527
00:58:22,674 --> 00:58:26,415
but we'll go down like
a free, white, Christian country.

528
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,299
Free, white and Christian, huh?

529
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:36,285
Burning crosses and hiding
under pillow-cases

530
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:37,715
and terrorising families,

531
00:58:37,835 --> 00:58:41,372
free, white and Christian?
- I don't know anything about that, sir.

532
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,858
Oh, yeah, it's always
the other fella.

533
00:58:49,785 --> 00:58:52,782
Captain, I'd like you
to understand something.

534
00:58:53,308 --> 00:58:55,440
No matter what you believe,

535
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,015
no matter how good you think it
is, you'll never make the South...

536
00:59:00,135 --> 00:59:03,659
Nobody's asking you
to be a Fourth Of July patriot,

537
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,293
but living like an Indian,
fighting your own people,

538
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:08,582
that's not gonna cure you.

539
00:59:08,865 --> 00:59:10,782
Cure me of what?
- Hate.

540
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:12,982
Blind hate.

541
00:59:15,616 --> 00:59:18,167
You ever hear that old story
about Philip Nolan?

542
00:59:18,694 --> 00:59:20,200
No, sir, I never did.

543
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:22,524
Well, Philip Nolan was a officer

544
00:59:22,644 --> 00:59:28,234
in the American army back
in... 1807, something like that.

545
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:31,827
He got himself mixed up with Aaron
Burr. You know Burr, the traitor?

546
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:34,827
Yeah, we read books in the South.

547
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,581
Anyway, he was like you.

548
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:43,305
Hated all the Americans...
for some reason or other.

549
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:46,200
So one day he upped and said,
"Damn the United States.

550
00:59:48,311 --> 00:59:51,000
"I wish I may never hear
of the United States again."

551
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:54,865
And he got his wish.

552
00:59:56,377 --> 00:59:59,752
They hang him?
- No, it was worse.

553
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,177
They kept him alive
on an American ship. 55 years.

554
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,400
55 years. He was known
as the man without a country.

555
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:17,743
Never saw his country again.
Died at sea.

556
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,781
What do you think of that?

557
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:28,733
I don't know, sir.
I'm a Reb.

558
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:33,967
And I'll die a Reb, even if

559
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:36,827
the North considers Lee's
surrender the death of the South.

560
01:00:38,874 --> 01:00:40,967
Let's get one thing straight -

561
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,900
Lee's surrender was NOT
the death of the South,

562
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,087
it was the birth
of the United States.

563
01:01:08,963 --> 01:01:10,478
What's the matter? Something wrong?

564
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,208
There's nothing wrong. Whoa, boy.

565
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:19,432
This is as far as I go, that's all.
- I guess we'd better get to work.

566
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,125
Stockwell.
- Yes, sir?

567
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,081
We build here.
- Yes, sir.

568
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,200
You're not serious?

569
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,150
What's that?
- Not gonna pitch that fort here?

570
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,576
This is the site they agreed on.
- 'Fraid of losing your bars?

571
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,800
Meaning what?

572
01:01:39,218 --> 01:01:42,297
If I was running this picnic, I'd
high-tail a courier back to Taylor

573
01:01:42,417 --> 01:01:44,187
and tell him this area stinks.

574
01:01:44,307 --> 01:01:46,023
You're not running this
picnic, so you'll take

575
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:48,464
orders or clean up after the mules.

576
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:51,130
Understand?
- Yes, sir.

577
01:01:53,263 --> 01:01:56,529
Order your troop to be at the
disposal of the engineers.

578
01:01:56,907 --> 01:01:58,351
That all?

579
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:00,650
No, stagger your men so some of 'em

580
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,300
hit the grub pile while the rest work.

581
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,341
Is that all, sir?
- That's all.

582
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:43,620
Excuse me, sir. I think we're
about ready to pull out now.

583
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,928
Oh, well...

584
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,032
I won't say thanks.

585
01:02:47,152 --> 01:02:49,719
You don't have to say thanks.
Nobody's obliged anybody, sir.

586
01:02:50,286 --> 01:02:52,405
What are you gonna do now?
Go back to your Sioux village?

587
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,810
That's right.

588
01:02:55,768 --> 01:02:57,671
Remember Nolan?

589
01:02:57,928 --> 01:03:01,572
Yes, I don't think it
hurts me the way it hurt him.

590
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,400
For your sake, I hope it doesn't.
Thank you.

591
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,391
You got plenty of grub?

592
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:09,158
- Yes, we'll manage nicely, sir.
- Good.

593
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,909
Well...
- Thank you, sir.

594
01:03:23,635 --> 01:03:25,430
The wood train's been attacked.

595
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:30,411
Six civilians and three troopers
killed. They took Private Dean alive.

596
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:02,443
The smoke signals that Reb sent to
his brass didn't stop any sniping.

597
01:04:03,104 --> 01:04:06,020
Can you read smoke signals?

598
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:09,705
You're playing into their hands.

599
01:04:22,027 --> 01:04:24,053
Don't use me to start a war.

600
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:10,091
Don't move. Don't move.
- Well, what are you waiting for?

601
01:05:11,832 --> 01:05:14,446
Take your moccasins off.
Come on.

602
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,779
Take them off. Take them off.

603
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:17,567
You violated the Run.
- What do you mean?

604
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:19,929
I gave him a chance
to run for his life.

605
01:06:45,108 --> 01:06:48,182
A disgrace to our nation. He killed
Americans inside the corridor.

606
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:52,151
Are they building the fort?
- Yes.

607
01:06:52,812 --> 01:06:56,198
I'm assuming full responsibility
for the change of area.

608
01:06:56,724 --> 01:07:01,533
If you pitch your posts here, every
detail will be ambushed.

609
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:05,866
You wanna
build your fort or your grave?

610
01:07:06,865 --> 01:07:09,241
I'll give you five minutes
to make up your mind.

611
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:38,661
There's nothing out in front, sir.
It's all clear.

612
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:41,200
Tell them to push forward

613
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,277
another five miles.
- Yes, sir.

614
01:08:46,476 --> 01:08:47,462
Let's go!

615
01:09:43,509 --> 01:09:44,874
I understand why Driscoll broke the pact

616
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:46,749
but I don't know why the others agreed.

617
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:49,043
It was always their plan!
- What plan?

618
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:51,001
To drive our buffalo away
and starve us to death!

619
01:09:51,335 --> 01:09:53,940
You think that killing them
will solve everything?

620
01:09:55,048 --> 01:09:57,572
At least it'll serve as a warning
to all the others.

621
01:09:58,356 --> 01:10:01,785
And you? What do you think?

622
01:10:04,202 --> 01:10:06,712
Would you kill the Americans
if we should go into battle?

623
01:10:07,387 --> 01:10:10,357
Well, they're in our meat country.

624
01:10:10,477 --> 01:10:13,398
They've gotta be stopped.
- Yes, but would you kill them?

625
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,395
I'm a Sioux.
- Are you?

626
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,782
I demand to lead
the first attack against them.

627
01:10:33,222 --> 01:10:38,216
You are a man of two countries,
but you can't kill Americans.

628
01:10:39,107 --> 01:10:44,387
If you kill or do not kill, you will
always be unhappy as a Sioux.

629
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:49,125
A man must choose to live
with his conscience.

630
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:56,859
In my heart you were never a Sioux.

631
01:10:57,224 --> 01:10:59,370
To all of us you were never a Sioux.

632
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:02,290
I was accepted as one.
- But never tested as one.

633
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:07,940
You were born an American
and what you were born you will die.

634
01:11:08,912 --> 01:11:10,436
I'll die a Sioux.

635
01:11:22,507 --> 01:11:25,408
You'll never get Captain's bars
looking for a scrap.

636
01:11:25,799 --> 01:11:27,230
Never get 'em dodging one.

637
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:30,838
They must've had a good reason
for holding you down to one bar.

638
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:33,362
I should have my own
regiment by this time.

639
01:11:33,591 --> 01:11:35,306
The brass don't agree with me.

640
01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:39,301
After this little picnic explodes,
I'll put myself in for Captain.

641
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:15,227
Three sides natural protection.
Rear and flanks impossible to hit.

642
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:20,000
One way to attack and we'll cover
that so well a division of Sioux...

643
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,930
It's outside the corridor.

644
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,981
Perfect observation.
Look at that field of fire.

645
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:27,505
We passed water and timber
you could spit at.

646
01:12:27,842 --> 01:12:33,427
What happens when Taylor hears?
- No, I'll come up fine in this.

647
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:37,219
You know why?
Because what I'm doing is right.

648
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:40,538
Find your best defensive position,

649
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:46,249
keep your troops in one fat piece.
That's how this site'll pay off.

650
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:19,324
That Johnny Reb's coming back again.

651
01:14:20,796 --> 01:14:23,387
Is he alone?
- Yes, sir.

652
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:24,886
Corporal.

653
01:15:07,437 --> 01:15:08,314
You've got five minutes

654
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:10,366
to surrender Fort Lincoln
to the Sioux nation.

655
01:15:11,946 --> 01:15:16,873
Hey, Trent, you see any Sioux?
- No, sir.

656
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:18,855
My look-out sees nothing.

657
01:15:18,975 --> 01:15:21,311
When you can't see 'em,
that's when you're looking at 'em.

658
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:26,787
You got brass for a Johnny Reb.
- I'm speaking for the Sioux.

659
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:31,634
What happens if we surrender?
- You'll be escorted to Col Taylor.

660
01:15:32,417 --> 01:15:35,306
Maybe you want my
trumpeter to play "Dixie"!

661
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:37,439
This ain't Appomattox.

662
01:15:37,722 --> 01:15:40,996
Four minutes to strike your flag.

663
01:15:41,253 --> 01:15:43,790
I never strike my flag
for an enemy, or a rebel.

664
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,317
Now put that in your peace pipe
and smoke it.

665
01:15:45,437 --> 01:15:47,855
Grow up, man and stop playing soldier!

666
01:15:47,975 --> 01:15:50,460
Give your men a chance
to save their scalps!

667
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,606
I'll give you the same chance
Grant gave Lee.

668
01:15:52,876 --> 01:15:55,614
You've got 60 seconds
to ride out of rifle range.

669
01:16:04,714 --> 01:16:06,793
There's two men you can listen to.

670
01:16:08,453 --> 01:16:12,171
One is me
and the other is Driscoll.

671
01:16:13,197 --> 01:16:17,152
You listen to me and I say move out
now if you want to save your scalp.

672
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:22,000
Listen to Driscoll and we'll have
your scalps in our belts by tomorrow.

673
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:23,799
He came under a flag of truce.

674
01:16:23,919 --> 01:16:24,549
Hang him.

675
01:16:24,669 --> 01:16:26,344
- For what?
- For treason.

676
01:16:42,595 --> 01:16:45,146
The left rear of the outpost is dead!
Cover it!

677
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,886
Judson, give me a hand!

678
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:10,520
For violating the Run,
I saved your life for this ceremony.

679
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,000
A Sioux can watch
an American skinned alive.

680
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,600
An American cannot watch.

681
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,800
They had a right, but not like that.
Someone had to be an executioner.

682
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,100
"They"?
You said, "they."

683
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:21,777
You didn't say "we"
had a right to his life.

684
01:23:24,612 --> 01:23:27,500
This is your flag.
- It's not my flag.

685
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:31,664
Is your tribe in this flag? Is it?

686
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,769
Yes.

687
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,559
Then it's your flag.

688
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,240
"Lee's surrender was not
the death of the South.

689
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:28,466
It was the birth
of the United States."
