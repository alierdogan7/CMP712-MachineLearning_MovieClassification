Maybe my gun ain't sighted proper.

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,443

You gotta lead on a running animal.

-Sew him up.

So long as God's breath is left in him...

All right, Captain.

37
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,950
I'll sew him up, make him look pretty.

He's only got one more river to cross.

How come a good hunter like Zach
tangled with a bear?

46
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:06,038
For a man who fought the demon whale,
to be killed by a grizzly...

47
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,958
He went in the brush
after a gut-shot critter.

It was just too high.

00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,100
Well?

52
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:31,938
Broken leg, sir,
three busted ribs, umpteen abrasions.

53
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:34,650
And he's lost enough blood
to drain a barrel.

54
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,319
Don't know what's keeping him breathing.

55

Oh, here's Zach's map
what we're traveling by, sir.

56
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,825
We must move on or the Indians will start
making our decisions for us.

57
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:45,577
Two years' work will go for nothing.

58
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,705
Zach's good as dead.
Can't risk all our lives staying here.

59
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,415
You're not going to leave him here alive,
are you, sir?

60
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,460
I want two men to stay behind
and bury him.

00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,955
Well, can I have what's left?

68
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,499

-Kill him.

''Now his fight's with you, God.''

anyhow.

01:17:44,677 --> 01:17:45,927
Fogarty.

357
01:17:46,804 --> 01:17:48,763
It's the men, sir.

358
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:50,223
I thought maybe you'd be interested

359
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:52,433
in knowing
what some of them's been talking about.

360
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:53,935
Like what?

361
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:59,023
Well, they've been saying
maybe we ought to burn the boat,

362
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:01,818
pack the skins on the mules,
work our way back.

363
01:18:01,985 --> 01:18:04,362
What do you think?

364
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:06,322
Well, sir, I don't know
what's so important about this boat.

365
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,616
I mean, without it,
well, we'd be clear of the snow

366
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,118
and onto flat lands by now.

367
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,121
Mr. Fogarty, that's more than just a boat.

368
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:16,916
It's what's left of my last command.
I don't intend to see it burn.

369
01:18:17,084 --> 01:18:19,585
-Now or ever.
-Yes, sir.

370
01:18:19,753 --> 01:18:22,964
But when we all signed on,
we figured there was a chance.

371
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:26,342
But not the way we're headed now.
I mean, what good is all them pelts

372
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:28,010
if we are dead?

373
01:18:28,178 --> 01:18:29,470
Winter's on us,

374
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:32,140
Rickarees just waiting to make their move,

375
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:33,641
and him.

376
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:37,395
Captain?

377
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:40,940
Do you think he's alive?

378
01:18:50,993 --> 01:18:54,162
Captain, what the hell's so special
about Zach Bass?

379
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,747
Why can't you let go of him?

380
01:18:55,914 --> 01:18:58,958
He's about the only man
I ever truly respected

381
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:00,668
or ever feared.

382
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,091
Zach was a stowaway.

383
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,928
He'd run off from an orphanage,

384
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:14,682
swam out to my ship in Boston Harbor.

385
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,770
I liked his unfearing look
and kept him on.

386
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,774
He'd become like a son to me.

387
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:25,526
Didn't see me as his father.

388
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:28,780
He learned young to live alone.
Be his own man.

389
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,158
All the years we was together,

390
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:33,868
never let me come close enough to ask

391
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:36,662
''What's on your mind, Zach,
what's bothering you?''

392
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:40,416
He drew a circle, like, around himself.

393
01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:42,460
Nobody dared enter it.

394
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:49,175
You do think he's alive,
don't you, Captain?

395
01:19:51,678 --> 01:19:53,679
Yes, Fogarty, he's alive.

396
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:57,016

399

You go back to hell, where you belong.

400
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,073

401
01:22:59,241 --> 01:23:02,576

407
01:23:33,483 --> 01:23:35,609
He's got a hole in his chest
as big as me fist.

408
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:37,486
Lowrie?

409
01:23:37,654 --> 01:23:39,697

410
01:23:39,865 --> 01:23:41,532

412

Well, it's done.

413
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,709
We'll bury him.

414
01:23:51,877 --> 01:23:53,586
