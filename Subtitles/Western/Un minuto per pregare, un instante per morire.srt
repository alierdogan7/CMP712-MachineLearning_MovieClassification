00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,205
You're hurt.

2
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,676
No, not a scratch.

3
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,504
Our lousy luck.

4
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,211
Well. You're still breathing.
aren't you?

5
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:49,514
DVDRIP - tetrao CST - Brasil 2009

6
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,644
Where's McCord?

7
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,381
What's he Worth alive?

8
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,083
$500... same as he is dead.

9
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,785
Good. He'll be a lot less trouble
that Way.

10
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,254
Their guns, Fred.

11
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,954
Y'all Were lookin' for a laugh?

12
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,217
Well. Maybe this'll tickle you.

13
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,264
Pa! Lie quiet. Pa.

14
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,042
Pa! You're hurting me. Pa!

15
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,070
Hey, Pete.

16
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,809
Listen to this...

17
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,986
Any and all outlaws who of
their own free will...

18
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,614
apply to the office of
Roy W. Colby...

19
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,523
U.S. Marshal, Town of Tascosa,
territory of New Mexico...

20
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,562
will be granted amnesty. Whereby
this government...

21
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,894
undertakes to wipe all crimes of
which they stand accused...

22
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,991
from the record henceforward
and forever.

23
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,900
Signed, Lemuel Carter, Governor.

24
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,805
Amnesty. l never thought l'd live
to see the day.

25
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,109
lt's rotten!

26
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,235
HoW come?

27
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,176
Man strays from the righteous path...

28
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,271
he has to be made to pay for it.

29
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,749
lt don't do tryin' to pretend that
a skunk don't smell.

30
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,139
Reach!

31
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,989
Take off your hat When a gentleman
enters the room.

32
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,593
Hey, Clay. These fellas must think
a lot of you.

33
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,618
They got your picture all over
the place.

34
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,789
Hey, l must be gettin' up in
the World.

35
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,457
Ten grand.

36
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,329
You're still only Worth $500.

37
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,006
l think l'm better-lookin' than
you are.

38
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,069
Yeah. Sure.

39
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,123
Stay put, fellas.

40
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,590
Right over there.

41
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,261
Hey, Fred.

42
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,000
Look at hoW sWeet they're
being to us.

43
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,662
Get some Whiskey for
Father Santana.

44
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,632
Plenty.

45
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,136
Come on, Fred. Let's go.

46
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,445
Hey, Beaver Head's to the north.

47
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,210
We're heading for the mission noW.

48
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,618
But We're being folloWed, Clay.

49
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,183
l need to see Santana.

50
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,287
Look, Clay. l don't like to
say anything...

51
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,389
but if it's about your arm,...

52
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,799
you'd be better off going to a
doctor than that priest.

53
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,963
Who said anything about my arm?

54
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,210
Hey!

55
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,915
The mission's that Way!

56
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,645
This Way's longer, but it's safer!

57
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,186
What about it, Santana?

58
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,654
He Won't talk.

59
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,469
Do like the good book says...

60
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,733
Knock, and it shall be opened
unto you.

61
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,979
Didn't you like the Whiskey the
man brought you?

62
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,016
What Whiskey? l don't drink.

63
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,890
McCord thinks different.

64
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,983
Took a Whole sleW of bottles
for you...

65
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,993
back at the mule station.

66
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,054
We come here to Wrap him up
in a box...

67
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,292
and hand him to the Marshal.

68
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,737
Thou shalt not kill, my son.

69
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,467
Unless there's a price on his head.

70
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,476
That makes it legal, instead
of just fun.

71
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,613
We're Working for the laW.

72
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,413
Listen good. Maybe We beat
McCord here.

73
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,577
But soon as he arrives...

74
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,383
you bring him right into
the church.

75
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,725
Get me?

76
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,250
Try to cross me, and l promise...

77
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,093
you've got a date upstairs With
your boss... for free.

78
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,865
Stay put here.

79
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,674
Hey, Padre...

80
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,905
l Wanna shoW you something make
you feel good.

81
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,172
l mean. You don't think We'd
drag a fella's body...

82
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,615
all over the place for Weeks before
We bury him, do you?

83
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,249
Not sanitary.

84
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,516
So. We just take his head.

85
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,404
l don't like that. Sean.

86
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,374
Bad luck to plug padres.

87
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,001
They're not Worth a cent.

88
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,239
Any priest buddies up
With an outlaW...

89
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,076
l automatically excommunicate him...

90
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,110
and ordain myself.

91
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,743
Not yet.

92
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,693
What'd We come here for?

93
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,026
So you could confess?

94
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,863
Get outside and keep him busy.

95
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,326
No priest's gonna cure What
ails you. Clay.

96
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,817
What you need is a real doctor.

97
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,232
Yeah. But priests keep their
mouths shut.

98
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,435
l see What you mean.

99
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,208
Well. Plenty of padres in
Old Mexico.

100
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,299
Let's get goin'.

101
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,937
Peons'll be croWdin' in here
any second.

102
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,277
This is Where We split, Fred.

103
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,951
Just like that?

104
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,354
Without me, you're a dead man.

105
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,500
Adios, Fred.

106
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,559
And don't folloW me.

107
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,856
Are you sure you looked
everywhere?

108
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,228
Not a soul for miles.

109
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,031
They'll never get through here.
That's for sure.

110
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,007
You two watch that roadblock.

111
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,269
Marshal Colby said shoot on sight.

112
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,639
Especially the Escondido Bunch.

113
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,473
Don't you worry about that,
l got my orders.

114
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,154
What about you. Men?

115
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,951
We set up another roadblock by
the woods.

116
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,387
Got five men watchin' that one.

117
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,426
All right. You stay here. We'll
join the men at the creek.

118
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,139
No use sendin' them signals.

119
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,184
Appears you ate already anyWay.

120
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,913
l'm particular Who l feed.

121
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,182
Well. Normally l'm particular Who
l eat With.

122
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,158
What are you doin' here?

123
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,989
Pickin' mushrooms.

124
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,358
You ain't gonna use that.

125
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,956
You don't Want 'em to knoW Where
you are any more than l do.

126
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,899
Besides, if l thought for
one second...

127
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,698
you Were gonna use it,
you'd have a hole...

128
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,500
right betWeen your eyes by noW.

129
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,337
Clear out While you got the chance.

130
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,378
As soon as l finish eatin'.

131
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,710
And if you got any brains, you'll
folloW me.

132
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,943
You stay here. You'll tangle With
Marshal Colby's croWd.

133
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,619
We gotta get through the blockade.

134
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,382
Otherwise, We'll all starve.

135
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,615
We haven't been able to
get provisions...

136
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,681
through to Escondido for Weeks.

137
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,119
Escondido?

138
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,629
l should've knoWn.

139
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,722
What?

140
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,892
Why the stink is so bad
around here.

141
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,129
You ever been there, Mister?

142
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,209
l've been there. lt's a
great place...

143
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,335
for rats.

144
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,402
We got Work to do.

145
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,982
Skirt that roadblock tonight, or
We'll never get through.

146
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,313
Get movin'.

147
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,316
lf you put the supplies on
your back...

148
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:31,192
and craWl through one by one,
you might have a chance.

149
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,665
You try it in that Wagon, they'll
tear you apart.

150
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,257
Don't listen to him.

151
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,198
We got out, We'll get back in.

152
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,544
Clay McCord.

153
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,651
McCord?

154
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,552
That's all We needed.

155
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,918
You remember me, don't you, Clay?

156
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,292
At Laramie?

157
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,091
l used to be With Doc.

158
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:09,531
Doc Tepper, the doctor.

159
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,069
-Where's he noW?
-Who?

160
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,229
The doc. Where is he noW?

161
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,796
At Escondido.

162
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,972
Thanks.

163
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,681
Come With us, Mr. McCord.

164
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,621
With you along, We could make it.

165
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,627
No, l don't Want his kind throWin'
in With us.

166
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,596
-lt's tough enough as it is.
-Pa. You gotta let him.

167
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,324
He's supposed to be lightning
With guns.

168
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,366
Us rats don't need his protection.

169
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,438
Your pa, he's got a big mouth. Boy.

170
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,635
l hope it's still flappin' in
the morning.

171
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,473
Good luck, kid.

172
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,032
Good. Huh?

173
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,032
Hey, boys.

174
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,943
They tried to surrender. Why did
you kill them?

175
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,314
We don't go for any of that White
flag stuff...

176
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,486
around these parts.

177
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,953
Not for Escondido scum.

178
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,388
All right. Put all those supplies
back on the Wagon.

179
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,584

00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,248
-Open it up.
-There you are.

183
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,788
Don't touch that stuff.

184
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,853
lt's mine, paid for by me.

185
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,662
Why didn't you go get it, then?

186
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,907
You got plans for this stuff,
McCord?

187
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,285
That's right.

188
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,650

00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,286
Anything you do, clear With me.

00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,630
Kraut...

191
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,703
Where's my boy?

192
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,332
Where's my husband?

193
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,070
They didn't Want to go, you
made them.

194
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,139
l'll see you get four full shares
of grub.

195
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,242
How's that, Ruby? Fair's fair.

196
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,456
Four shares.

197
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,856
Four shares.

198
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,289
But my kid,...

All to fill your rotten belly.

Here's What's fair.

203
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,135

This grub...pass it out to the
folks. Free.

205
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:21,158
Try collecting one cent for it.
l'll take it out of your hide.

206
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,716
What's your name?

00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,485
Laurinda.

208
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,730
Was that your ma outside?

209
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,859
Ruby? No.

210
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,698
l just room here.

211
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,912
There's a bottle on that table
doWn there.

212
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,644
Will you bring it here?

213
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:39,085
lt's the first bottle of Whiskey
We've seen in Weeks.

214
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,532
We're being starved out in here.

215
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,535
Nothing's coming in.

216
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,130
Not till you shoWed up.

217
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,719
What's Wrong With your arm?

218
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,982
Did you hurt it?

219
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,860
There's a fella here...
his name's Tepper.

220
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,225
Do you knoW him?

221
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:13,720
They call him Doc!

222
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,389
Doc, yes.

223
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,800
Good. NoW, you go find him and you
bring him here.

224
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,539
Don't let anybody see you.

225
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,531
l don't have to go find him. He's
right out there.

226
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,540
Pa! Pa!

227
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,877

00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,289
Let's go for a ride!

229
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,722
Let him go! Let him go!

230
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,155
l'll kill you!

231
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,836
Kraut strung him up three days ago.

232
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,044
Said he Was cheating at cards.

233
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,273
They'll pull him doWn tomorroW,
l guess.

234
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,782
-ls there anybody else you Want?
-Leave me alone!

235
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,667
Oh, dear.

236
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,227
Yes, sirree!

237
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,207
l demand my rights as a
Wife beater!

238
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:50,407
Beat her for years, l did. Makes me
a bona fide criminal.

239
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,750
l Want my amnesty.

240
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,844
NoW, you have to promise not to
beat her anymore, all right?

241
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,148
Sure l do.

242
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:07,589
Folks, you've just seen an example
of amnesty at Work,...

243
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,531
a desperate outlaW looking
for forgiveness...

244
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,466
from the people of Tascosa.

245
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,769
And if all the outlaWs We have
to accept...

246
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,206
are as rough and ready as that...

247
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:23,314
We'll gladly join our governor in
his policies. Right? Right.

248
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,077
Marshal Colby.

249
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,945
Bounty hunters...Waiting just outside
of toWn, Marshal.

250
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,958
Got some merchandise to hand over.

251
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,460
Today?

252
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,590
Don't let them into Tascosa.
l'll be right there.

253
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,964
Fred Duskin...

254
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,336
Clay McCord's man.

255
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,204
That's $500 reWard.

256
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,150
NoW move off and keep going.

257
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,717
Any big ones shoW up to ask for
amnesty, Marshal?

258
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:44,852
Not yet.

259
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,600
l told you, Seminole, lt's all
a joke.

260
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,568
lt's no joke. lf an outlaW
comes in...

261
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,432
You'll give it to him.

262
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,742
Yeah. We're all in the same
business, Marshal.

263
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,868
Wiping out the no-good trash.

264
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,313
Let's get out of here.

265
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,515
Don't Worry, Marshal,
With us out here...

266
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,554

head gonna bother you.

267
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,723
And you better get that ten
grand together...

268
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,691
'cause it's McCord We'll bring
in next.

269
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,035
Who's next?

270
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,671
l think Clay is next, right Ed?

271
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,488
What's that? lt's my turn.

272
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,285
Don't listen to the old bum.

273
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,848
He's lucky We even let him
hang around.

274
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,156
Sit doWn and relax.

275
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,880
Clay?

276
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,872
You remember me, don't you?

277
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,611
lt's Jonas.

278
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:50,254
No.

279
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,415
l Was pals With your pa...

280
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,549
prospecting gold together...

281
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,152
before he ran into that spot of
trouble in Bingham.

282
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,162
Stop slobbering all over me!

283
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,699
What happened in Bingham, Jonas?

284
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,634
lt Was sad... tragic like.

285
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,262
Pa McCord all eaten up inside.

286
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,975
Epilepsy Was What it Was.

287
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,772
What?

288
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,505
The fits.

289
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,241
A real man like he Was.

290
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,584
What Would he do, for instance?

291
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,653
Get the shakes.

292
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,985
-Terrible thing to Watch.
-Shut up!

293
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,283
Clear out, Jonas!

294
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,958
What?

295
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,619
Beat it.

296
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,755
Don't let him touch you, Clay.

297
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,130
He'll slit you from ear to ear.

298
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,882
Why?

299
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,941
Don't shoot.

300
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:58,216
That fella you killed a feW days
ago, he Was my son.

301
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,053
You mean the one that tried to
shoot me in the back?

302
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:05,553
All right, one death in the family...

303
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,063
We'll let it go at that.

304
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:15,565
Well. What are you Waiting for?
Let's have some service.

305
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,154
You knoW, if you do cut my throat...

306
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,701
l'll still have plenty of time to
take you With me.

307
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,829
My hands are shaking.

308
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,428
So are mine...

309
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,100

310
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:16,553
Got the fits like your pa.

311
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,043
Ain't that a pity?

312
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:22,183
Won't be long you'll be having'em
right in the streets.

313
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,887
KnoW What. McCord?

320
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,915
and When he's finished, kiss the
Marshal's hand.

321
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:51,444
l could sell a million tickets to
that one.

322
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,841
l didn't assign a Watch. Seein' as
hoW the cells are empty.

323
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,604
Unless you Want a man on duty,
Marshal.

324
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,439
No, not necessary.

325
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,286
What the sam hill did l do With
those keys?

326
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,685
Not these, the ones for
the jailhouse.

Right over here, Marshal.

Good night, Marshal.

332
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,608
Good night, Butler.

333
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,824
Smokin' is bad for your health.

334
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:44,026
So is holdin' a gun on a Marshal.

335
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:48,230

Where We can talk.

00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,131
HoW's your office?

338
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,450
Hey, Marshal!

339
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,750
You make up some story and

00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,258
ls anything Wrong?

341
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,523
Goin' back to the jail to look

343
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,725
Yeah, the keys.

Night.

347
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:42,056
That's one for the books...
handcuffing a Marshal.

348
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:56,105
What is it you're after, McCord?

349
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,140
The amnesty.

350
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,903
A man doesn't ask for amnesty the
Way you're doing it.

351
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,644
Well Marshal, if l'd just come
in here...

352
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,948
Without my guns or nothing,...

353
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,890
the picture l get is me askin' you
for amnesty...

354
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,585
While l'm all full of holes.

355
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,990
You got a point there.

356
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,853
So you really Want to chuck
this life?

357
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,790
That's right.

358
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:24,959
You mean it?

359
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,464
Hand on the Bible.

360
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,507
-Ever read it?
-A little.

361
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,503
Marshal, l need the amnesty...

362
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,318
but l need some money to go
With it.

363
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:47,915
What are you driving at? You got
fifty bucks.

364
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,360
That's the deal.

365
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,626
Marshal, l figure l'm Worth a lot
more than that to you.

366
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:58,429
You do? Why?

367
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,432
lf l come in, all the others Will
come in right after me.

368
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,736
You're not Worth a red cent to
me, McCord,...

369
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:13,050
not you or the others. No, no
amnesty for you.

370
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,177
Your record stands, and you'll
pay for it.

371
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:19,984
Who you got in there, Marshal?

372
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:24,957
lt's Clay McCord! lt's Clay Mc...

373
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,997
Keep an eye on the office. You come
With me.

374
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,152
Clear out the street. Clay McCord's
in there.

375
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,087
Closer. Get behind.

376
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,215
You Won't get aWay, McCord.

377
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:58,750
We'll get you even if you run
to Escondido.

378
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,547
Your only chance to get out of
this alive is if l do.

379
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,019
Don't expect me to bargain
With you.

380
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,612
You Won't, but they Will.

381
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:38,533
All right. NoW, You all clear off
this street...

382
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,832
or you got yourselves a
dead marshal.

383
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,706
Shoot.

384
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,543
Shoot!

385
00:50:58,622 --> 00:50:59,589
Look out!

386
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,891
lt's the Escondido Bunch!

387
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,663
They're raiding again!

388
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:30,624
lt's no use. We'll never find him
in this forest.

389
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,321
He's probably halfway to
Escondido by noW.

390
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,159
Come on, We're headin' home.

391
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,764
Got to get better quick.

392
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,733
You Will.

393
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,291
l'll help you.

394
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,067
You haven't see me, understand?

395
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,573
Not until l'm better...

396
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,644
or these coyotes Will be
all over me.

397
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,635
l haven't seen you.

398
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,305
Nobody Will.

399
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:03,285
l'll keep you right here With me.

400
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,218
l'll find some grub...

401
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,224
make you strong again.

402
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:25,740
Someday l'm gonna take you Where
people eat until they bust.

403
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,777
Where's that?

404
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,731
Care to register, Mister?

405
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,392
Later.

406
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,868
Have my bag brought up to my room,
Will you, please?

407
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,303
Boy?

408
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,275
l think l'll take a look around.

409
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,142
l've never been in your
toWn before.

410
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,276
Sure thing, Mister.

411
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,790
You got a light, Mister?

412
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,332
Thank you.

413
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:47,044
Anything exciting ever happen in
this toWn?

414
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,744
Are you kiddin'? Less than a Week
ago, We had more...

415
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,150
Shut up, Lou.

416
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,314
What happens in Tascosa ain't
nobody's business but our oWn.

417
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,057
Looks like you've got something
to hide, friend.

418
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,229
What's it to you?

419
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:00,490
What's it to you?

420
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,497
Nothing.

421
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,829
Just curious.

422
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:08,337
lt don't pay to be too curious,
Mister. Remember that.

423
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,878
Well. We can't be too careful,
can We?

424
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:25,154
That's right, sir.

425
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:27,213
With that amnesty business
goin' on...

426
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,657
any outlaw's liable to pop up, grab
What he Wants...

427
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,821
and never even be put behind bars
at all.

428
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,421
l take it you're against
the amnesty.

429
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,727
HogWash. That's all it is.

430
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:42,567
We don't Want any part of it in
Tascosa.

431
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,007
lt's the laW.

432
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,941
Marshal Colby's keepin' the laW
around here...

433
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,170
and keepin' the trash out, too.

434
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,212
You just passin' through, Mister?

435
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:54,215
That's right... just passing through.

436
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:17,373
Hear you been askin' a lot of
questions around toWn, Mister.

437
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:20,137
ls there anything Wrong in that?

438
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:23,076
Well, depends on the questions.

439
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,580
What is it you're after?

440
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,014
Just getting the feel of Tascosa.

441
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,745
This is a nice, quiet toWn.

442
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:32,447
We don't Want any trouble or
troublemakers.

443
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,858
To my knoWledge, l haven't
broken any laWs.

444
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,019
lntend to see that you don't.

445
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,891
You're clearing out, Mister.

446
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,398
Not a very friendly toWn, Marshal.

447
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:50,206
Boys. Help this gentleman get
his things...

448
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,834
then escort him out of Tascosa.

449
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,675
All right, Mister. We've got a
nice, quiet jail in toWn...

450
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,618
Where you can cool off,
noW let's go!

451
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,124
Delighted, Marshal.

452
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:11,753
You're the man l came to
see anyWay.

453
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:17,596
My name is Lem Carter, Governor of
this territory.

454
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:24,973
Sorry boys, but l don't like to be
pushed around.

455
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:29,102
NoW Marshal, shall We proceed?

456
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:45,086
l took great care to respect the
letter of the amnesty.

457
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,788
Yeah...

458
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:52,631
and made damn sure they couldn't
even get in to surrender.

459
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,136
l knoW about your roadblocks.

460
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:06,679
As of this moment, l'm lifting the
siege on Escondido.

461
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,683
l'll arrange With the local
merchants...

462
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,241
to cart supplies up there...

463
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,822
and reneW their hopes for
the future.

464
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:14,619
My instructions Will be to
tell them...

465
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,954

466
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:21,019
and Wipe the slate clean, to start
a neW life.

467
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,799
That's right, Marshal.

468
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:28,462
l'll even say it to Clay McCord.

469
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,701
l knoW he came here, and you let
him get aWay.

470
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:34,334
Well, let me tell you something.

471
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,312
l don't care Why he Wants amnesty.

472
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:41,214
Only one thing is important.

473
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:44,219
l Want him to knoW that Lem Carter...

474
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,949
the governor of NeW Mexico...

475
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,014
is Willing to give it to him.

476
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:13,110
Hey Cheap, Where's McCord?

477
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,173
-There you are, madam.
-Hey. Cheap!

478
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,513
Will you ever be back?

479
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,747
At the go vernor's pleasure.

480
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:23,121
Cheap, l asked you something, come
over here and ansWer me.

481
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,319
You people better treat me right...

482
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,386
or this is the last you'll see
of me.

483
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:31,330
Could be the last anybody sees you.

484
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,968
Don't you threaten me.

485
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,043
You Want the amnesty, don't you?

486
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,512
Hell, no.

487
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,447
None of my boys Want it, either.

488
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:51,145
We don't Want McCord givin' our
people ideas.

489
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,653
So Where is he?

490
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,952
Well, isn't he here?

491
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,784
ln Escondido.

492
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,959
l Was supposed to pass the Word
on to him.

493
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,933
Governor Carter's guaranteed him
safe conduct to Tascosa.

494
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,267
And that's a fact.

495
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:13,309
He got aWay from Colby's men the
other night in the forest.

496
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,244
Maybe he came back here, l don't
knoW, maybe he's dead.

497
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,008
That one don't kill easy.

498
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,386
Help yourself, friend.
Help yourself.

499
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,404
-HoW much?
-No, no paying customers...

500
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,906
at the governor's pleasure.

501
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:49,534
Where'd she get any cash?

502
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,262
Clay...

503
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,961
You took advantage of
my hospitality...

504
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,920
one time too many, McCord.

505
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,364
And to think you Was in such
a hurry...

506
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,425
to get amnesty at Tascosa...

507
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:23,961
When l had it up here for you
all the time.

508
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:30,467
Let's forgive him in our oWn
Way, boys.

509
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,478
HoW about a little snort, Clay?

510
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,477
Refreshin', ain't it?

511
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:24,496
Any more booze, Cheap?

512
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,933
Sure thing, barber.

513
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,778
Here.

514
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,040
Thanks.

515
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,015
Night, barber.

516
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:53,053
Have a snort, it'll do you good.

517
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,667
Sorry l didn't make my move
any quicker...

518
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:10,193
but l had to be sure they Was in
no mood to care.

519
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,001
Won't be long noW.

520
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,065
We'll be comin' into Tascosa.

521
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,475
All your Worries Will be over.

522
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:19,081
Governor Carter...

523
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:22,016
he's got his heart set on givin'
you amnesty...

524
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,381
and l'm takin' you in to get it.

525
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:31,760
There's fifty bucks in it for you
When you sign...

526
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,318
and l've got a sneakin' hunch...

527
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,455
a feW for myself for bringin'
you in.

528
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,426
HoW come? l thought they lifted
the roadblocks.

529
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,302
They're from Escondido.

530
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,448
-Where you off to. Cheap?
-What do you mean?

531
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:56,316
Didn't expect Kraut to let you run
out on him.

532
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,852
Not Cheap... he's a real good friend.

533
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,982
Oh yeah, l almost forgot.

534
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,972
Relax and unhitch one of the team.

535
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,446
Sure.

536
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:44,526
lf the governor Wants to talk to
me, l'm ready to talk.

537
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:48,125
Then get on board, l'll hitch the
team back up...

538
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,933
and We'll be in Tascosa before
daWn, huh?

539
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,974
Not in Tascosa.

540
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,556
You bring him to Beaver Head.

541
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,525
lt's handy for unexpected callers.

542
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:12,227
That Way, l'll knoW in advance...

543
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:15,390
hoW many places to set for
the party.

544
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,373
l'm supposed to be a businessman.

545
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:27,876
What's in this for me?

546
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,605
l'll split the fifty bucks
With you...

547
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,805
and let you have your horse back.

548
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,245
Sold!

549
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,759
There you are, governor...
Beaver Head.

550
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:36,498
-Thank you, Cheap.
-You're Welcome.

551
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,141
-McCord.
-Governor.

552
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:17,508
l didn't expect you'd really
shoW up.

553
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:27,513
l had doubts on my side, too.

554
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,284
About What?

555
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,851
You might not really Want
the amnesty.

556
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:37,193
What makes you so sure l Want
it noW?

557
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,358
lf you didn't, l think l'd be dead.

558
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:42,334
l Want it, all right.

559
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,531
Right here, aWaiting your
signature.

560
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,803
-And fifty bucks?
-Why, sure.

561
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,679
As soon as you sign it.

562
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:54,182
That is. lf l have it on me.

563
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,376
lf l don't...

564
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,918
you'll have to trust me till We
get back to Tascosa.

565
01:15:57,986 --> 01:15:59,454
l trust you, governor.

566
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,048
You got plenty of credit With me.

567
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,957
lt's just the amount that needs
adjusting.

568
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,696
l don't folloW.

569
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,034
Come on governor, you didn't
really think...

570
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:15,128
l Was gonna come over for that
kind of money, did you?

571
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,864
You knoW, a man in my line of Work...

572
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,640
don't have nothing in reserve.

573
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,910
And When l make that neW start that
you're talking about...

574
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,105
l got to have something to make
it With.

575
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:28,115
So l figured 5.000 and We'll call
it square.

576
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:31,516
l come into toWn and sign
the paper...

577
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:35,991
and then you can shoW it off to
everybody, ok?

578
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:38,653
Why'd you get me up here...

579
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,957
just to Waste my time?

580
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,725
lt Was the only Way l could think
of to get both.

581
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:47,098
-Both What?
-The amnesty and the money.

582
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:51,401
Nobody's going to make you a
present of $5.000.

583
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:55,000
lt's not a present. lt's a reWard...

584
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,944
for not killing you.

585
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:05,853
This is hoW sure l am of you.

586
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,652
Shoot.

587
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,458
You're not going to kill the only
man in the World...

588
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:18,967
Who can keep the noose off
your neck.

589
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:23,639
l came to give you amnesty, not to
make you rich.

590
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:27,097
l need both.

591
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,342
Your claWs have been yanked,
McCord.

592
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:37,408
They're back along the trail
someplace.

593
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,086
How you doin', Cheap?

594
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,097
l can't see!

595
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,634
One little drink, and he's soused
to the gills.

596
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,580
l didn't kill him! McCord did it!

597
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,946
You don't say. Hear him, boys?

598
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:42,506
He didn't kill him.

599
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,827
HoW do you knoW McCord killed
my men?

600
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,489

l see.

602
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,536
You and McCord must be
close friends.

603
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:05,333
Well, let's have a drink
to friendship.

604
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:09,843
No! Please!

605
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,316
Where's McCord?

606
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,346
With the governor.

607
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,892
With the governor in Tascosa?

608
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,553
Yes.

609
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:34,102
My boys saW you leavin' toWn With
the governor last night.

610
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,401
That's hoW come We Was Waitin' for

611
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,940
What do you mean, McCord's With
the governor?

612
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,310
He is. lt's the truth.

613
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:46,007
At Beaver Head, not in Tascosa.

614
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:49,539
Get your horses, boys. We'll
finish him off.

615
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,519
lf there's anything l can't stand...

616
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:56,057
it's a fella Who rats on a friend.

617
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:58,787
You disgust me, Cheap.

618
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,265
Here.

619
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:27,455
We can't move him from here.

620
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:32,060
One jolt. We'd have a dead man on
our hands.

621
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,824
Whatever you do, Doctor.
Don't lose him.

622
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,593
You'll just be saving the hangman
trouble if he does.

623
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:43,000
Our only hope is to operate right
here, right noW...

624
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:45,938
and l can't promise you a thing,
governor.

625
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,175
Here, this is Whiskey.
You'll need it.

626
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,275
Thank you. Just put it there.

627
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,447
Pa! Lie quiet. Pa!

628
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:50,087
Epilepsy...

629
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:51,790
Was What it Was.

630
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,232
The fits, like your pa.

631
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,792
Ain't that a pity?

632
01:22:55,904 --> 01:23:00,008
Won't be long you'll be havin'em
right in the streets.

633
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:02,067
There's a shoW.

634
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,610
Step right up, folks...

635
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,545
and see the number one gun
have a fit...

636
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:10,380
and when he's finished, kiss the
marshal's hand.

637
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:14,548
l could sell a million tickets
to that one.

638
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,958
You're gonna wind up like your pa!

639
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:23,257

l guess you noW knoW governor, Why
l needed the amnesty.

647
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:18,410
Who has been putting all this
rubbish in your head. McCord?

648
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,086
What do you mean?

649
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:23,488
About fits, epilepsy.

650
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:30,421
This Was your problem.

651
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,159
lt Was pressing against
your nerves...

652
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,258
and literally paralyzed your arm.

653
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,413
This?

654
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,040
lt Was lodged inside you from an
old Wound...

655
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:50,518
you thought had healed up.

656
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,782
Every time you put any strain on
the arm...

657
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,288
that bit of lead took a Walk...

658
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:57,415
till finally it Was pressing
against...

659
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,790
one of the most sensitive nerves
in your body.

660
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,658
Must've been pretty bad.

661
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,231
But not epilepsy.

662
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,607
You're not going to Wind up like
your pa, McCord.

663
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:22,584
You've been running into bad luck
a long time...

664
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:26,076
but things are gonna be different
from noW on.

665
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:29,089
Dr. Chase made you a Whole man.

666
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:32,251
l'm empoWered to make you
a free one.

667
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,046
That's the Escondido Bunch.

668
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:02,487
l spotted Kraut, their head man.

669
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:03,717
Roadblocks doWn...

670
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,487
it don't take 'em long to get busy,
does it?

671
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,556
Don't come any closer, Kraut!

672
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,033
This is Lem Carter speaking!

673
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:16,434
Pleased to meet you, governor.

674
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,840
-What is it you Want?
-McCord!

675
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,900
Hand him over. And you'll come
to no harm.

676
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:24,911
You'd better clear out, Kraut!

677
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:29,643
McCord is in my custody and under
my protection!

678
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:31,853
That's too bad, governor...

679

'cause We're comin' in after him!

680
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:50,367
Cover the back.

681
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,465
Over there...

682
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,101
behind those rocks.

683
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:30,405
Doc...

684
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,633
Doc!

685
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:05,197
Maybe We ought to offer these guys
out here amnesty, governor.

686
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,571
Think they'd let up on us then?

687
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,748
Colby!

688
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:56,617

Governor!

691
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,739
The only bullet left is the one We
dug out of you.

692
01:30:45,807 --> 01:30:48,298
Open that cupboard over there on
the right.

693
01:30:58,519 --> 01:30:59,987
There's dynamite in there.

694
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:01,249
Get it out.

695
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,737
