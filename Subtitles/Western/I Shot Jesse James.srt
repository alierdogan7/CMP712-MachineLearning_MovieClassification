- Yeah. Act of pardon.

Meanin' I'm afraid of Frank?

170
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,747
Ain't ya?

171
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,749
Sure.

172
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,252
If I want to think I'm afraid
or say I'm afraid...

173
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,255
I'll think it and I'll say it.

174
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,056
Nothing gonna stop me
from marryin' Cynthy.

175
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,665
Nothin'.

176
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,309
Hey, Bob.

177
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,575
Bob.

178
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,649
Hey, hurry up, Bob.

179
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,934
That's wonderful.

180
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,702
That's more like it.
It's nice and warm now.

181
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,047
Be back in a minute.

182
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,310

- Yeah?

183
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,386

188
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,897
Sure. When I give a present,
I like to make it complete.

189
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,789
Well, go ahead, Bob.
What are you waitin' for?

190
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,790
There's my back.

191
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,820

<i>Hey, Bob.</i>

I'll see you in the mornin'.

194
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,123
What are you doin'
pokin' around out there, Bob?

195
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,164
Come on in. Let's talk.
It's kind of lonesome without Frank around.

196
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,311
It ain't lawful. Even folks in town what
don't likeJesseJames is sayin' it ain't lawful.

197
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,312
Don't you fret about it, Zee.

198
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,851
It's just as if the governor was advertisin'
to hire an assassin to go and kill you unawares.

199
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,045
I ain't killed yet, Zee.

200
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,259
I pick my friends, and I know 'em.

201
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,161
No friend of mine would swallow
that immunity offered by the governor.

202
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,867
Ain't that -

203
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,537
What are you so nervous for?

204
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,664
Did Cynthy turn you down?

205
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,776
Yeah. Kind - Kinda.

206
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,472
Think I'll go in to St. Joe
and buy a new horse.

207
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,983
You can fetch the children
home from school with ya.

208
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,383
Yeah. I'll do that, Zee.

209
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,794
I'm tired.

210
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,797
<i>I guess maybe Zee's right.</i>

211
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,096
<i>Time I settled down.</i>

212
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,239
That's what you ought to do, Bob -

213
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,138
<i>get yourself a wife and a home.</i>

214
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,177
That's what I'm aimin' to do, Jess.

216
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,476
It's only 11:00.

217
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,784
Think I'll wait until later
this afternoon and go in town.

218
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,290
[Sighs]
It's an awful hot day.

219
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,822
Feel kind of naked without my weapons.

220
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:59,743
No, sir.
Nothin' like putterin' around a home.

221
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,499
There's no 10,000.

222
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,298
The governor didn't conspire with you
to assassinateJesse.

223
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,000
The reward was $5,000
for his apprehension.

224
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,076
Five for conviction.

225
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,218
All you get is 500.

<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

227
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,270
Bob, you ought to see the way folks
look at me when I walk down the street.

228
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,362
You ought to see 'em, Bob.

229
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,964
- That $10,000?
- 500.

230
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,045
- What happened to the rest of it?
- What's the difference?

231
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,979
I got enough to buy Cynthy a ring -
a diamond ring. A great big one.

232
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,417
- You can be best man.
- Oh, not me.

233
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,217
I'm not hanging around waiting
for a ball from FrankJames's gun...

234
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,224
or buckshot from some of the folks
what don't like what happened toJess.

235
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,726
- Scared?
- He'll get you, Bob.

236
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,560
He'll get both of us.
I'm ridin' out.

237
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,634
Stake me, Bob?

238
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,138
- Here's a hundred.
- Thanks, Bob.

239
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,208

I, uh, was talking to the manager,
Mr. Kane.

He told me you changed your mind.
You're not going to leave the show.

- What's the matter?
- How could you have done it?

256
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,148
Jesse, your best friend.
How, Bob? How?

257
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:09,056
- I didn't do it for the reward.
- I know, I know, I know!

258
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,159
Then why are you looking at me
like I'm poison?

259
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,164
Can't you understand what's happened?

260
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,565
You got me kind of all mixed up.

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,104

all the love I had for you -

262
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,800
- But I done it for you.
- Don't say that! Don't ever say that!

263
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,672
- But it's true, Cynthy.
- Can't you see how wrong it was?

264
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,973
- It was legal.
- It was murder.

265
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,776
Don't look at it that way.

266
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,851
You ought to be proud of me.

267
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,082
The governor's grateful. The law says it's legal.
Don't look at it no other way.

268
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,589
What other way can I look at it?

00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,589
I ain't on the run no more.

271
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:50,259
I can walk down the street, and nobody-
not even the whole militia - can bother me.

272
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,996
That's what the shooting means to you?

273
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:59,202
What it means to me -
It means I'm a free man.

274
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,278

Listen, Cynthy.
When I killed Jess, I had a cause.

285
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,115
If you turn against me, I got no reason.

286
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,454
The way you did it, Bob -
Oh, can't you understand?

287
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,528
The love I had for you was -

288
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,432
No, it ain't that.

289
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,066
Something else has turned you from me.

290
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,574
I ain't a murderer.

291
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,271
So there's gotta be a reason.

292
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,780

293
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,783

What was he doin' here when I came in?

295
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,579
Did you see him much
when I was in jail?

296
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,557
- Stop it!
- I knew there had to be a reason.

297
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,627
I knew.

- Or, uh, his?
- Oh, please, Mr. Kelley.

312
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,923
Just a minute, Miss Waters.
We, uh, hardly know each other. Up to now -

- There's no time to -
- You're not giving me any chance to get to know ya.

You barge in here
and tell me I have to run away...

315
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:37,600
just because that hotheaded Ford
says we're lovers.

316
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,330
- Don't make sense.
- His guns do.

317
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,429
Yeah. That does give him quite an edge.

318
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,531
- He's dangerous.
- Why?

319
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,440
Because he killed his best friend?

320
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,449
Look, I'm telling you to go
because I don't want any more bloodshed.

321
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:58,147
- He's jealous and -
- Was, uh, JesseJames in love with you too?

322
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,986
- It was for the amnesty.
- And not the reward.

323
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,560
- He wanted to be free to marry me.
- Look. We're wasting time.

324
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,095
He's on his way up here now
looking for you.

325
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,597
I don't think he'll shoot
unless I turn my back.

326
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,895
He killed JesseJames because of me.

327
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,132
<i>He didn't want money.</i>
<i>He wanted me.</i>

328
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,768

And now he thinks we're lovers.

329
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,609
Oh, don't you see, Mr. Kelley?
I don't want any more murders because of me.

833
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,447
Turn around, Kelley!

834
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,525
Turn around!

835
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,571
I ain't waitin', Kelley!
Turn around!

836
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:44,141
Kelley! Turn around!

837
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:46,146
Go on. Shoot.

838
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,648
I ain't waitin', Kelley!
Turn around!

839
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:54,244
- Keep away from your gun and listen.
- I'm listenin'.

840
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:57,154
I was hopin' I could talk some sense
into you without the help of-

841
01:19:57,259 --> 01:20:01,389
- I'm still listenin'.
- She's not gonna marry you.

842
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:03,930
<i>She came here to tell you that.</i>

843
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:06,557
We both love her-
you in your way...

844
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:10,297
and me - me in my way.

845
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,733
Some men will kill for a woman.

846
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:16,242
<i>Some won't.</i>

847
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,904
You won't
'cause you don't love her enough.

848
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,201
He just wouldn't listen to me.

849
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:48,808
- Aw, Cynthy.
- Shh.

850
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:57,946
I - I want to tell you somethin'
I ain't never told anyone.

851
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,953
Oh, Bob.

852
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:04,481
I'm sorry for what I done toJess.

853
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:09,597
I loved him.
