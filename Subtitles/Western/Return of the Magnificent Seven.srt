00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:25,357
Hide.

3
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:50,047
What did he mean, "hide"?

4
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:56,261
- It must have been the sun.
- The sun didn't tie his hands.

5
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,849
Chico!

6
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,374
No, Chico. No.

7
00:05:56,669 --> 00:05:58,713
No.

8
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,231
Drive them into the square.

9
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,741
Ole!

10
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:57,286
Ole! Ole!

11
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,936
Ole! Ole!

12
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,031
- Hello, Chris.
- Vin.

13
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:21,867
Thought you took a job
ridin' shotgun for Overland.

14
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:24,786
- I quit.
- How come?

15
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:27,873
My health.

16
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:31,501
Doctor said to find a climate
with less lead in the air.

17
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:34,170
What are you doing here?

18
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:37,507
Tracked a man across the line for bounty.

19
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,384
- Who?
- Ole!

20
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,347
You.

21
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,438
Well, ain't you gonna ask?

22
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:54,940
- What?
- Why I'm after ya.

23
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,734
You just told me. Bounty.

24
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:01,363
Hell, Chris, you think
I'd do a thing like that?

25
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:04,241
I came so you'd know
there was a price on your head.

26
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,576
How much?

27
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:08,787
- Five hundred.
- Dollars?

28
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,708
Pesos.

29
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:20,090
Hell, it's enough some shypoke might
throw down on you while you're asleep.

30
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,883
Maybe I oughta ride with ya,
in case you need any help.

31
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,721
- Wouldn't want to put you to any trouble.
- No trouble.

32
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,308
No trouble at all.

33
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,190
Bravo!

34
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,557
Hell,...

35
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,934
.. let him fight.

36
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,396
- I'll pay for the bull.
- ? Ypagaras el entierro?

37
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:22,025
He wants to know
if you'll pay for the funeraI, too.

38
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:55,598
Ole!

39
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:57,767
Ole!

40
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,355
Aha! Aha!

41
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:14,858
Friend of yours?

42
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,826
Petra.

43
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:15,874
- I prayed you'd be here.
- What is it, Petra? What happened?

44
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:20,754
Two days ago, many men with guns
rode into our village.

45
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,716
Chico tried to fight them. It was no use.

46
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,470
All the men they did not kill,
they drove into the square...

47
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,098
.. and took them off into the desert.

48
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,767
Coming here,
we passed through two villages,...

49
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,729
.. both of them empty of men.

50
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,607
Only women, crying over their dead.

51
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,359
You say many men with guns.

52
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,154
- How many?
- I don't know. Fifty, maybe more.

53
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,867
They didn't say anything?
Where they were taking them? Why?

54
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,620
- Nothing.
- What do you make of it, Chris?

55
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,833
- I don't know.
- We can't fight a whole army of 'em.

56
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,168
Chico would, if it was
the other way round.

57
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,337
Chico's a fooI.

58
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,589
Because he laid his gun aside,...

59
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,884
.. married Petra,
tried to amount to something?

60
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,971
? Vamos esta noche, senor, o manana?

61
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,724
What did he say?

62
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:20,479
He wants to know if we are going
after them tonight, or in the morning.

63
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,235
It's a big country.
Findin' 'em could take a long time.

64
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,906
Hell, I haven't been
going anywhere for ten years.

65
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:34,575
Either have you.

66
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,370
Ain't it the truth.

67
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,788
Take them to my room.
They can sleep there.

68
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:42,124
- Where are you headin'?
- To get help.

69
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:46,420
- Findin' men ain't gonna be easy.
- Depends where you look.

70
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:19,535
- What about this one?
- He stole a pig, senor.

71
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:23,164
- A pig?
- Yes.

72
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:25,750
I can let you have him very cheap.

73
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:37,761
- This one?
- He caught his wife with another man.

74
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,931
Both of them.

75
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:51,107
This one is worth many pesos, senor.

76
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:54,236
- But if I were you...
- Open it.

77
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,905
- Senor...
- Open.

78
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,303
Hello, Frank.

79
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:23,471
Chris.

80
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:27,601
- Haven't seen you around.
- Haven't been around. Been in here.

81
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:31,062
He killed four men in a gunfight.

82
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,652
- That's a fact.
- How would you like to get out?

83
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:40,530
- I'm listenin'.
- Friend of mine's in trouble.

84
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,407
- How much trouble?
- About as much as you are.

85
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:48,287
- How many guns you up against?
- Fifty... Maybe more.

86
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:51,374
Anybody on your side?

87
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,050
How much?

88
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:04,720
The risk is very great, senor.

89
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,972
A hundred pesos?

90
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:09,849
- Fifty.
- He killed four men.

91
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:17,608
I could make it five.

92
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,943
Fifty.

93
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,698
- Where'II I find you?
- At the hoteI.

94
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:29,160
We're riding south in the morning.
You got a horse?

95
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:32,163
No... I'll get one.

96
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:43,049
He is not very friendly.

97
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:45,551
I'm not hiring friends.

98
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,970
Are you going to talk all night?

99
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,931
If you had any respect
for a condemned man,...

100
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,518
.. you'd keep quiet and
let him spend his last hours in peace.

101
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:57,771
- He is going to be shot in the morning.
- What'd he do?

102
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,523
Huh! What didn't he do?

103
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:03,109
That is Luis Emilio Delgado.

104
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:16,790
I take it you did not understand me, senor.

105
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,458
You are Luis Delgado.

106
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,669
- You know me?
- Heard of you.

107
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:27,550
Did I not tell you I was famous?

108
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:31,053
That is his last request.

109
00:20:33,055 --> 00:20:36,224
You don't know how good
that makes a man feeI.

110
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,187
- I can imagine.
- I mean you knowing my name,...

111
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:41,939
.. who I am.

112
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:45,650
For years I have said to myself
"Luis, the day will come...

113
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:48,862
.. when you'll not have to
ride in the dust of others,...

114
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:51,281
.. when everyone will know who you are. "

115
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:55,493
"There'll not be a train or a village
robbed that people will not say...

116
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:59,956
.. 'The one who robbed from us
was el bandido Luis Emilio Delgado. "'

117
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:06,295
And just when I was about to
amount to something, this had to happen.

118
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:11,133
What will people think of me when they
find out I was shot for killing one man?

119
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:13,760
One stinking little man.

120
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:16,597
I have killed a dozen
in a single day. More!

121
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,644
- I tell you, senor, there is no justice.
- What if they don't find out?

122
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,731
- But they will.
- Not if you ride south with me.

123
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:31,152
Against 50 guns, maybe more?
The odds are not good.

124
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:35,115
Better than you'll have
against that wall tomorrow.

125
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,242
You've got a point.

126
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,744
Well?

127
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:43,789
- What is the pay?
- Whatever it takes to get you out.

128
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:48,043
- Fair enough.
- How much?

129
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,297
- But, senor, I cannot.
- A hundred pesos.

130
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:53,758
- They will stand me against the wall...
- 200.

131
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:56,302
- I have a wife, six little ones...
- 250.

132
00:21:56,427 --> 00:21:59,055
Three. But I cannot let him go.

133
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,974
He will have to escape.

134
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:05,603
- Unlock it.
- Un momento, senor.

135
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,778
Do you mind if I escape
first thing in the morning?

136
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,909
Hello, Chris.

137
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:09,789
It's gettin' so a fella can't find
an unattached woman anywhere hardly.

138
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:12,792
Let's get out of here.

139
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:31,143
Whew! That was a close one, huh?

140
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,397
So was the last time.
And the time before that.

141
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:39,151
- When'll you ever learn, Colbee?
- How'd I know she was married?

142
00:23:39,276 --> 00:23:43,863
Women ain't like cattle, with a brand to
let you know they're another man's stock.

143
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:49,119
How would you like to use that gun belt
for more than just holding up your pants?

144
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:53,623
A village was raided, a friend of mine
taken prisoner. I need help.

145
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,834
Well, I'd like to
give you a hand, Chris, but...

146
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,338
They took all the men...
drove them into the desert.

147
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:03,841
I ain't been gettin' much sleep lately.

148
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:09,596
- Took off all the men, you say?
- Two days ago.

149
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:14,643
You mean
there's a village full of women...

150
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:19,565
.. and no one there to help them
with their plantin' and their harvestin'?

151
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,568
- No husbands?
- No husbands.

152
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:27,572
The hell you say.

153
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:02,076
How'd you do?

154
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:07,795
They any good?

155
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,432
They're alive.

156
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:20,888
Hey!

157
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:24,015
Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doin'?

158
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:29,422
- Basta con el pequeno.
- He said the little one had enough.

159
00:26:29,557 --> 00:26:32,103
- But I had my money bet on him.
- You lost.

160
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:35,009
Why, you...

161
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:29,074
The little one's had enough.

162
00:27:31,756 --> 00:27:34,616
Touch that gun, I'll kill you.

163
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:41,185
Are you all right?

164
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,992
Si, senor.

165
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,599
Senor... Me llamo Manuel.

166
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:10,274
Yo he oido que busca pistoleros.
? Podria llevarme?

167
00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:15,277
He says his name is ManueI.
He heard we were looking for fighters.

168
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:18,048
He'd like to come along.

169
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:27,877
- You're gonna take him?
- For luck.

170
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,900
Counting Chico, that makes seven.

171
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:48,543
Buenos dias. It's a lovely day, no?

172
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:51,336
- You're late.
- I overslept.

173
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:54,717
Let's get the hell outta here!

174
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:56,950
Gracias.

175
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,582
- Coffee?
- Oh.

176
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:06,418
Don't mind if I do. Don't mind at all.

177
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:17,179
You'd never know she's around,
would you, quiet like she is?

178
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:22,852
Had me a quiet woman once.

179
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:25,397
Outside she was calm as Sunday.

180
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:28,108
Inside she was wild
like mountain scenery.

181
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:31,736
I'm gonna ride back that way again
one of these days.

182
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,739
- Where's that?
- Sonora Town.

183
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:38,160
- I was there once.
- Once?

184
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:40,954
- You mean you didn't go back?
- For what?

185
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:45,751
Well, there's over ten head of females
for every male in Sonora, that's for what.

186
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:49,631
And I oughta know. I went through
over half of 'em one night.

187
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:54,512
And woulda got around to the rest of 'em
if I hadn't pulled a leg muscle.

188
00:31:54,802 --> 00:31:58,641
I was buckin' horses this side of the line
and sellin' 'em tame up in Deming.

189
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,894
Now, a good amount of 'em
was no more than hoorah girls,...

190
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,981
.. but the way I look at it,
a woman's a woman.

191
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:07,568
Ain't that right, Frank?

192
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,320
You talk too much, Colbee.

193
00:32:12,405 --> 00:32:16,118
Since when can a man
talk too much about a woman?

194
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,166
- Since when?
- Colbee!

195
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:29,424
- You take the first watch.
- But you said Vin was a'gonna.

196
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,175
I changed my mind. Go on.

197
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:55,492
You didn't have to do that, Chris.

198
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:59,163
I wouldn't push him into a fight,
if that's what you think.

199
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:03,042
If you had, you might have
been in trouble. He's fast.

200
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:06,672
Fast as you are?

201
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:10,801
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.

202
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:13,179
I'll remember that.

203
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:18,184
Do that.

204
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:35,661
I wonder why the hell
they took Chico and them others off.

205
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:38,122
Damned if I know.

206
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:42,002
Time we get to the village, blowsand will
have covered up any tracks.

207
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:46,047
If we strike out blind,
we don't stand a chance of findin' 'em.

208
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:53,555
Petra said there were
two other villages raided.

209
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,516
That means they took
close to 300 prisoners.

210
00:33:57,934 --> 00:34:01,356
Only one way to move
that many men on foot in the desert.

211
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,565
Like cattle.

212
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:05,818
From one water hole to the other.

213
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,947
Well, that don't
narrow it down too awfuI much.

214
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:11,992
Lotta cow trails
between here and the Sierra Madre.

215
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,787
Herds moving on them every day.

216
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:17,372
Word gets round.

217
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:21,793
What do we do in the meantime?

218
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,132
Drop Petra and the boy off at the village
and start riding a wide circle.

219
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:31,011
- See if we can cut their traiI.
- That could take one hell of a long time.

220
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,516
I know. I haven't been
goin' anywhere for ten years.

221
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:39,520
Vin, if you have to
worry about something,...

222
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:46,738
.. worry about what happens after we find
Chico and the others, not if we find them.

223
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:05,571
I never thought I'd come back.

224
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,487
Vin, Colbee. Cut him down.

225
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:09,848
- Get 'em out of here.
- Llevatelos de aqui.

226
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:41,321
He escaped -
and see what they did.

227
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,825
My poor little one.

228
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,545
The DeviI's Spine.

229
00:38:56,671 --> 00:39:00,508
It ranges from the headwaters
of the Concho, north to the border.

230
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:05,347
According to the woman, her husband
escaped from a village about here.

231
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:08,141
That's where they're holding
Chico and the others.

232
00:39:08,267 --> 00:39:11,562
- Did he say why?
- He wasn't there long enough to find out.

233
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:15,816
But there ain't no village between
the DeviI's Spine and the Concho.

234
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:20,195
- That's what the man said.
- He was a long time in the desert, Chris.

235
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:23,448
He coulda been out of his head,
got turned around.

236
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:27,454
- He found his way here, didn't he?
- I'll catch up the horses.

237
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:30,039
We'II leave in the morning.

238
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,836
Ride out tonight, we could save time.

239
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,424
Use up our animals, we'll be on foot.

240
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:41,011
We'II leave in the morning.

241
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,389
Better get some sleep.

242
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:48,853
You too, Colbee.

243
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:13,920
I wish to hell I knew for sure.

244
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:16,506
Knew what?

245
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:23,138
If I'm here because Chico's a friend, or if
I'm just on the prod for a fight like Frank.

246
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:25,307
Killin' can get inside of you.

247
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:28,227
And you think that's happened to you.

248
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:30,396
Why else would I be here?

249
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,814
Sure, Chico's a friend of mine, but...

250
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:35,734
Hell, I don't even know his last name.

251
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:38,779
Neither do I.

252
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:42,242
Don't it make you wonder?

253
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:45,120
No.

254
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:47,789
How the hell come, Chris?

255
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:52,627
Because in all the years
I've made my way with a gun,...

256
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:56,131
.. I never once shot a man
just to see him fall.

257
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:58,801
That time ever comes,...

258
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,429
.. I throw my guns
in the water bucket and ride out.

259
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:07,185
So will you.

260
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:32,462
- Who does he belong to?
- His parents are dead.

261
00:41:33,547 --> 00:41:36,424
Chico looks after him like he was his own.

262
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:42,139
Chris, why would they take
Chico and the others away?

263
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:47,061
- I don't know.
- Maybe...

264
00:41:47,187 --> 00:41:50,732
.. if you went to the Rurales,
asked for help.

265
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:54,737
- It wouldn't do any good.
- But they are supposed to protect us.

266
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:59,491
- Have they ever?
- No.

267
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:02,119
They never will.

268
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:04,704
Because we are poor.

269
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,000
Because we cannot pay them.

270
00:42:09,084 --> 00:42:11,379
That's true, isn't it?

271
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:17,302
- Maybe someday it'll be different.
- And in the meantime?

272
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,680
We do what we can.

273
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:24,059
And die.

274
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:27,563
There's always that.

275
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,732
Chris.

276
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:35,571
No matter what happens,...

277
00:42:35,696 --> 00:42:39,200
.. we will never forget you, and the others.

278
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:44,456
That's all a man can ask.

279
00:43:57,784 --> 00:44:02,121
If you ask me, we ought've stayed on back
there and given them women a hand.

280
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:05,751
They're gonna fall behind
in their plantin' and ploughin'.

281
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,336
So will you, Colbee. So will you.

282
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,969
How come you're still along, Luis?

283
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:19,974
Thought once you got clear of that
firing squad, you'd head for the hills.

284
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,935
- So did I.
- What changed your mind?

285
00:44:23,396 --> 00:44:26,022
Well, I had a long talk with myself.

286
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:30,652
I said "Luis, in all the years
that I've known you,...

287
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:34,990
.. you've not done one thing
for anyone but yourself. "

288
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:38,911
"Not one. And it's
about time that you did. "

289
00:44:39,036 --> 00:44:44,166
"Where would you be if it was not for
the poor farmers you've stolen from?"

290
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:47,504
"You would be nothing.
Help these poor people,...

291
00:44:48,297 --> 00:44:52,675
.. and you'll be able to ride proud,
with your head high up. "

292
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:55,596
If somebody don't blow it off.

293
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,307
Then I would die in good company.

294
00:44:58,433 --> 00:45:02,561
Hell... Chris there,
he's been killin' for ten years.

295
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:05,815
Vin, about half that time.

296
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:09,651
Colbee, he hunts other men's wives
between gun jobs.

297
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:13,239
ManueI's nothin' but a chicken thief.

298
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:15,409
And you?

299
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:19,371
- I'm no better than they are.
- But you're still along.

300
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:22,875
You coulda run for the hills, same as me.

301
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,920
I got my reason for stayin'.

302
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:29,674
And it don't have one damn thing
to do with friendship,...

303
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,259
.. or helpin' poor farmers.

304
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,759
- Buenas tardes, compadre Lorca.
- Buenas tardes, compadre.

305
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:13,596
Have you seen the priest?
He was looking for you.

306
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:16,641
- Again?
- He heard about the killings.

307
00:46:16,766 --> 00:46:19,351
He said we should have
tried to reason with them.

308
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:23,774
Reason?
Did I build an empire upon reason?

309
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:27,361
Did we reason with renegades,
bandits, corrupt officials?

310
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:30,572
But these are not renegades, nor bandits.

311
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:36,703
- Nor are they corrupt.
- You never tire of being my conscience.

312
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:39,248
"The strong must be
generous to the weak. "

313
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:42,250
You know who made up
that rule? The weak!

314
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:49,843
Francisco, I have to talk to you.
Two workers were killed last night.

315
00:46:49,968 --> 00:46:53,471
- They were trying to escape.
- But you have no right.

316
00:46:54,973 --> 00:46:58,018
Look, Father. I know
your feelings for these people.

317
00:46:58,144 --> 00:47:01,689
But would it be a more honourable death
if they fell pulling a plough?

318
00:47:01,814 --> 00:47:06,402
- The Church cannot sanction...
- Sanction? You wanted a church.

319
00:47:06,527 --> 00:47:09,322
You couldn't pray it into existence
so you came to me.

320
00:47:09,446 --> 00:47:13,743
- You chose this place, these methods.
- For a reason.

321
00:47:13,868 --> 00:47:17,163
What reason can there be
for killing in cold blood, Francisco?

322
00:47:17,288 --> 00:47:21,460
- You wouldn't understand.
- I understand murder, slavery.

323
00:47:23,045 --> 00:47:27,758
Look, Father. I set out
to rebuild this church, this village,...

324
00:47:27,883 --> 00:47:31,679
.. and that is what I'm going to do,
with or without your blessing.

325
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:34,265
I cannot stand by
and let this go on, Francisco.

326
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:39,187
- Nothing says you have to stay.
- Everything says I have to stay.

327
00:47:43,817 --> 00:47:47,362
He is right, Father.
You should leave this place.

328
00:47:47,487 --> 00:47:49,531
- I can't.
- You mean you won't.

329
00:47:49,657 --> 00:47:51,909
I mean I can't.

330
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,421
- Buenas tardes, senor.
- Buenas tardes.

331
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:43,341
What can we do for you?

332
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:46,928
A friend of mine.

333
00:48:47,053 --> 00:48:49,389
You're holding him prisoner.

334
00:48:50,473 --> 00:48:54,227
I want him. And all the others.

335
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,271
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

336
00:48:57,647 --> 00:49:01,109
You are either a very stupid
or a very brave man, senor.

337
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:04,195
One word from me
and you would be dead.

338
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,948
That'll make two of us.

339
00:49:07,073 --> 00:49:10,993
There are five Winchesters
pointed at your head.

340
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:24,173
Professionals.

341
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:28,886
- Professionals.
- Perhaps we should have a little talk.

342
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:31,389
We just did.

343
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:35,601
- Father, you'd better get Francisco.
- Don't move, Father.

344
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:39,188
- You would kill a priest?
- Only if I have to.

345
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:44,027
Same old Chris.
I might have known you'd be along.

346
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:47,155
It's good to...

347
00:49:58,374 --> 00:50:00,960
Whatever you and your men
are being paid,...

348
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:04,297
.. I'll double it. I'll triple it.

349
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:08,342
- Same old Lorca.
- Come. We will talk.

350
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:12,597
- Can't do that.
- That's the only thing you can do.

351
00:50:12,722 --> 00:50:16,726
You're six against 60.
Don't expect these farmers to help you.

352
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:19,437
They have no stomach to fight.

353
00:50:19,562 --> 00:50:21,606
- No?
- No.

354
00:50:30,782 --> 00:50:32,909
Kill him.

355
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:36,287
Go on. Kill him.

356
00:50:37,538 --> 00:50:39,999
You've killed others.

357
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:47,799
- But they didn't have guns.
- They had guns three years ago...

358
00:50:47,924 --> 00:50:51,552
.. when 200 men gave up their lives
inside the walls of this church.

359
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:54,389
Gave up their lives
to rid this country of tyranny.

360
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:56,849
Do you think it concerns these farmers...

361
00:50:56,974 --> 00:51:01,896
.. that I tracked bandits across miles of
desert and fought them on this ground...

362
00:51:02,021 --> 00:51:05,233
.. while they hid under their straw beds?

363
00:51:07,652 --> 00:51:10,154
Mis hijos.

364
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:15,702
My sons. Tall, erect,
like two well-bred stallions.

365
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:19,247
They're buried here with the others.

366
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:23,459
No longer will their graves
be marked by ruins.

367
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:26,129
This church, this village,...

368
00:51:26,254 --> 00:51:29,465
.. will be a monument
for those who fought so well.

369
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:34,178
A monument built with the sweat
and blood of those who never fight.

370
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:37,765
I'll prove it to you. Lopez.

371
00:51:38,224 --> 00:51:40,476
Do as he says.

372
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:44,897
- Kill him.
- Francisco!

373
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:49,402
- You stay out of this, Father.
- I have stayed out of it as long as I can.

374
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:53,906
I beg you, Francisco, before it is too late.

375
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:57,910
Before God damns you to hell
for what you are doing here.

376
00:52:02,749 --> 00:52:05,126
You spared my life once.

377
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,546
Now I'm going to save yours.

378
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:11,257
Take your vaqueros and ride out of here.

379
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:13,968
Ride out and don't look back.

380
00:52:15,595 --> 00:52:17,972
I was wrong.

381
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:20,308
You're not the same old Chris.

382
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:25,563
I won't let you drown your grief in other
men's blood, if that's what you mean.

383
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:28,608
Go on.

384
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:30,985
Get out.

385
00:52:43,331 --> 00:52:46,000
Pues morimos, compadre.

386
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,800
!Muchachos! !Vamonos!

387
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,621
There will be a next time.

388
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:27,458
!Vamonos!

389
00:53:42,515 --> 00:53:44,767
He will be back.

390
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:48,354
I know.

391
00:54:07,915 --> 00:54:10,543
I swore I would never wear this again.

392
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:15,548
What a man swears and what he does
isn't always the same.

393
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:20,219
It's good to see you, Chris.

394
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,597
Good to see you, Chico.

395
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:25,933
Is it?

396
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,937
Lorca has many men out there.

397
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:33,441
I've been shot at before.

398
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:37,403
But we cannot pay you to help us, Chris.

399
00:54:41,074 --> 00:54:43,117
I knew a young gun once.

400
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:46,079
He was a wild,
mostly drunk kid when I met him.

401
00:54:46,204 --> 00:54:48,706
Turned out to be a man.

402
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,918
Man enough to set his gun aside,
take a wife,...

403
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:54,420
.. try to amount to something.

404
00:54:55,505 --> 00:54:57,965
He also turned out to be a friend.

405
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,595
- Worth dying for?
- If I have to.

406
00:55:04,305 --> 00:55:06,724
What about the others?

407
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:10,144
They're along for the fight.

408
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,314
If it wasn't this one, it would be another.

409
00:55:14,399 --> 00:55:17,318
Get up in the bell tower.
Watch off toward the cemetery.

410
00:55:17,443 --> 00:55:20,405
If they come, it'll be from there.

411
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:23,574
And Chico.

412
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,161
Don't get too attached to that gun.
When this is over...

413
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:31,541
I'll throw it in the water bucket...
and ride out.

414
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:07,201
I did not know it would come to this.

415
00:56:09,704 --> 00:56:13,958
When Francisco lost his sons
I tried to give him consolation.

416
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:20,089
He told me he wanted to build
a monument to those who had fallen.

417
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:23,259
I convinced him it should be a church.

418
00:56:24,677 --> 00:56:26,929
I wanted it as much as he did.

419
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,683
Even more.

420
00:56:30,808 --> 00:56:34,729
As God is my judge, I have tried
to help these poor souls,...

421
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,690
.. tried for so long.

422
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:40,902
I've spoken to them of faith,...

423
00:56:41,778 --> 00:56:43,821
.. of love.

424
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:46,949
They believed me.

425
00:56:47,617 --> 00:56:51,537
But my words and their prayers
have changed nothing for them.

426
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:54,916
The children have died,...

427
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:57,085
.. the crops have failed.

428
00:56:57,835 --> 00:56:59,879
And now I have betrayed them.

429
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:02,465
I'm not a religious man, Father.

430
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:06,386
But I'll tell you this.

431
00:57:06,511 --> 00:57:10,348
They need you.
More now than ever before.

432
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:15,186
I failed them.

433
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,065
You failed yourself.

434
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,776
Got knocked down.

435
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:24,278
Get up, Father.

436
00:57:24,737 --> 00:57:27,198
At least as far as your knees.

437
00:57:57,437 --> 00:57:59,814
That's the last of 'em. Now what?

438
00:57:59,939 --> 00:58:04,027
- We movin' out tonight?
- We're not moving out at all.

439
00:58:04,527 --> 00:58:08,448
Catch us in the open with 300 men
on foot, we won't have a chance.

440
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:12,160
- We gonna stand it out here?
- We got cover, we got supplies.

441
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:16,330
And they have to come to us.
That cuts the odds in half.

442
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:19,876
They won't lay out there very long.

443
00:58:20,001 --> 00:58:24,088
Like as not they'll try to
get it over with as fast as they can.

444
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:27,800
- I wish to hell these walls were higher.
- They will be.

445
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:30,970
You and Frank
split the workers in two groups.

446
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:34,515
One take the south wall,
the other take the north.

447
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,729
Get rocks, timbers, adobe blocks,
anything a man can stay alive behind,...

448
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:42,106
.. and start building.

449
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:44,942
- Now?
- Now.

450
00:59:55,013 --> 00:59:57,056
The storm is over.

451
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:00,143
It's a long day's ride
to the hacienda, compadre.

452
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:04,981
Would you have me run from seven guns
and those farmers? Those cowards?

453
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,900
All we have left
is the ammunition in our belts,...

454
01:00:08,026 --> 01:00:11,195
.. the water in our canteens,
and the food in our stomachs.

455
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,656
That is enough.

456
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:17,410
That is more than enough.

457
01:02:03,975 --> 01:02:06,853
!Vamonos, muchachos! Adentro.

458
01:03:09,374 --> 01:03:11,834
!Vamonos, muchachos! !Vamonos!

459
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:18,443
I don't know about you,
but that scared the hell outta me.

460
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:24,157
- You reckon they'll hit us again?
- Just as hard as they can.

461
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:05,717
Bring me a horse!

462
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:08,094
Come on!

463
01:06:47,175 --> 01:06:49,218
Are you all right, compadre?

464
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:51,804
I will make them suffer for this.

465
01:06:52,472 --> 01:06:55,099
I will make them all suffer for this.

466
01:06:55,558 --> 01:06:58,311
Lopez, you may ride to the hacienda.

467
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:01,397
Get every man that works for me.

468
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:04,233
Every boy old enough to carry a gun.

469
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:07,278
The farmers, the vaqueros.
Bring them all here!

470
01:07:07,612 --> 01:07:11,032
But if I do that,
you will have nothing to go back to.

471
01:07:11,157 --> 01:07:15,161
The cattle will scatter into the hills
and the crops will faiI in the fields.

472
01:07:15,286 --> 01:07:17,747
All you have worked for, compadre.

473
01:07:17,872 --> 01:07:21,793
AII I have worked for
is buried beside that church.

474
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:24,379
My sons.

475
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:28,216
Do as I say, compadre.

476
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:53,449
Funny how your mind'll play tricks on ya.

477
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:57,870
Up there, when they was comin' at us,
I got to thinkin' they were husbands.

478
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:01,082
- Husbands?
- Ganged up on me.

479
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,751
Sent a shiver up my spine.

480
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:08,005
I swear, we get outta this, I ain't
ever gonna look at another woman. Ever!

481
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:10,425
- Agh!
- Oh. Sorry.

482
01:08:18,057 --> 01:08:20,143
Looks like they're gonna wait for night.

483
01:08:20,268 --> 01:08:24,605
They hit us in the dark, it could get
kinda hard to stay alive in here.

484
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:29,944
We make a run for it, we can be back
at the village in two days, maybe less.

485
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:32,405
- And then what?
- Make our stand there.

486
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:35,074
What about the women and children?

487
01:08:37,326 --> 01:08:39,370
Yeah.

488
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:43,833
Looks like you should have
turned me in for that bounty.

489
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:47,003
About that bounty, Chris.

490
01:08:47,128 --> 01:08:49,380
There never was a price on ya.

491
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:52,842
I just wanted to ride
along with you for a ways.

492
01:08:55,428 --> 01:08:58,306
- Well, maybe they'll back off.
- Not Lorca.

493
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:02,310
He won't let go
till this is over once and for good.

494
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:05,688
You seem like you know him pretty well.

495
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:08,274
I was paid to kill him once.

496
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,943
Shame you didn't get the job done.

497
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:14,364
By his sons.

498
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:38,763
His sons?

499
01:09:40,473 --> 01:09:45,061
He said they were tall, erect,
like finely bred stallions.

500
01:09:46,062 --> 01:09:48,106
They weren't.

501
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:50,942
They were gentle, like their mother.

502
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:54,195
Lorca thought they were weak.

503
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:58,241
He rode roughshod over them trying
to make them over in his own image.

504
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:00,410
Their mother tried to stop him.

505
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:02,829
Died trying.

506
01:10:02,954 --> 01:10:05,832
They hated him, wanted him dead.

507
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:09,001
So they hired you.

508
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:11,170
Lorca found out about it.

509
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:13,756
He could have had me killed.

510
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:16,551
Instead he gave me a horse,
let me ride out.

511
01:10:17,468 --> 01:10:19,929
Don't know why.

512
01:10:21,222 --> 01:10:23,808
Maybe he saw in you
what he never saw in his own.

513
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:25,977
Maybe.

514
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:30,606
Wonder how come
the two of 'em ended here.

515
01:10:30,732 --> 01:10:33,401
Knowing Lorca, he shamed them into it.

516
01:10:33,526 --> 01:10:36,571
Then why is he building
this church for 'em?

517
01:10:37,405 --> 01:10:39,991
Not for them, Vin. For him.

518
01:10:41,117 --> 01:10:45,705
He got his chance to do the one thing
he could never do when they were alive.

519
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:48,291
Be proud of them.

520
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:07,769
What are they waiting for?

521
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:16,986
I wish now that Petra
had never found you, Chris.

522
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:20,365
That you'd never gotten into this.

523
01:11:22,492 --> 01:11:25,870
You and the others get killed,
what good will it do?

524
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,332
Nothing will change.

525
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:33,086
No matter what happens here,
nothing will change.

526
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:37,507
There'll always be someone like Lorca,...

527
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:40,301
.. someone to push men around like cattle.

528
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,892
I've seen enough of fear,...

529
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:50,478
.. running, hiding.

530
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:59,028
When this is over,
I'm heading north across the border.

531
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:02,448
I made my living with a gun once.

532
01:12:02,907 --> 01:12:05,159
I can do it again.

533
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:09,330
What about Petra?

534
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:14,335
Man runs out on his own people, doesn't
leave a wife a whole lot to be proud of.

535
01:12:17,338 --> 01:12:19,632
She'll understand.

536
01:12:20,717 --> 01:12:22,969
Will she?

537
01:14:07,448 --> 01:14:10,952
Chief Lopez
went to the hacienda.

538
01:14:11,077 --> 01:14:14,580
Tomorrow he'll bring 400 guns.

539
01:14:14,706 --> 01:14:17,709
If he does,
this will soon be over.

540
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:23,089
t- The sooner, the better.
- I agree.

541
01:14:29,512 --> 01:14:32,223
You'll get that old bird drunk,
you don't watch out.

542
01:14:32,348 --> 01:14:34,809
No entiendo.

543
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:38,229
Tu hacer ese pajaro borracho.

544
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:44,402
Hey, hello, Chris. Uh,...

545
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:48,489
.. ManueI here, he's got somethin'
he wants to tell ya.

546
01:14:48,614 --> 01:14:51,242
Go on, ManueI. Tell him.

547
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,578
Todo este tiempo...

548
01:14:53,703 --> 01:14:56,539
No, no, no. You tell him what I taught ya.

549
01:14:56,789 --> 01:14:59,250
Hable en ingles.

550
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:03,296
For a long time...

551
01:15:06,299 --> 01:15:08,343
No, compadre.

552
01:15:09,093 --> 01:15:11,512
What he's tryin'
to tell you, Chris, is that...

553
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:16,809
.. for a lotta years now he's been knockin'
around from one village to another.

554
01:15:17,769 --> 01:15:20,438
He ain't got no folks
that he can remember.

555
01:15:20,563 --> 01:15:23,649
He don't even know how old he is
except he's young and, uh,...

556
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:27,737
.. he's been called ManueI ever since
he was knee-high to a grasshopper.

557
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:31,574
Another thing he remembers is that
he always felt kinda lost and lonely.

558
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:35,411
- But he don't no more. Know why?
- No. Why?

559
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:39,707
Because when I was out there stompin'
around in the rain last night,...

560
01:15:39,832 --> 01:15:45,046
.. I come across a sign with the name of
the village on it. Something "DeI Norte".

561
01:15:45,171 --> 01:15:47,632
- First part of it had been burned off.
- So?

562
01:15:47,757 --> 01:15:51,094
So, ManueI was always
lookin' for some place to come from,...

563
01:15:51,219 --> 01:15:54,430
.. some place he can belong to,
be proud of. Now he can.

564
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:57,392
Village ain't got no people,
he ain't got no village.

565
01:15:57,517 --> 01:16:02,313
- So from now on they can call him...
- ManueI from Something DeI Norte.

566
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,733
Yeah! It's got a nice ring to it, ain't it?

567
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,778
Yeah.

568
01:16:10,196 --> 01:16:12,657
Uh, Chris. Um...

569
01:16:14,742 --> 01:16:18,454
Anyhow, uh... Think we oughta
get him outta here safe?

570
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:22,542
You know, he ain't
a whole lot with a gun, and, uh,...

571
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,170
.. they keep comin' at us
that way, he's gonna get hurt.

572
01:16:26,295 --> 01:16:29,007
Maybe we could
send him off somewheres.

573
01:16:29,924 --> 01:16:32,176
If we did, I'd sure feeI a whole lot better.

574
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,470
What about him?

575
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,639
How'd he feeI?

576
01:16:36,764 --> 01:16:39,684
Now that he's finally
got something to belong to.

577
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:41,853
Yep...

578
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,897
Frank was right.

579
01:16:45,982 --> 01:16:47,650
I talk too damn much.

580
01:17:06,878 --> 01:17:09,130
It's Frank!

581
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,052
- You all right?
- Just a crease.

582
01:17:14,177 --> 01:17:16,763
Were you tryin' to get
your head blowed off?

583
01:17:16,888 --> 01:17:19,057
It's my head.

584
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:24,062
You get yourself killed,
it won't do anybody any good.

585
01:17:24,187 --> 01:17:26,689
Depends how you look at it.

586
01:17:29,442 --> 01:17:31,819
What's eatin' him?

587
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:40,912
I saw you up there
on the wall this morning.

588
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:43,956
Now this.

589
01:17:44,082 --> 01:17:46,918
- Why?
- None of your damn business.

590
01:17:50,129 --> 01:17:52,173
Chris.

591
01:17:53,383 --> 01:17:55,927
You never knew my wife, did you?

592
01:17:56,803 --> 01:17:59,097
We had us a place in West Texas.

593
01:17:59,222 --> 01:18:04,519
Wasn't much, just gettin' started. Had
a herd to build, wire to string and such.

594
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:08,815
One night some Comanches got drunk,...

595
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,819
.. jumped the reservation,
lit out, killin', burnin'...

596
01:18:12,944 --> 01:18:16,948
We woke up, they was all
around the cabin - 1 4, 1 5 of 'em.

597
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:21,452
I held 'em off as long as I could
till I only had one shell left.

598
01:18:23,788 --> 01:18:26,582
Ellie screamed at me
not to let 'em take her alive.

599
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:29,919
She'd... seen what they'd done to others.

600
01:18:31,963 --> 01:18:34,841
She kept beggin' me, beggin'...

601
01:18:36,718 --> 01:18:38,344
So I...

602
01:18:41,973 --> 01:18:44,267
The Comanches saw what I'd done.

603
01:18:45,268 --> 01:18:49,856
I thought they'd kill me too,
but they didn't. They just rode off.

604
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:54,027
Next morning I started trackin' 'em.

605
01:18:54,694 --> 01:18:58,322
Killed 'em one at a time,
all the while hopin' they'd kill me.

606
01:18:58,448 --> 01:19:02,243
Five years, I've been tryin'
to get the job done.

607
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:07,081
But it don't look like
I have to wait much longer.

608
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:09,834
I heard 'em talkin' out there.
Lorca sent for help.

609
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:13,254
Come tomorrow he's gonna
have 200 guns, maybe more.

610
01:19:13,379 --> 01:19:16,466
And he's not gonna
settle for just us, Chris.

611
01:19:18,176 --> 01:19:20,803
He wants 'em all dead.

612
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:23,389
Every last one of 'em.

613
01:19:37,111 --> 01:19:39,155
Senor...

614
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,618
The others, they have
asked me to talk to you.

615
01:19:45,536 --> 01:19:50,958
They don't want you
to die here because of them.

616
01:19:52,335 --> 01:19:54,671
Go.

617
01:19:54,796 --> 01:19:57,465
While there is still time.

618
01:19:58,174 --> 01:20:00,635
They will not kill us all.

619
01:20:02,178 --> 01:20:06,307
Those who are left
will return to the village,...

620
01:20:08,559 --> 01:20:10,812
.. begin again.

621
01:20:11,354 --> 01:20:13,815
If we are strong like you...

622
01:20:14,482 --> 01:20:17,360
But we are not. We are weak.

623
01:20:18,194 --> 01:20:21,656
- Too weak to fight.
- You fight every day of your lives.

624
01:20:22,532 --> 01:20:25,034
You fight the land to grow crops.

625
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:28,329
You fight to keep a roof over your heads,
clothes on your back.

626
01:20:28,454 --> 01:20:31,582
- That is not the same.
- The hell it's not.

627
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:35,503
We are cowards, senor.

628
01:20:35,628 --> 01:20:38,715
We are afraid of everyone, of everything.

629
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:43,511
Our whole life is one of fear.

630
01:20:45,346 --> 01:20:47,598
We are born with it.

631
01:20:48,474 --> 01:20:50,852
We die with it.

632
01:20:50,977 --> 01:20:55,398
It is our way. It will always be our way.

633
01:20:56,315 --> 01:20:58,735
Please, senor.

634
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,112
We beg you.

635
01:21:01,571 --> 01:21:03,948
Before it is too late.

636
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:08,119
Go... please.

637
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:35,229
You ain't thinkin'
of runnin', are you, Chris?

638
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:37,732
He may be right.

639
01:21:40,276 --> 01:21:44,030
I knew a fella once.
He was loud, always braggin'.

640
01:21:45,073 --> 01:21:47,742
Inside he was afraid of his own shadow.

641
01:21:47,867 --> 01:21:51,537
Never woulda got over it either,
if this other fella hadn't come along.

642
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:53,748
I'm talkin' about that night in Texas...

643
01:21:53,873 --> 01:21:56,751
.. when you made me stand
alongside you in the street.

644
01:21:56,876 --> 01:21:59,462
I remember you had to
knock me down four times...

645
01:21:59,587 --> 01:22:01,798
.. before I'd go against them guns.

646
01:22:03,299 --> 01:22:06,094
We got to do the same for them, Chris.

647
01:22:06,219 --> 01:22:10,765
We got to stand alongside of 'em
so that someday they can stand alone.

648
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:15,561
I thought all you did
was think about women, Colbee.

649
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:17,772
I used to be afraid of them too.

650
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:22,610
We ain't gonna run, are we, Chris?

651
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:25,613
Hell, no.

652
01:22:43,965 --> 01:22:46,592
Orate, frates.

653
01:22:57,687 --> 01:23:01,482
If you're thinkin' about goin' out there,
we'd better get at it.

654
01:23:01,607 --> 01:23:05,653
Those others get here,
the hills are gonna get higher to climb.

655
01:23:05,778 --> 01:23:08,072
How many men does he have left?

656
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:10,450
I counted 30.

657
01:23:11,075 --> 01:23:14,162
We could circle high around
and come at 'em from behind.

658
01:23:14,287 --> 01:23:16,789
One chance in hell.

659
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:20,251
That's better than none at all.

660
01:23:23,046 --> 01:23:25,048
Saddle the horses.

661
01:23:25,173 --> 01:23:27,425
I already did.

662
01:24:18,643 --> 01:24:20,687
Tu quedate aqui.

663
01:24:20,812 --> 01:24:22,980
Ain't you gonna take him with us?

664
01:24:23,106 --> 01:24:27,026
- He'll cover us from the bell tower.
- We'll need all the help we can get.

665
01:24:27,151 --> 01:24:29,487
He stays behind.

666
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:33,282
- For luck?
- For luck.

667
01:25:09,736 --> 01:25:11,362
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.

668
01:25:11,654 --> 01:25:13,698
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.

669
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:05,226
Chris!

670
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:09,772
Hey! Come on!

671
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:40,595
Chris!

672
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:43,139
Keep going.

673
01:27:54,233 --> 01:27:56,903
Ya! Giddap! Ya!

674
01:30:11,704 --> 01:30:13,456
Chris!

675
01:30:29,263 --> 01:30:31,766
!Alto el fuego! !Alto!

676
01:30:42,318 --> 01:30:44,362
Vamonos.

677
01:31:13,057 --> 01:31:15,393
I got it done, Chris.

678
01:31:16,269 --> 01:31:18,521
I finally...

679
01:31:28,281 --> 01:31:30,324
Chris.

680
01:32:15,453 --> 01:32:17,830
Kill them. Kill them.

681
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:26,172
Don't stop. Kill them.

682
01:32:26,923 --> 01:32:28,966
Kill them.

683
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:10,466
It was Chico's idea
to finish building the church,...

684
01:33:10,591 --> 01:33:13,761
.. to bring all three villages here
and make them into one.

685
01:33:13,886 --> 01:33:16,973
- I thought you were heading north.
- I changed my mind.

686
01:33:17,098 --> 01:33:19,225
- I'm ready to go, Chico.
- Go where?

687
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:23,312
- Well, back to get the rest of the women.
- He volunteered.

688
01:33:24,647 --> 01:33:27,275
- So long, Colbee.
- So long, Chris.

689
01:33:40,788 --> 01:33:43,249
Too bad the others
couldn't have seen this.

690
01:33:43,374 --> 01:33:46,753
We'll remember them in our prayers.

691
01:33:46,878 --> 01:33:50,214
- Goodbye, Chico.
- Chris.

692
01:33:51,632 --> 01:33:53,885
So long, Padre, Chico.

693
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:56,471
- Adios.
- God bless you.

694
01:34:30,338 --> 01:34:32,382
I'll be damned.

695
01:34:34,092 --> 01:34:36,427
I doubt that.

696
01:34:36,552 --> 01:34:39,013
I doubt that very much.
