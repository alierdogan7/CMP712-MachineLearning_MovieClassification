1
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:44,933
Red Valley! All aboard!

2
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,445
It's empty.

3
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,813
Let's go.

4
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,863
I know how you feel, boys.

5
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,340
Being cleaned out is no joke,
any way you look at it.

6
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,869
Still, there's a good side to this.
I've learned my lesson and so have you.

7
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,175
We sure have, Clanton.

8
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,239
We're through putting our money
in your bank.

9
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,844
Don't forget about them killings, neither.
It's blood money now.

10
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:12,753
I think you're making a mistake, friends,
as far as my bank is concerned.

11
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,623
Look what I had sent from Salt Lake City.

12
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,668
Say, she's built like a battleship, Clanton.

13
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,598
It'd take a battleship to blow her open,
Uncle Willie.

14
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,867
Just came a little too late though, didn't it?

15
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,569
No! Not at all!

16
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:35,375
I aim to pay back part of
what everybody lost out of my own pocket.

17
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,651
Are you fooling?

18
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,085
Why, I've got a funny way of fooling.

19
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,352
Mortgaging every thing I have
to raise the money.

20
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,186
I've never heard a banker talk
like that before.

21
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,889
Now, don't thank me!
Don't thank me, friends.

22
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:55,128
I won't be able to pay you back
more than fifty cents on the dollar.

23
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,228
But at least you don't lose everything...

24
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:03,873
and I can let you have some cash now
to tide you over.

25
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,174
I invite you to step inside
and do your banking.

26
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,008
That invitation's good enough for me.

27
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,016
Come on, boys. The line forms on the right.

28
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,881
That's the spirit, Uncle Willie.

29
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:17,218
What's good enough for you ought to be
good enough for everybody in Red Valley.

30
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,559
Pay off everybody 50%.

31
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,670
Need a little money, Mr. McLeod?

32
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:38,876
I thought I told you
there was to be no killing by Jack Lester.

33
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,742
They'll forget it.

34
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,112
Killing's never forgot,
and it leads to more killing.

35
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,778
- You made a bad mistake, Clanton.
- Why blame me for the killing?

36
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:52,086
You were supposed to bring in someone
from out of town to do the job.

37
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,194
Sam Glennon in Leadville
was to send me a man.

38
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,822
He was to be here days ago,
but he didn't turn up.

39
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,991
He'd have done a clean job,
from what Sam said.

40
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:05,527
Maybe so, but we couldn't wait forever.
That's why I called in Jack Lester.

41
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,232
Here's his share.

42
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,301
Finding out he blew an empty safe
must be getting him hot under the collar.

43
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,311
You're a fool, Clanton.

44
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,075
People can stand losing money
but they hunt down killers.

45
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,947
- I told him not to shoot.
- You didn't tell him loud enough.

46
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,452
- Willie, you heard me say...
- Shut up!

47
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,046
You're a great man
in this town now, Clanton.

48
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,058
I guess you're even greater
than Santa Claus.

49
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,161
These suckers will be getting back
half of what they put in...

50
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,790
and naming their children after you.

51
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,302
- How much did we clear?
- $80,000.

52
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,936
That's good.
That calls for a drink on the house.

53
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,499
Here's to your health, Mr. Clanton.

54
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,971
That's not a bad amount
to get out of a town this size.

55
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,811
It's nothing to what we can get later...

56
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,375
if that contract from the army
comes through for the horses.

57
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,855
Santa Claus don't drink.

58
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,234
Whoa.

59
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,976
Hey, Jack! You home? Willie McLeod.

60
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,705
Jack Lester!

61
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,773
- I'm here.
- Hello, Jack.

62
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,910
Morning, gents.

63
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,419
Nice to see you all looking so bright
and happy.

64
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,522
It's gonna be a lovely day.

65
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,996
Jack, I brought you a present.

66
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,571
$10,000, cash money,
and you don't have to thank me.

67
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,703
Looks like you ain't gonna.

68
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,406
You fellas look like you done something
you're ashamed of.

69
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,640
I ought to blow your head off.

70
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,310
- That don't seem like friendly talk.
- Not the least bit friendly.

71
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,582
I don't trust you and Clanton
any more than you trust me.

72
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,751
Why, Jack, where did you ever
get the feeling we didn't trust you?

73
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,483
The other night in the bank.

74
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,359
The minute I found out
I'd blew an empty safe.

75
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,832
- You're a little too smart, Uncle Willie.
- You ain't quite smart enough.

76
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,529
Three men murdered in cold blood.
What's the sense to it?

77
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,127
We was robbing a bank.

78
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,173
I'm a lot older than you, Jack.

79
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,574
In my time I've seen a lot of men
with itchy trigger fingers like you.

80
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,214
They're all in Boot Hill with dirt in their face.

81
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,682
Somebody cured them of that itch.

82
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,776
Would you like a couple of holes
in that big fat belly of yours?

83
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,654
You're holding up the U.S. Mail
and that's a federal offense.

84
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,649
- Hello, Uncle Willie.
- Hello, Sheriff.

85
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,119
You're behind time.

86
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,893
You ought to be in Basin City
with the mail by now.

87
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,863
I've been backtracking to find you.

88
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,196
One of my mules got a loose shoe
and I was held up.

89
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:26,237
- What you doing in this neck of the woods?
- Just looking around.

90
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,535
Anything special on your mind?

91
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,839
One of the bank robbers forgot something
the other night.

92
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,674
- He did?
- This.

93
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,775
Part of a spur, ain't it?

94
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,481
Hammered silver rowel.
Unusual for this part of the country.

95
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,354
Ever noticed anyone with a pair like them?

96
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,518
No, can't say that I have.

97
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,428
You get around a lot, and I was counting
on you to give me a lead.

98
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,956
When a man gets as old as I am,
his memory goes first.

99
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,268
Maybe some fellow in silver spurs
has passed me...

100
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,534
and neither hear nor see him.

101
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,438
If I do hear or see him,
I don't remember it afterwards.

102
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,476
A man can't do much when he gets old
except save his money.

103
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,950
Stay out of mischief.

104
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,056
Hey, Uncle Willie.

105
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,462
You forgot to give me back
that piece of spur.

106
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,026
Spur? What spur?

107
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,198
That silver-hammered rowel
I picked up in front of the bank.

108
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,710
- You didn't give me no spur.
- Sure I did. Take a look.

109
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,912
Maybe you put it in your pocket.

110
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,490
- Is this it?
- That's it.

111
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,723
That just goes to show you
how forgetful a man of my age can get.

112
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,695
If you hadn't remembered giving it to me...

113
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,163
you probably never would have
got that spur back.

114
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,224
- Don't forget the way home.
- I might any day now.

115
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,099
- So long, Steve.
- So long.

116
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,493
Reach, and don't turn around.

117
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,062
Reach.

118
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,875
I got a lame horse here. We're gonna trade.

119
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,571
- I wouldn't like that.
- That's too bad.

120
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,620
Now don't turn around.

121
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,078
- Anybody here?
- Yes.

122
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,283
- Take care of my horse, ma'am?
- You bet.

123
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,029
Don't usually see a girl running a stable.

124
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,592
Belongs to my father, Will McLeod.

125
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,338
- Did you say McLeod?
- Know him?

126
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,539
Sure. I've heard of him.

127
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,841
Everybody in this part of the country
knows him.

128
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,077
- You from around here?
- Nope.

129
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,710
My name's Allison McLeod.

130
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,682
Pleased to meet you.

131
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,256
I didn't quite catch your name.

132
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,588
I didn't give it.

133
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,670
- Nice horse you got here.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,734
- Bet you had to pay plenty for him.
- Too much.

135
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,579
Found plenty of dust, too, didn't you?

136
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,013
The north trails are full of it.

137
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,918
And there's red mud
between here and Basin City, too.

138
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,783
- You've seen a lot of country, haven't you?
- Not as much as you.

139
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,830
Red Valley's kind of new to me.
What's it like?

140
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,704
Sleepy and quiet.
Once in a while we raise a crop of horses.

141
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,568
That isn't all.

142
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,609
- Adios, brother.
- Have you known your horse long?

143
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,118
Time doesn't matter.
We fell in love at first sight.

144
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:13,018
- Isn't that a dangerous habit?
- Not when you get used to it.

145
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,789
I'll be coming back here tonight
to see my horse.

146
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,661
- You be here?
- I'll be waiting.

147
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,868
The Commercial House is a block down.
You'll find that more suitable.

148
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,465
This suits me.

149
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,534
- I'm afraid we have no vacancies.
- Look again.

150
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,542
- I'm very sorry, but...
- Is there anything wrong?

151
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:13,711
I believe this gentleman has ambitions
beyond his means, Countess.

152
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,954
I think we can afford
a little charity occasionally.

153
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,824
Follow me.

154
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,161
Thank you.

155
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,735
- Cheyenne!
- Take it easy, Countess. I'm only a visitor.

156
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,275
What are you doing here?
There's $10,000 on your head.

157
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,810
- Are you crazy?
- Nitro come in yet?

158
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,846
Yes, he's been here for days
waiting for you.

159
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,006
He said something about a bank job.

160
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,243
- Is it the kind of a job I think it is?
- Yes.

161
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,306
The Clanton Bank?

162
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,353
I think that's the name
Sam Glennon told me.

163
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,650
Hell, that job's already been done.

164
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,826
Now you'd better move
before somebody recognizes you.

165
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,660
Somebody already recognized me
on the way from Salt Lake City.

166
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,064
I had to travel the long way around.
That's why I'm late.

167
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:06,070
- I sent Nitro on ahead to wait for me here.
- I thought you were quitting.

168
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,868
So did I, but they won't let me.

169
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,575
I've tried a dozen times.
Every time I got started...

170
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,374
somebody remembers my face
and wants that $10,000.

171
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,405
Then I get hunted down like a coyote.
What else can I do but keep on?

172
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,249
Come on, sit down.

173
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,948
This will do.

174
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,620
You don't have to sit
facing the doors in here.

175
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,665
Sort of a habit with me.

176
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,597
- You're kind of jumpy, aren't you?
- Maybe.

177
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,798
How long has it been
since you've seen my folks?

178
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,066
About six months.

179
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,700
Your sister's a very pretty girl.
You'd be proud of her.

180
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,267
- How's my kid brother?
- Good boy. Straight as a string.

181
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,813
You're not heading out that way, are you?

182
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,017
It's Nitro.

183
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,918
Oh, my boudoir!

184
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,794
Cheyenne, welcome to Red Valley.

185
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,130
How do you like the little blowout
I gave you?

186
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,106
You big zombie, you...

187
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,336
I told you to leave that nitroglycerin alone.

188
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,844
I was leaving it alone.

189
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:25,009
But you see, if it gets a little too warm
or a little too cold...

190
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,177
- My knee.
- What's the matter? You hurt?

191
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,347
Yeah, that marble top fell on it.

192
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,290
- Help me.
- Help him? I'll break his other leg.

193
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,056
Don't pick on me. I ain't done nothing.

194
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,295
- Countess. What...
- There's nothing to get excited about.

195
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,666
Just a lamp exploded.

196
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,967
Tim, get inside.
The rest of you, go back to work.

197
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,371
Go on, hurry up. Shut the doors.

198
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,644
Take it easy. Tim, look at his leg, will you?

199
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,946
The bottle that went off was just that big.

200
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,346
Any bigger, and you'd be picking me up
with a spoon.

201
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,940
I wish we were!

202
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,409
Funny how a little noise upsets a woman.

203
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,925
They won't believe
that exploded lamp story.

204
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,194
The help here get enough pay
to believe anything.

205
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,828
I'll send Nitro after you
as soon as he can ride.

206
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,930
I hope it's before he blows me all over Utah.

207
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,473
I'm staying.

208
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,410
Cheyenne, this town is right on the railroad.

209
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,539
Somebody's bound to come through
and spot you.

210
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,676
- We won't be here for long.
- But why sit around and wait for him?

211
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,210
I was sitting in a jail in Colorado
and Nitro waited for me.

212
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,883
When he was through waiting,
I bet there was no jail left.

213
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,687
Just a hole in the ground.

214
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,556
Please go. I'll take good care of him.

215
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:50,627
Don't you see? I can't leave a man
who'd put his neck in a noose to save me.

216
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,740
Sure. I see.
You just want to commit suicide.

217
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,693
- Hello, Steve.
- Hello, Allison.

218
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,827
- You look like you could use another horse.
- I sure could.

219
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,100
- But how did you know?
- You tell me how you lost your horse first.

220
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,199
- Somebody held a gun on me and we traded.
- Know him?

221
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,268
I didn't see him.
He made me keep my back turned.

222
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,906
A horse was brought in today
with red mud on him.

223
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,610
The kind you run into
on the way to Basin City.

224
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,519
So I came out here expecting
to find somebody dead or walking.

225
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,854
You mean somebody brought my horse
in the stable?

226
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,350
Who?

227
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,387
I don't remember his name.

228
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:55,133
Sure you can't remember anything
about him, Allison?

229
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,899
Yes, Steve. The way I remember him,
he wouldn't come out last in a gun fight.

230
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,266
He seems awfully quick, Steve.

231
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,900
Have you ever seen how fast I can duck?

232
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,775
Don't tell me you're going to break down
and worry about me.

233
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,973
Don't you think it's about time?

234
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,201
Evening, Miss McLeod.

235
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,444
Hello. Your horse is back there.

236
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,645
Thanks.

237
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,752
Hello, brother.

238
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,793
Reach.

239
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,732
Reach, and don't turn around.

240
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,306
You're under arrest.

241
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,578
I got him, Steve.

242
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,949
You certainly did.

243
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,553
First time a woman
ever finished a fight for me.

244
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,531
Get some water, Allison.
This is a friend of mine.

245
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,632
- A friend?
- Yeah, hurry up.

246
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,140
Quick.

247
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,148
Douse him.

248
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,385
- Hello.
- How do you feel?

249
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,621
I'm all right.

250
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,301
- Surprised to see you.
- Same here.

251
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,869
- That a star on your vest?
- Yeah. I'm Sheriff of Red Valley.

252
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,373
Can I do anything?

253
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,535
- What'd you hit me with?
- A bucket.

254
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,375
- You sorry?
- How was I to know you were friends?

255
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,574
Here, let me wipe your face.

256
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,578
You got a funny way of greeting strangers
in this town...

257
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:05,282
- but you're awful nice to them afterwards.
- You don't seem to be a stranger.

258
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,587
We used to be partners back in Wyoming.

259
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,718
That was my horse you borrowed.

260
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,626
- Your horse?
- Yeah, didn't you know?

261
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,426
No, I was in a hurry...

262
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,228
and I left some money in the saddlebag.
Didn't you find it?

263
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,429
No. We'll settle the deal tomorrow.
Come on.

264
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,799
I think you need a drink.

265
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,934
If you'll bring Mr. Smith,
I'll make some coffee.

266
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,502
That is what you said your name was,
didn't you?

267
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,071
Yes, Smith. Bill Smith.

268
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,906
Come on, Bill Smith.

269
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,576
Sure is a funny way to treat a horse thief.

270
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:40,550
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Al. Hi, Steve.

271
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,026
Horse kick this fella?

272
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,060
Yeah, on the head.

273
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,762
There ain't a worse place to get kicked.

274
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,167
Man sometimes is silly the rest of his life.

275
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,864
Mr. Smith's all right.

276
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,237
- This is my Dad.
- I'm glad to meet you.

277
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,208
Bill Smith's an old friend of mine.

278
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,473
That so?
I ain't seen you around here before, son.

279
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,542
I'm from Leadville.

280
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,619
I know a fella there name of Sam Glennon.
Know him?

281
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:13,317
Yeah. Come to think of it,
he told me to look you up when I arrived.

282
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,257
Small world, ain't it?

283
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,522
We're going to make Mr. Smith
some coffee, Dad.

284
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:21,828
- I'll fix your supper while I'm at it.
- I'll unhitch my mules and be right in.

285
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,098
Sure is a small world.

286
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,987
They all seem to be enjoying themselves.

287
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,923
Yeah, they've got a right to.
They'll have to pay for it later.

288
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,857
I'm crazy about you, Jack.

289
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,192
Are you crazy about me?

290
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,169
I'd be crazy if I was.

291
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,240
You're lying.

292
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,070
Jack, would you die for me?

293
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,978
You would if you loved me enough.

294
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,878
I'm the kind of a woman
who drives men to...

295
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,247
...kind of a woman who wants
to drive men to drink.

296
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,515
- A dangerous woman. I want men to die for...
- Shut up.

297
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,296
- Who'd you smile at?
- A horse thief.

298
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,106
- He here?
- Over against the wall.

299
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,413
Seems to be a wallflower tonight.

300
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,314
Some people like to be wallflowers.

301
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,116
It gives them a chance
to keep their backs against the wall.

302
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,556
What's he like, Steve?

303
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,954
A little faster with a gun
than anybody I ever knew.

304
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,759
- Evening, Mr. Smith.
- Good evening.

305
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,264
They dance well.

306
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,069
She does.

307
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,238
That is, they do.

308
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,741
- I'm surprised to find you still in Red Valley.
- That so?

309
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,778
Ain't much a fellow like you
can do here now.

310
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,085
Appears to me
as if you'd be getting kind of restless.

311
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,648
I'm satisfied.

312
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,788
If you should need a little traveling money,
I could help you out.

313
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,093
I don't.

314
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,662
You got here too late, Smith.

315
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,735
I don't know what you're talking about.

316
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,709
Bill, I got a girl here
who wants to dance with you.

317
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,877
My feelings won't be hurt if you refuse.

318
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,308
I won't refuse.

319
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,514
- Thanks, Steve.
- You're not welcome.

320
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,091
It was nice of Steve to lend me his girl.

321
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,188
I'm not his girl to lend.

322
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,563
It was nice of Steve anyway.

323
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,801
- It's a surprise to see you here tonight.
- Why?

324
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,442
For a lot of reasons.

325
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,085
- Only one reason why I came here tonight.
- What's that?

326
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,244
You.

327
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,680
I don't think I'm going to ask you
any more questions.

328
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,160
Something the matter, Countess?

329
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,663
- No, nothing.
- I thought maybe I stepped on your foot.

330
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,036
But you will, probably.

331
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,540
Steve, would you and Uncle Willie
mind stepping outside for a minute?

332
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,633
Sure, Hank.

333
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,076
We have some responsible citizens
gathered there...

334
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,740
- and we'd like to have you join us.
- What's going on?

335
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,306
You'll find out when you get there.

336
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,051
Come on, Uncle Willie.

337
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,485
Here he comes now, Judge.

338
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,292
Well, boys, what'll it be?

339
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,635
As the legal law in Red Valley,
I represent a body of citizens...

340
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:59,234
that want to do something
about those men killed in the bank robbery.

341
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,904
You don't seem much concerned.
Well, we are.

342
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,778
That's right, Steve.
Can't blame them for wanting action.

343
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,874
You can't get action
till you know who did it.

344
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,714
When will we know? It looks to me...

345
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:12,154
like you spend most of your time
loafing around the country or dancing.

346
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,453
That's no way to catch murderers
and bank robbers.

347
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,891
I have to work my own way.

348
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,726
And while you're doing so,
what's to prevent it from happening again?

349
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,356
We got a lot of money coming into this town
from that horse contract.

350
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,063
If you don't get them robbers,
they're apt to be back.

351
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,595
These horses we are selling to the army
are about all we have left.

352
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,472
- They won't come a second time.
- That's what you say.

353
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,011
My word's either good or it's not.

354
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,912
To me that don't mean a thing.
I want to see a hanging.

355
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,348
Why, a law officer ought to be out
on the trail, not in a dance hall...

356
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,285
hopping around
like a frightened mountain goat.

357
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,754
Any time enough people want me to resign,
I'll do it.

358
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,418
- That's all I've got to say.
- That's good enough for me.

359
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,290
- For me, too.
- Have a drink.

360
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,523
There's plenty of girls in there.

361
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,897
Have a drink, boys.
Get inside and enjoy yourselves.

362
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,041
- You worried about Steve?
- Yeah. A little.

363
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,709
I think being sheriff means a lot to him.

364
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,379
It means being able to stay here.

365
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,079
Any man would want to do that.

366
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,494
- In kind of a bad spot, ain't you?
- They can't expect miracles.

367
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,257
When I arrest him,
I want to know I've got the right man.

368
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,299
I wish I could help you.

369
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,324
Have you uncovered anything at all?

370
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,236
- I got an idea the man I want is Jack Lester.
- Jack Lester?

371
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,268
- Why, he's only a common rancher.
- Uncommon, Uncle Willie.

372
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,177
He's got a ranch
and he doesn't run any livestock on it...

373
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,878
and he's got three hired hands
to help him do nothing.

374
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,683
- You must be mistaken, Steve.
- I'm getting surer every day.

375
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,422
Do you remember the silver rowel
I showed you?

376
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,120
He used to wear a set of silver spurs
and he doesn't wear them anymore.

377
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:02,360
And I always thought Jack didn't have
a dishonest bone in his head.

378
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,197
This is the most terrible thing
I ever heard of, Steve.

379
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,500
Keep this quiet, Uncle Willie.

380
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,048
- Did you hear what he said?
- No.

381
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,346
I got a surprise for you
and it won't be pleasant.

382
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,476
I'm waiting.

383
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,418
He's sure Jack Lester is the man he wants.

384
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,515
As soon as he gathers up a couple
of loose ends, he's going to have him jailed.

385
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,958
That wouldn't be very pleasant
for either one of us.

386
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,622
- Dad.
- Where you bound, Al?

387
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,666
Home, to get something to eat.
If you're hungry, come along.

388
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,758
I'll be along in a little while.

389
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,229
I've got another surprise for you.

390
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,537
See that fellow over there
with Allison and Steve?

391
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,134
That's the Countess' cousin, Bill Smith.
What about it?

392
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,978
He's also the man Sam Glennon
was sending me from Leadville.

393
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,049
That's enough surprises for one night.

394
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,709
- Hey, where are you going?
- Home.

395
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,879
I've got to chaperon my daughter.

396
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,489
- What's ailing the old buzzard now?
- Plenty.

397
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:07,053
- Lester, I got a couple of surprises for you.
- Yeah?

398
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Pleasant surprises.

399
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,168
- Well, had enough of my cooking?
- Plenty.

400
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,102
That's a fine thing to say.

401
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:18,333
- You know what I mean.
- I'll take all I can get. Some other time.

402
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,999
That's better.

403
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,458
Nice place, Red Valley.

404
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,761
What brought you here?

405
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,328
I thought I'd like to see the Countess.

406
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,925
What's keeping you, besides Allison?

407
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,197
Nitro's up at the Countess' with a bad foot.

408
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,738
You and Nitro Rankin?

409
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,112
- That's a funny combination.
- Nitro did me a favor once.

410
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,946
Do you know anything
about the bank robbery we had here?

411
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:11,118
I know one thing, Steve,
I had nothing to do with that robbery.

412
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,091
Do you believe me, Steve?

413
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,329
What you say
has always been good enough for me.

414
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,598
Thanks.

415
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,833
Why don't you stay here in Red Valley?

416
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:27,776
I'm wanted, Steve.
You can get $10,000 for me.

417
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,313
I don't want you at any price.

418
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,282
- Like some more coffee?
- Not for me, Allison. I gotta be going.

419
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,950
So do I.

420
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,984
- You're welcome here any time, Bill.
- Thanks.

421
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,051
- What about me?
- You're part of the family.

422
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,455
That's the trouble. Goodnight.

423
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,590
- Goodnight, Miss Allison.
- Goodnight.

424
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,164
Goodnight, Uncle Willie.

425
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,934
- Through with your courting, boys?
- For tonight, yeah.

426
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,704
Yeah, having a daughter's a real trial.

427
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,809
Man with a son
can get all the sleep he needs.

428
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,078
But with a daughter you can't close
your eyes until everybody's gone home.

429
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,583
Thanks.

430
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,196
How do you like him, Al?

431
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:25,627
The way you do a book when
you don't know how the story turns out.

432
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,972
Books have happy endings.

433
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,034
This story could have a happy ending.

434
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,308
Does it matter what he's been?

435
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,829
All right, come on!

436
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,537
- Come on.
- Get it on.

437
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,967
Come on, boy.

438
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,623
Oh, for Pete's sake.

439
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,767
- Enjoying yourself?
- Kind of.

440
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,166
I got a job here breaking wild horses.
Horses the ranchers are selling to the Army.

441
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,142
A job? Are you crazy?

442
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,205
I must be, with a job like this.

443
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,373
Come on home with me. You want a job,
I'll give you one dealing faro at the hotel.

444
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,547
I like it here.
I get $3 for every horse I break.

445
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,614
I'll give you $50 for every sucker you break.

446
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,217
You'll get killed here, one way or another.

447
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,126
- No, thanks.
- Why?

448
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,502
I'm kind of changing my ways.

449
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,437
Aren't you kind of forgetting who you are?

450
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,373
I'm trying my best to, Countess.

451
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,972
All right,
I'll be by later and pick up the body.

452
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,021
Easy, boy.

453
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,596
You'll get used to a load on your back.
Everybody does.

454
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,998
He won't mind that in a little while.

455
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,094
Howdy. That's just
what I've been telling him.

456
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:19,039
Sometimes I feel sorry for them, though.
It's hard to lose that kind of freedom.

457
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,737
That depends on what you trade it for.

458
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,082
Are you working here now?

459
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,682
- It doesn't seem like your kind of job.
- Well, it isn't.

460
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,782
Then why are you doing it?

461
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:40,290
I answered that question the other evening,
or do you want me to tell you again?

462
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,203
I said I wasn't going to ask you
any more questions, didn't I?

463
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,509
Okay. Come on.

464
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,985
Listen to me.

465
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,450
Smith came to town to rob the bank,
didn't he?

466
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,490
Suppose you said so
in a crowded place where everybody...

467
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,262
Where everybody could hear you?
He's a stranger.

468
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:55,897
He's got no good reason for being in town.
He might find that hard to explain.

469
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,635
And Red Valley would sooner believe you
than him.

470
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,939
Especially since you have me
backing you up.

471
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,175
- That's a good idea, Clanton.
- Yes, but there's one flaw.

472
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,079
Smith might give some good answers.

473
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,744
He'll never get the chance to answer.

474
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,594
Easy.

475
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,725
Maybe I ought to just pour this liniment
on you and let it soak in.

476
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,067
You only been working one day and you're
as banged up as a Republican in Texas.

477
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,733
- What will you be in a month?
- I ain't banged up.

478
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,869
Now, take me, I'm fine.
Leg don't hardly hurt at all no more.

479
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,707
Hey, not so hard.

480
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,275
All right, that's enough.

481
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,525
You ought to knock
before you come in here, Countess.

482
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,459
Suppose I was taking a bath or something?

483
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,125
If I ever hear of you taking a bath,
I'll start knocking.

484
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,633
- How do you feel, Cheyenne?
- Pretty good.

485
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,865
- Going out again tonight?
- Just down to see my horse.

486
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,407
Does your horse like you to wear a tie?

487
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,216
He hasn't said.

488
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,118
A fella can't be too good to dumb animals.

489
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,220
Aren't you forgetting something?

490
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,484
I'm through carrying it.
It's getting too heavy for me.

491
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:33,402
You know, I heard a song one night
about the other side of the mountain.

492
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,698
That's where I've been for a long time,
on the other side.

493
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,274
And I want to come back.

494
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,537
- But can you?
- I can try.

495
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,342
They say a man is through
when he develops one weakness, Cheyenne.

496
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,475
You're getting weak.
You'll put your neck in a rope.

497
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,780
I can't help it.

498
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,186
Please get away from here
as soon as you can.

499
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:55,783
Red Valley's no place for you
to start over again. Get across the border.

500
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,159
I'm Bill Smith now,
I'm not Cheyenne anymore, and I like it here.

501
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,757
You're not Bill Smith,
you're Cheyenne Rogers, you always will be.

502
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,324
You're in too deep to ever get out.

503
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,369
I've been on the other side
of that mountain for a long time.

504
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,874
But I know I never can come back.

505
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,872
Maybe that's the difference between us.

506
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,988
No use getting serious, Countess.

507
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:30,185
Falling in love with him
is just building up for a quick goodbye.

508
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,126
He's gotta keep on traveling.

509
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,824
Nitro, did you ever want
to live your life over again?

510
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,801
Me? I couldn't stand the excitement
twice in a row.

511
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,735
Cheyenne and I were raised together
in Wyoming.

512
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,708
We went to the same school,
the same church.

513
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:50,040
We were like brother and sister.
I was gonna be a school teacher.

514
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,777
He was going to raise the best horses
in Wyoming.

515
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:58,287
You know, I always figured he didn't get
any pleasure out of gun fighting.

516
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,414
Then came the gold strike.

517
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,549
Claim-jumpers moved in on my father's land,
killed him.

518
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:09,526
I called on Cheyenne for help.
He came, there was a fight.

519
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,860
Some of the men were killed.

520
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,305
From then on, Cheyenne's been
a hunted man, and I'm responsible.

521
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,773
Don't you feel bad.

522
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,937
A fellow with his talent for throwing a gun
shouldn't waste it.

523
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:25,175
I ought to hit you,
but I'm afraid you'll explode.

524
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,653
- Bill, heading for the barn?
- Hello.

525
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,488
Allison ain't there right now.

526
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,896
I was just going down to look at my horse.

527
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:46,027
Steve was in to see his horse
little while ago.

528
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,470
Seems like there ain't nothing
more Ionesome than a Ionesome horse.

529
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,871
Except maybe a Ionesome man.

530
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,341
A man don't need to be if the saloon's open.

531
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,277
I just gave up chewing tobacco for rum.
Have a drink with me.

532
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,145
- No, thanks.
- Come on, one little drink won't hurt you.

533
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,547
All right.

534
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,568
Drink hearty, gents. Tonight's my last night.

535
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,571
- Selling out?
- Lock, stock, barrel and goodwill.

536
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,668
I've been building here for 10 years
and keeping dry while I did.

537
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,714
Tomorrow I take my first drink
and start back for Connecticut.

538
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,681
Red Valley's gonna miss you, Dan.

539
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,184
I ain't gonna miss Red Valley.

540
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:38,813
No, sir, a man's got a big responsibility,
running a place like this.

541
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,120
Keeping friendship and goodwill,
protecting his glassware.

542
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,216
I'm tired of it.

543
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,387
- Good luck to you, Dan.
- Thanks.

544
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,158
Here's to green pastures and no fences.

545
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,459
Hello, Jack. What'll you have?

546
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:56,700
Nothing but some answers
to a few questions, and from you, stranger.

547
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,837
- I don't answer questions.
- Now, Jack...

548
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,173
Shut up.

549
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,338
You're gonna answer mine.

550
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,076
Now, gents, this is a place for drinking,
not talking.

551
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,119
Name your poison
or I'll have to ask you to leave.

552
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,781
First I wanna know your name.

553
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:15,018
And speak up real loud
so everybody can hear you.

554
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,427
- Bill Smith.
- Louder.

555
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,191
- Bill Smith.
- Smith, huh?

556
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,532
Now, there's an unusual name.
Where are you from?

557
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:33,702
All over.

558
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,211
- What do you do for a living?
- Break horses.

559
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,111
You've been doing that one day. What else?

560
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,946
- None of your business.
- I'm making it my business.

561
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,145
You know what I think it is?

562
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,977
It's robbing banks.

563
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:46,352
I'm not carrying a gun.

564
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:49,790
Gents, please be friends.
It's a glass house here we're all living in.

565
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,318
Free drinks on the house.
Nothing like friendship and goodwill.

566
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,231
No gun?
That's mighty careless for an outlaw.

567
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,098
I say you robbed the Clanton Bank.

568
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,832
You're just waiting till we get more money
so you can rob it again.

569
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,341
Gents, please! Cut it out!

570
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,716
Gentlemen, please!

571
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,467
Whose bet?

572
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,333
- I'm at $10.
- I raise.

573
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,911
- Aces up.
- No good. Three 10s.

574
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,343
- All right, boys. He didn't fill his flush.
- Two pair.

575
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:54,046
Gentlemen, I'll have to ask you to leave.

576
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,096
- Raise $20.
- I call.

577
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:44,003
- What you got?
- Three queens.

578
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,868
The next time I meet you, Smith,
I'm gonna make sure that I...

579
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,735
Let's get along.

580
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,146
- What's on your mind?
- Nothing.

581
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,693
Shame you missed the fight, Steve.

582
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,762
Guess we didn't do the saloon much good.

583
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,464
Look, I thought you wanted to talk to me.

584
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,974
Not talk, Cheyenne, just say goodbye.

585
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,807
- Is that an order, Sheriff?
- Depends on how you take it.

586
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,074
I didn't even have a gun with me tonight.

587
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,514
Next time you meet Lester,
you'll have to kill him.

588
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,812
That's what I was thinking.

589
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,548
Then his three friends, then Red Valley
will have a famous gunfighter.

590
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,056
I thought you could stop here, Cheyenne...

591
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:44,685
but you can't any more than you could stop
in Wyoming or Colorado.

592
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,752
Maybe you never can stop.

593
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,961
Anyway, I can't let you kill Lester.

594
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,229
I'm saving him.
So if you stay here in Red Valley...

595
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,032
there'll have to be a showdown
between you and me.

596
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,472
- I figure we might as well have it now.
- Suit yourself, Steve.

597
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,339
I can't help myself.

598
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:03,374
I can't even help Allison
unless I get you out of here...

599
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,941
before she breaks her heart wishing
for something that's not in the cards.

600
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,451
It's tough to leave here now.

601
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,019
I know.

602
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,585
But you couldn't have a better reason
than her.

603
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,794
Or a better reason for staying.

604
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,459
If you're not gone by morning, Cheyenne,
I'll be coming for you.

605
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,406
Nitro's getting the horses.

606
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,347
See for yourselves, friends.

607
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,514
Good American money,
and better than coin in every way.

608
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,922
My, what'll they think of next?

609
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,484
Those bills are light, handy,
don't take up much space.

610
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,224
You can carry a large amount
without attracting attention.

611
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,358
- Is that so?
- You'll see the day come...

612
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,801
when a man wouldn't start out anywhere
without a supply of paper money.

613
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,860
- You don't say?
- Yes, sir.

614
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,397
The only thing you can't do with it
is fill your teeth.

615
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,619
- I guess you're kinda glad to get rid of us?
- I sure am.

616
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:30,462
That's the way I like to go.
Nobody misses me.

617
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,798
Keep on going this time, will you?

618
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,667
We won't be
running into each other anymore.

619
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,730
Let's not talk about it.

620
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,438
- Hey, what's the hurry?
- Hurry? Did it look like I was hurrying?

621
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,813
- So long.
- Come on, Cheyenne.

622
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,889
Don't worry about me, Countess.
I'll be all right.

623
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,759
You'll never be all right,
you old half-baked dynamite cooker.

624
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,257
Come on, let's go.

625
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,659
Why, what's the hurry?
We're not in any hurry.

626
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,135
- Yes, we are. I just robbed the bank.
- What?

627
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,496
Ride! Come on.

628
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,520
That does it.
Ben, Charley, Marty, Joe, Jim, follow me.

629
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:09,585
The rest of you cover this end
and get them in case they head back.

630
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,916
It's all over. Come on out
with your hands up and take your medicine.

631
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,888
- Let's shoot our way out of here.
- But we ain't got a chance.

632
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:43,892
- They're ten-to-one against us.
- Once in jail is enough for me. Come on.

633
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,392
You're too young to die, and so am I.

634
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,880
...4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

635
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:12,377
Well, gents, there's 12 of you here
and it takes 12 to make a jury.

636
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:16,721
Now we got two men here to hang,
but we're going to do it by the law.

637
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,088
- Hank, you be foreman.
- All right, Judge.

638
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,960
Lift your right hand.

639
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,768
Do you solemnly swear to put the law
on them bank robbers, so help you?

640
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:28,463
- I do.
- That's the stuff, Hank. Lower your hand.

641
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,769
We got to have a little evidence,
but very little.

642
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,975
Wait a minute.

643
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,672
- Holding up a bank's not a hanging offense.
- It ain't?

644
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:39,306
- It is if somebody's killed.
- They didn't fire a shot.

645
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,815
They fired plenty the other night.

646
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,408
Order in the court!

647
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:46,615
Jack, you mean to say that them fellows
did all the bank robberies?

648
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:50,484
I saw them kill three men
the night of the first robbery.

649
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:51,822
That's a lie.

650
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,422
Steady now, don't you go shooting
any witnesses, Sheriff.

651
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,729
We're gonna have law, all law
and nothing but the law in this court.

652
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,032
- Sit down, both of you.
- Listen to me, Judge.

653
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,595
Lester is swearing away the lives
of a couple of men...

654
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,972
because he got licked in a saloon fight.
I know Bill Smith here.

655
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:10,274
I've lived, eaten and fought with him.
We've dodged bullets together.

656
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,544
Some of them came from the law,
the kind of law you got around here.

657
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:17,713
Sit down! That ain't the kind of testimony
for a peace officer to be giving.

658
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,317
Your Honor, you got an eye in your head...

659
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,951
to see what a fine upstanding young man
Mr. Smith is.

660
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:28,691
Willie, no one asking you questions.
Besides you don't know about him anyway.

661
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,498
Sit down, Willie!

662
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,798
I aim to give Red Valley
a couple of hangings...

663
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,703
that they'll be proud of in days to come.

664
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,175
Any man that comes
between me and my doing it...

665
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:44,907
will get knocked higher than Gilroy's kite
with no due process of law at all.

666
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:49,708
Now let me hear the skunk that's changed
his mind after we been to all this trouble.

667
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,378
Let me hear him.

668
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:03,190
Only about 12 hours now
till you boys get some exercise.

669
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,790
Walking on air.

670
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:08,968
It ought to do you a lot of good
after all this sitting around.

671
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:13,769
Fellow runs into a mighty poor grade
of stock in a place like this.

672
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,945
Oh, hello, Smith.

673
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,985
Take a good look, my friend.
Pretty nice, ain't it?

674
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,684
It looks mighty trim.

675
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:33,627
You couldn't get a better stepping-off place.
Wait, I want to show you something.

676
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,534
Mighty slick, ain't it?
You're going out in style, Smith.

677
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,935
Makes me kinda glad I come here.

678
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,764
- Afternoon, Nitro.
- Hi, Judge.

679
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,376
Now, according to due process of law...

680
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,642
you condemned men
can make any last request you want.

681
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,740
Now, if you got one, speak up.

682
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,684
I got one, Judge. Keep your trap shut.

683
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,482
Keep your trap shut. That's a hot one.

684
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,993
How's he taking it?

685
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,526
Way a man like he is would.

686
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,295
Sits there and talks to Nitro.

687
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,032
Smokes too much
and waits for somebody to make a mistake.

688
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:20,509
- The way you would if you were in his place.
- There's nothing else to do.

689
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,169
He didn't kill those men, did he?

690
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,305
He didn't even rob the bank.
Nitro did that on his own.

691
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,713
I'm glad.

692
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,249
What can I do?

693
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:33,085
They want a hanging in Red Valley
and a man has sworn their lives away.

694
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,557
I'm Sheriff,
but I can't make my own law for friends.

695
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:42,122
Bill's what Dad calls from the other side
of the mountain, and he can't come back.

696
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,631
He tried, Steve.

697
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,430
He's hanging for something he didn't do.

698
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:50,234
I suppose a man has to die the way he lives.

699
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:53,699
Do you really believe that, Allison?

700
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,734
I'm trying to.

701
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,953
Here's lunch for the prisoners.

702
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,147
Let them out.

703
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,056
- Steve...
- I'll be responsible.

704
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,545
- Hi, Bill.
- Hello, Steve.

705
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:43,523
Same old stew.
I reckon a little pepper will liven it up some.

706
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,294
I won't be needing my hat anymore, Steve.
I'd kinda like for you to have it.

707
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,922
Thanks, but I can't take it, Bill.

708
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:53,560
Why not? It's a good hat.
I paid $40 for it in Santa Fe.

709
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,872
- Well, for old times' sake.
- Sure.

710
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,839
Why don't you put it on?
Let's see how you look in it.

711
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,941
How's this, Bill?

712
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:12,283
Why, the brim tips a little bit
to the left, kinda.

713
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,632
You're coming along with us, Steve,
just in case.

714
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:29,171
But you make one false move
and I'm gonna blast you.

715
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,934
I believe you would, at that, Cheyenne.

716
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,235
Back way.

717
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:42,778
Perfect.

718
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,183
Hi, Steve. Afternoon, boys.

719
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,726
Hi, Judge.

720
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,260
What is the meaning of this?

721
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,696
It means you can't keep your trap shut.

722
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,746
- This will be far enough for you, Steve.
- All right. Whoa, fellow.

723
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,682
Sorry it was your jail we had to break out of.

724
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,054
I didn't fall for that hat trick, Cheyenne.

725
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:29,030
We used it once in Deadwood. Remember?

726
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:37,268
Yeah, but do you think they'll fall
for that story back at Red Valley?

727
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,269
Why not?

728
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,836
I was careless, and I was surprised.

729
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,838
- There's been jailbreaks before.
- Sure there has, Sheriff.

730
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,077
- You ain't a bad fella as sheriffs go.
- Thanks.

731
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,452
This trail leads south.

732
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:56,117
Follow it to the end and when you get there,
keep going.

733
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,523
Good luck.

734
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,784
Adios, Steve.

735
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,792
You know,
there's something funny about this.

736
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,233
About what?

737
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:11,398
You may think I'm loco, but I got
a sneaking hunch the sheriff let us go.

738
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,203
Maybe you're right.

739
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:16,077
What are you stalling here for?
We was heading south.

740
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:19,512
- I'm going back into town tonight.
- Back into town? What for?

741
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,890
I'm going to see Sundown.

742
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,451
You pick up the grub and meet me here
when you got it.

743
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,498
- Let me know when you're here.
- We'll holler for you.

744
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,631
Sundown.

745
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:49,369
Looks like you're a shade slower
on the draw than you used to be, Cheyenne.

746
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,241
Cheyenne?

747
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,545
- Ain't I gonna get a chance?
- You had a chance.

748
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:02,618
- You can't shoot a man down like a dog.
- This is the other way around.

749
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,990
You sat here and let me walk into a trap.

750
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,961
They surprised me as much as they did you.

751
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,725
Ain't you stringing this out too long?

752
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,392
Why don't you kill him
and let's be on our way?

753
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,765
Cheyenne, you ain't serious, are you?

754
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,896
You're only joking.
Killing me don't make sense.

755
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:19,533
It never does,
to the fellow that's getting killed.

756
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:20,598
Let me talk.

757
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,009
Give me a minute
before you pull that trigger!

758
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:24,410
This is murder!

759
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,742
You tried to murder us.

760
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:28,579
A rope's a slow way to go.
I'll make it quick for you.

761
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,209
I've heard about you, Cheyenne.

762
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,379
You don't shoot people in cold blood.

763
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,286
That ain't what you said at the trial.

764
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,224
I'm sorry about what I said at the trial.
I didn't mean it.

765
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:40,729
- You're wasting your breath, Lester.
- No, Cheyenne, please wait!

766
01:01:40,797 --> 01:01:42,856
I'll cut you in on the whole setup.

767
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,422
Keep talking.

768
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,168
Clanton's in on this.

769
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,931
I never thought of making a partner
out of a banker.

770
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,269
All you got to do is say the word
and you're in.

771
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,208
I knew you'd talk, Lester,
standing at the other end of a gun.

772
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:58,404
Now you're going down the street with me
and make another speech.

773
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,915
Hey, Jack! Are you ready?

774
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,578
They're inside! Let them have it!

775
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,231
Allison.

776
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:36,777
Bill.

777
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,590
It's you! Was it you?

778
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,461
What are you doing here?

779
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:52,531
I came back here to make Lester
admit he lied about those killings...

780
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,626
in front of you.

781
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,694
You didn't have to do that.

782
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,400
I couldn't go away having you think
I was a killer.

783
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,271
I never thought that.

784
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,534
Say that again.

785
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,814
I never thought that. I couldn't think it.

786
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,079
That's what I wanted.

787
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:12,814
I'd almost given up caring
whether anybody believed in me or not...

788
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,456
- until I met you.
- I believe in you.

789
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,961
I'll always believe in you, Bill.
I can't help myself.

790
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,430
Please go, Bill.

791
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:36,272
I want you to take a message
to Steve for me. It's important.

792
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,438
Tell him that Jack Lester...

793
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:42,151
A fellow with a daughter can't leave home
for a minute, can he?

794
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,947
You'd better get going, quick.

795
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,146
You think so?

796
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,985
You ain't got any friends but us
left in Red Valley.

797
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,389
They put Steve in jail for letting you escape.

798
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,585
Jail?

799
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:55,925
It's true.
Give Dad the message you had for Steve.

800
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:59,696
I haven't got any message for Steve now.

801
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,999
But I do have one for that banker Clanton.

802
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:07,873
You tell him to get Steve out of jail
by tomorrow, or I'm coming back.

803
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,938
Come on, Cheyenne, let's go.

804
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,478
Go, Bill.

805
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,081
We've got to get Steve out of jail.

806
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:26,326
If we don't, Bill will come back.

807
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,924
I can't help Steve, Allison.

808
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,532
I just can't.

809
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,000
I'm out. Four blue chips.

810
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,376
I'm out, boys.

811
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,804
- This is a funny place for you to be.
- I know it.

812
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:18,870
The respectable women in Red Valley
only come here when they want a favor.

813
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:22,179
Like finding out how much their husbands
are losing at gambling.

814
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,082
- Was he here?
- Who?

815
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:29,149
Bill, before he got in that mess with Lester.

816
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:32,388
You can call him by his right name,
it doesn't matter now.

817
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,053
Cheyenne Rogers...

818
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,826
and you can get $10,000 for him,
dead or alive.

819
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:38,696
I want him alive and far away from here.

820
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,258
Why did you keep him hanging on?

821
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:43,066
- I didn't.
- You're the reason he stayed.

822
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,605
You were the reason he tried to change.

823
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:49,509
And you'll be the reason
he'll finally put his head in a rope.

824
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,270
He mustn't come back again.

825
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,941
If he's found out Steve's in jail,
nothing can stop him.

826
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,450
One thing could. If Steve got out.

827
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:57,778
Not a chance.

828
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,321
Clanton's a big man in this town...

829
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,220
and you have a lot of influence with him.

830
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,487
If he said to release Steve, they'd let him go.

831
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,051
It's too late.

832
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:11,091
They want Cheyenne so much,
they'll hold Steve just to get him back here.

833
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,067
You can try, can't you?

834
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,798
You're a pretty cool customer.

835
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,499
You'll save him now, if you can...

836
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,701
but you wouldn't save him
when you should have.

837
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:24,075
You could have sent him on his way
with a few words.

838
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,048
I couldn't say those few words
and tell the truth.

839
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,881
Let him come and be strung up,
if he's foolish enough...

840
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:34,252
I don't care what happens to me,
you, Steve or anybody else...

841
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:37,690
but I want him alive! Do you understand?

842
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,593
Sure, I understand.

843
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,599
You'll have your heart busted up
in so many pieces...

844
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,136
you'll have to carry it around in a sack.

845
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,241
Goodnight, Miss.

846
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,530
Good afternoon, my friend.
What can I do for you?

847
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:25,501
Nothing. What are you doing
for yourself, Clanton?

848
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:29,076
Everybody who can carry a six-shooter
will be out tonight.

849
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,113
He'll have plenty against him if he comes.

850
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,377
Instead of waiting for him,
we should be celebrating the arrival...

851
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,681
of the last of them Army horses tonight
to fill our bank with money.

852
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,618
You, Jack Lester, had to talk.

853
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:42,316
What would you do,
if your head was gonna be blowed off?

854
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,653
I'd keep my mouth shut.

855
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,626
Then keep it shut. You're in the same fix.

856
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:49,494
Stop arguing, will you?
We can't afford to fight among ourselves.

857
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,499
- Maybe he won't come.
- Shut up.

858
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,727
Countess, this is an unexpected pleasure.

859
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,467
Stanley, I hate to bother you
but I just had to see you.

860
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,634
- Any time, dear lady.
- Hello, Uncle Willie.

861
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:04,008
- Afternoon, Countess.
- Take the seat of honor, my dear.

862
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,809
Now, what can I do for you?

863
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:09,009
Maybe she wants
to find out her cousin's real name.

864
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,145
You know, it's too bad he didn't kill you
when he had a chance.

865
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,210
He'll get another one.

866
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:16,747
Mr. Lester, I'll thank you
to keep a civil tongue in your head.

867
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,561
Your wish is my command.

868
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,322
Stanley, I want you to release Steve for me.

869
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,798
- Steve?
- Yes.

870
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,329
What on earth for?

871
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,428
Cheyenne won't come here if he's free.

872
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:31,735
I'll never ask you to do another favor for me.

873
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,775
Countess, I can't do that.

874
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,640
Please, Stanley, for me.

875
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,508
Anything, but not that.

876
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,038
A man in my position
can't ally himself with criminals.

877
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,382
- Will you forgive me?
- Certainly.

878
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,015
Certainly, I'll forgive you...

879
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:50,058
you big, loud-mouthed, stupid old windbag!

880
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,428
Maybe we ought to do
what the Countess says.

881
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,127
Sure, let Steve out to find Cheyenne.

882
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,396
Then he'd get a posse together
in Basin City and come back for us.

883
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,405
I've got a bump on my head.

884
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,941
Make up your mind where you stand.

885
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:09,135
I'm in the middle.

886
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:12,806
You better be out on the street tonight,
on our side.

887
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,581
All right.

888
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,419
- Got a gun?
- Yeah.

889
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,884
I thought I had.

890
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:26,019
That's funny. I took it this morning.

891
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:30,289
I didn't think you'd misplace a thing
that big.

892
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:31,998
Here it is.

893
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,399
- Keep it ready.
- I'll be ready.

894
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,582
There go the horses for the Army into town.

895
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,019
Yup. The town will be full of money.

896
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:30,081
Until Clanton and Lester
blow that safe again.

897
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,118
We're going back into town. Come on.

898
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,993
Hey, you're crazy. We're traveling south.

899
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,059
Steve's got to get out of that jail.

900
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,363
Forget it. He's safe there.

901
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:43,530
- Why break our necks?
- He broke his neck for us.

902
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,269
Well, looks like we're going back.

903
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,440
- We sure are.
- Sure.

904
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,944
We just walk in, and they're waiting for us
with shotguns and ropes.

905
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,280
You see those horses down there?

906
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,686
That's the answer.
We're going to go in with them.

907
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,246
Yeah, but how?

908
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:03,788
We'll join the herd at dusk.

909
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:07,590
We'll pretend to help the wranglers
and go in with the horses.

910
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,131
Nobody will see us. No trouble at all.

911
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,599
No, no trouble at all.

912
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:14,563
Come on.

913
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,404
What are you doing?

914
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,439
Nothing much.

915
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:39,945
- How was the trip with the mail?
- No different than usual.

916
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:42,019
- Hungry?
- No.

917
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,821
The whole country's talking
about this fellow, Smith.

918
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,295
- Has anyone seen him?
- I guess not.

919
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,562
His real name's Cheyenne Rogers.
Do you hear that?

920
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:56,333
Real bang-up outlaw, they say.

921
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:59,703
Dangerous afoot, on a horse,
or laying on his back.

922
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:03,807
Wouldn't think so quiet-spoken a fellow
as him is bad, would you?

923
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:07,007
- They say he's a good bad man.
- There ain't no such thing.

924
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:10,074
A bad man's bad for himself
and everybody else.

925
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:18,882
Hope I never lose you, Al.
I might get some real bad habits.

926
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,760
What do you say we leave town for a while?

927
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,164
Let's catch a train this afternoon
to San Francisco.

928
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:30,371
We'll stay there until we can't stand
the sight of fog or salt water.

929
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,930
But what about the stable?
And you have the mail...

930
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:35,169
They don't matter,
we'll have ourselves a time.

931
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,735
Restaurants, theatres and parties for you.

932
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:40,281
Lots of nice clothes and jewels
in San Francisco...

933
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:43,318
and I'll buy myself a plug hat
and a Prince Albert coat...

934
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:46,354
so you won't be ashamed of me.
How does that sound?

935
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,356
- I can't go.
- Why?

936
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,892
Don't ask me why. I just can't go.

937
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,623
I don't have to ask.

938
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:59,390
I guess you dropped this out of your stuff
when you was carrying it out.

939
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,766
Maybe you'd better put it back.

940
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,800
Are you mad at me?

941
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:11,972
No more than when you caught the measles
and I got them trying to nurse you.

942
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:15,278
Nobody ever asked for the measles,
they just come.

943
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,084
Suppose he don't show up?

944
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:24,751
I hope he doesn't,
but if he does I'll be with him.

945
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:30,456
- I got a couple more deliveries to make.
- Dad...

946
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,093
How do you feel?

947
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,934
Like my father felt before me.

948
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,641
Ain't much difference
between fathers, honey.

949
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,997
Cheyenne, quit your fooling.
The whole town's gunning for us.

950
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,089
We can't make it.

951
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,134
You got any nitroglycerin with you?

952
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,669
- Be Ionesome without it.
- All right, now listen.

953
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:11,831
We're joining the herd here.
I'll get in front, you get behind.

954
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:15,536
When I give you the signal,
set off a charge that will stampede them.

955
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,341
- Yeah, then what?
- I'll be leading them, they'll follow me.

956
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:21,109
If your horse falls in the front
of them wild critters...

957
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,275
it'll be your last ride.

958
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,081
I'll run them into town
and I'll lose myself in the herd.

959
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,347
You're still crazy.

960
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:29,447
They'll be waiting in the street,
but not for long.

961
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,152
The stampede will soon clear it.

962
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:33,217
Yeah? What happens next?

963
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:36,587
I get to the jail and Steve gets out.

964
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,130
Then what?

965
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,664
I don't want to tell you the end.
You might lose interest.

966
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,470
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Smith.

967
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,777
I thought you were breaking horses
at the corral.

968
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,874
I decided to take a little vacation.

969
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,714
You need some help bringing them in?

970
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,914
Sure thing. The last couple of miles
are always the hardest.

971
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:02,854
It'll go fast for you.

972
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,878
Do you think they'll come?

973
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:28,849
If they do, they'll think they've run
right into the middle of Custer's last stand.

974
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:37,791
What are you carrying the hardware for?
They'd have crossed the border by now.

975
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:41,856
You better stay inside.

976
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,921
There's liable
to be some lead flying tonight.

977
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:46,229
Go on, all right. Don't worry.

978
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:00,114
- Who's there?
- It's Amos. Open the door.

979
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:03,573
Leave the door unlocked.

980
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,985
If he comes in, we'll make it easy for him
to get a belly full of lead.

981
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:09,455
Blackie, you watch the back door.

982
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,897
Stampede!

983
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,418
Bill!

984
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,888
Here's a gun, Steve.
I'm coming in the back way.

985
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,269
Get to that back door.

986
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,707
Drop that shotgun, Blackie.

987
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:24,550
Don't believe me?

988
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:37,762
Let's get out of here.

989
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,431
Open that door, I'll blast you.

990
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,865
Come in, Cheyenne.

991
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:51,874
All right, open it.

992
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:56,443
Where do we go from here?

993
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,383
After Clanton. You want him and Lester.

994
01:20:58,453 --> 01:20:59,545
Clanton? You sure?

995
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,248
Yeah, Lester told me last night.

996
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,454
Think what we can do with $80,000.

997
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:08,053
I'm beginning to understand. I wouldn't
walk around the corner with you...

998
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:09,892
you murdering crook.

999
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:13,130
I didn't think you were
such a sentimental fool, Countess...

1000
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,066
like the rest of the yokels in this town.

1001
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,832
- You can't get away with this.
- Can't I?

1002
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,668
I've heard about rats
deserting sinking ships...

1003
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,212
but this is the first time I ever seen one.

1004
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,770
Get out of my way, Uncle Willie.

1005
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:29,578
You got me scared, but not for $80,000.

1006
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,479
Get out of my way.

1007
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:32,979
Let go.

1008
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,579
- Quit.
- Just let loose of my arm. Let go!

1009
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,594
- Let go, I tell you.
- No, I won't.

1010
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,040
No, please, Mr. Lester. Don't come in!

1011
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,705
- Get out of the way. Get back there.
- Put up your guns.

1012
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,739
Put up your guns. No shooting.
Please, Mr. Lester, it's all new glassware.

1013
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,513
- Shut up.
- Drinks on the house.

1014
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:09,619
There she goes again.

1015
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,452
Duck! Get out of the way, will you?

1016
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:22,453
Hit the floor!

1017
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,714
Watch out, Cheyenne.

1018
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,340
Friendship.

1019
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:17,808
There they are!

1020
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:25,385
We'll have a couple of legal hangings
right here and now.

1021
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,394
- Get them, boys!
- Wait a minute.

1022
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:28,827
Nobody's going to be hanged.

1023
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,024
The men that should've been
are beyond that now.

1024
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,294
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't listen to him.

1025
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,858
Get them while you got a chance.

1026
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:36,403
Take it easy.

1027
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,636
Especially you, Judge.

1028
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:40,435
That's better.

1029
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:45,070
Cheyenne's got a little story he's gonna tell,
and I want you to listen real careful.

1030
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:56,689
Boys, I just caught Stanley Clanton lighting
out of town with the money from the bank.

1031
01:24:57,192 --> 01:25:00,525
I had to shoot him, and before he died,
he confessed.

1032
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:04,326
He was in cahoots with Jack Lester
and robbing his own bank.

1033
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,398
Here's all your money.

1034
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:12,372
Do you, Bill Smith...

1035
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,532
take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1036
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,702
I do.

1037
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,277
And do you, Allison McLeod...

1038
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:20,644
take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1039
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:21,841
I do.

1040
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:23,574
I pronounce you man and wife.

1041
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,950
What God has joined together
let no man put asunder.

1042
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,856
Well, go ahead and kiss her.
Give her a little smack.

1043
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,388
Dad.

1044
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:41,968
- Mrs. Smith, best of luck to you.
- Thank you.

1045
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,170
Well, wasn't it worth it, Willie?

1046
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,398
Sure. I'm glad I confessed.

1047
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:52,104
How was Bill gonna get a fresh start,
or Allison be made happy...

1048
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,875
if I didn't clear the whole thing up?

1049
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:56,508
And you ain't gonna be ashamed
of that honesty, Willie.

1050
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:59,985
No, sir. Why, you're gonna get a quick,
fair, legal trial...

1051
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:02,488
and not a day more than 20 years.

1052
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,991
That's mighty fine of you, Judge.

1053
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,652
What?
