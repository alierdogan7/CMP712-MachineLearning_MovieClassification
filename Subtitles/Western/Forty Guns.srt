2
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,801
Where can you swim?

3
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,396
Barney,
on the other side of the street.

4
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,322
I agree with you.

5
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:46,401
Let me, Brockie!

6
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,245
I do not want to kill you!

7
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,162
What is the matter?

8
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:53,437
Since when are you aiming at the back?

9
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:55,882
Griff? ... Is that you?

10
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,525
You promised
to wear glasses!

11
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:03,646
If we pray long enough
there's something going on.

12
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,764
It is not prayer
scares you.

13
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,401
That bother you?

14
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,764
A greenhorn,
really bad.

15
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,326
He was drunk ...

16
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:13,920
Did he tell you damn scared, huh?

17
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,282
He gave me one hour
to leave the city.

18
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:17,516
So go away!

19
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:19,001
Help me!

20
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,919
I'm not here
to spank a kid.

21
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,124
If he draws the first
I'm lost.

22
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:26,278
Your view is even worse,
is not it?

23
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:32,041
I'm broke.
I am forced to keep my job.

24
00:05:32,647 --> 00:05:35,115
We have a profession.

25
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:38,006
What can we do?

26
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,600
He has a good eye doctor in Prescott.

27
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,235
I can not run away like that!

28
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:43,999
You have no choice.

29
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,886
You must be a reason
not to help me.

30
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,641
- It does not concern me.
- So what are you doing here?

31
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,960
Flee before being blind!

32
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,198
And if the doctor can do nothing?

33
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,562
Thou shalt be blind
instead of being dead!

34
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,397
She is a woman who rides,

35
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,759
armed with a whip.

36
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:25,446
A woman that all men

37
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,160
wish.

38
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,846
But no man

39
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,006
can not tame.

40
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:35,565
It is called

41
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:39,999
Women with a whisk.

42
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,158
It controls

43
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,358
and men obey ...

44
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:52,482
They are only puppets

45
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,603
in his hands.

46
00:06:55,767 --> 00:07:00,522
When she rides,
the wind in your hair,

47
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:07,197
her eyes are full of fire.

48
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:12,524
But if anyone can tame,

49
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,806
and snatch the whip

50
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,084
a tall man, a hard man,

51
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,716
a strong man

52
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:27,596
we can see
Woman with the Whip

53
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:33,919
is a woman after all.

54
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:37,560
Put it, Barney!

55
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:41,122
It's you, Wes?

56
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,960
How are you, Barney?

57
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,562
I make lots of money
in this city!

58
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,042
You see, Griff!

59
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,960
My brother, Chico, California will.

60
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,842
With the opportunities that there are here?

61
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,321
Our family is there.

62
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,167
I saw the name
on the warrant.

63
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,204
You can not stop Swain.

64
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:00,643
Where can I find it?

65
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:01,836
The Dragons.

66
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:05,244
We saw a woman
and riders.

67
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,445
You've seen Jessica Drummond.

68
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:10,480
The song I just sing
was on it.

69
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:12,683
To Dragons
it is forbidden to sing it.

70
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:13,802
She, Drummond!

71
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,602
It controls the Cochise County.

72
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,598
She and her 40 riders.

73
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,525
A beautiful woman ...

74
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:22,405
Swain is one of his 40 thieves?

75
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:23,363
Yes.

76
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:32,165
Hello, Sheriff.

77
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:34,556
Going somewhere?

78
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,160
I stroll.

79
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,801
Chisholm!

80
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:52,886
Where are you?

81
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:56,605
You get the hell?

82
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:03,880
Give me your coffee.

83
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:17,326
Was scared, Sheriff?

84
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,637
Brockie, you're crazy!

85
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:24,646
You talk instead of fight!

86
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,281
No one here, do
to stop this ...

87
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:47,803
What a great sheriff!

88
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,842
Come on, Charlie, we'll have fun!

89
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:37,280
- How is it doctor?
- He will live but will be blind.

90
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:40,758
Why did not you listen?

91
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:42,042
I've heard.

92
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:43,879
You want a revolver, Griff?

93
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,238
No ... This is not my business!

94
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,126
I'll stop it!

95
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,159
I will not let
demolished my shop!

96
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,405
He can not fight!

97
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:01,686
Mr. gunsmith.

98
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:10,282
Where is your shop?

99
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,802
I'll show you, Mr Bonell.

100
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,240
Let's break the shop!

101
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:16,522
Which one?

102
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:19,717
It's.

103
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:29,640
Give me a gun.

104
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,036
What do you want?

105
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:58,922
I draw.

106
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,118
You are ill, Charlie?

107
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,755
One type works like that.

108
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,966
If approached, I guts!

109
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:10,435
What do you have?

110
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:25,075
Pull up!
I warn you!

111
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,042
Pull up!

112
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:43,284
Thank you, Mr. Spanger.

113
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,518
Here for the ball.

114
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,882
It will be 75 cents
to clean the gun.

115
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:56,246
You should review this rifle.

116
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,006
My almost killed him.

117
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:09,236
It is very well
in overalls.

118
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,405
Built like a 40-40.

119
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,035
I would stay long enough ...

120
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:20,959
Farmer you see me? Me?

121
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:22,606
I got the teeth
of a gun.

122
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,485
Baby teeth!

123
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,964
Remember what Dad said!

124
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,687
"Workers of the earth
are the Chosen of God. "

125
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,645
I do not want to be "chosen".
I will be the third gun Griff.

126
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,877
Let me show it!

127
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,317
You never made duel.

128
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,715
You, you ever afraid?

129
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,240
Always.

130
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:43,245
Here's your ticket.
Do not lose it.

131
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,356
I read that there was plenty
attacks on stagecoaches.

132
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,564
3 or 4 a week
all passengers killed.

133
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,524
They do not kill women
and youngsters!

134
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:53,359
Be careful what you say.

135
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:54,403
Excuse me, gentlemen,

136
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,603
which of you is Bonell Griff?

137
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:57,722
Can I help you?

138
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:02,165
I'm Ned Logan,
Sheriff of Cochise County.

139
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:04,765
It is you, Wes?

140
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,796
Sorry
whether they are worthless

141
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,123
you have received in the city.

142
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,402
You stay?

143
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:13,682
Long enough.

144
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,806
Brockie is a spoiled child.
This correction had to sober up.

145
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,286
It's yours now.

146
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:20,766
I do not want him.

147
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:24,237
Thank you for having put in prison.

148
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:27,958
I was not there
Chisholm to help ...

149
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:30,442
I had to go across the border.

150
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,486
With all of your assistants?

151
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:34,559
Well, I'm Sheriff

152
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,003
collector and at the same time.

153
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,964
I need help.

154
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:43,280
The cowboys lie
their herds.

155
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,036
It's hard to avoid the Apaches

156
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,721
and file input acts

157
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:55,562
on ranches, mines,
sawmills.

158
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,520
You are in an official capacity?

159
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:00,247
You must be very busy.

160
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,637
You will explore
in the hills?

161
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,798
No, I'll send a telegram.

162
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,246
It's here.

163
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,920
Tex will look after you.

164
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,796
A friend of mine wants to send
one message.

165
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:16,676
I saw you wander the city.

166
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:19,600
Even more slowly
at Dodge City.

167
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:23,645
A Bonell Nicholas ...

168
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:26,998
I knew
a Captain Niki Bonell

169
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,123
47 in Mexico.

170
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:32,200
He was wounded in the leg.

171
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,363
There was 34 years ago.

172
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:35,482
It was my father.

173
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:36,602
His leg is getting better?

174
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,917
The cable will do him good.

175
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:43,605
"All in good health"

176
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,962
"Chico from Saturday"

177
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:49,005
"Write after finishing
business here "

178
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,317
"Signed! Griff and Wes"

179
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,957
M. Bonell,
I am at your disposal.

180
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,715
It has a small bump.

181
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:35,679
Where is he
that attacked my brother?

182
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,441
Why is it free?

183
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:39,563
You know who he is ...

184
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:42,958
Perfectly. Killer legal!

185
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:45,721
I'm surprised
he attack my child.

186
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,799
It was large enough
to shoot a blind!

187
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,764
What is he accused?

188
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,076
Of disorder!

189
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:55,646
Disorder?

190
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:57,206
He shot a defenseless man.

191
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,356
You saw?

192
00:18:58,527 --> 00:19:00,040
No, but everyone knows it.

193
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,641
The meeting was called.

194
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,561
This discussion
was personal.

195
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:10,242
19 witnesses testified
self-defense.

196
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:12,404
You are guilty of disorder.

197
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:13,761
$ 50 fine.

198
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:17,476
Release the prisoner.
Give him his weapons.

199
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:52,006
He left us alone,
he was blind!

200
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,840
Why did you shoot?
Because of the girl?

201
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:56,641
What are you talking about?

202
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,720
They come complaining to me!

203
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,400
I'm tired of paying for you.

204
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:03,006
She came to see me.

205
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:06,398
You have so many friends.

206
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:07,920
Give me your revolvers.

207
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,358
It is necessary that I enjoy!

208
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:12,165
If you can not mount

209
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,680
you do not need a horse.

210
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:15,246
Your guns!

211
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:02,681
Why did you go whining
my sister, too?

212
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:06,087
I do not like the others!

213
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:08,280
Run home ...

214
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:10,326
You are very similar to others!

215
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:14,518
Who would I went to Brock?

216
00:21:15,327 --> 00:21:17,283
You know I'm alone.

217
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,523
You refused to see me.

218
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,082
He has had.

219
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:26,400
You know what you gonna do?

220
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,126
Tell my sister
I've never touched.

221
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:34,360
No, I'm not going to lie.

222
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:37,203
It was good to me.

223
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:39,798
She gave me money.

224
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,197
She said she would help me.

225
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,722
Tell him that you lied!

226
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:53,600
I should throw you down.

227
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,325
Do it and you'll cut your food.

228
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:56,715
If Jessica was not your sister ...

229
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:58,918
You do not get,
you are too weak.

230
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:01,237
You do not have enough guts
for her.

231
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,246
I could kill you

232
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,438
for the harm you do him.

233
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,518
Stop messing with the girls!

234
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:10,724
You could be someone
with the help of Jessica.

235
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:12,600
We pay $ 300 Chisholm.

236
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:16,203
For the name of Bonell,
we will go to 500.

237
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:20,121
For the size,
it takes between 5 / 8 and 11/16.

238
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,158
There are jobs worse than sheriff.

239
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:27,125
Height of arch, between 1 and 1.58.

240
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:31,523
It is time
as you settle, Wes.

241
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:34,124
This is a good wood for the butt.

242
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:36,084
This is not what you need.

243
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:40,480
Give me the hazel, Dad.

244
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:42,326
One?

245
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,961
This is the 1st time
that makes me a gun to measure.

246
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,881
You have the shoulders down.

247
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:58,479
It complicates your work?

248
00:22:58,647 --> 00:23:00,285
I can get.

249
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,995
How long,
for this rifle?

250
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,515
Lot of time.

251
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:07,723
A fitting day.

252
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:13,082
It's time I settle down.

253
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,921
But this city
resembles other.

254
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:19,596
A gun Spanger
resembles other

255
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:21,685
unless one knows.

256
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,958
That's a good job.

257
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:26,999
I've never seen anything better.

258
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:30,477
For a gun like that,
it's worth it to stay.

259
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:38,882
I had never kissed
gunsmith.

260
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,199
Step back?

261
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:32,076
I have a mandate
for one of your men.

262
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:35,757
Could you do without?

263
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,239
The Governor is he aware?

264
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:12,484
He has not heard of.

265
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,245
This mandate is not here.

266
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:17,841
Is it legal?

267
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,156
Certainly.

268
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:22,086
It comes straight from Washington.

269
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:25,522
Mr. Logan, you are challenged.

270
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,803
A deputy is accused
theft of mail.

271
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:31,762
I'm sure he will go
the authority of the Government.

272
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,277
What do you mean?

273
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,595
Are you the assistant Swain?

274
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:41,720
You know what I mean.

275
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:44,956
You heard Mr. Bonell.
Follow him.

276
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,795
One moment, please.

277
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:14,959
You are not afraid
an ambush?

278
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,926
I am always afraid of losing
what is the state.

279
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,517
It is not
I have heard you.

280
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,638
And what I heard
you!

281
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:27,038
What have you heard about?

282
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,524
We apologize, gentlemen.

283
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,682
Whisky is in service.

284
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,922
My reputation will suffer

285
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:43,246
the deputy sheriff
flying the mail!

286
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:45,159
I have already decided on Governor

287
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:46,237
horse thief.

288
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,681
Remember this.

289
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:49,041
I have many more.

290
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:50,840
For my guests?

291
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,123
There are other
who stole the mail?

292
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:56,721
What do you want?

293
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:59,841
Logan wearing the badge
but he is afraid.

294
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:04,285
This job pays well,
there are commissions, etc..

295
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,921
We can get rich on the "etc"?

296
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:08,281
You offer me this job?

297
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:10,324
You would be elected immediately.

298
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:12,398
- With your help?
- With or without.

299
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,439
You are a killer hot!

300
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:17,756
This work is not size
for me.

301
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,918
It would be the size you want.

302
00:28:20,687 --> 00:28:22,678
You do not care, Mr Bonell.

303
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,721
This is your brand ...
Can I touch it?

304
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:29,880
Just curious.

305
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:31,879
It can blow in the face.

306
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:33,605
I take the risk.

307
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,724
You almost break his head.

308
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:45,645
I could if I wanted.

309
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:49,679
Fortunately,
you were not paid for the kill.

310
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,040
I do not kill for money.

311
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:55,882
I'm sure it is not
for fun.

312
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,158
I'm sure you are safe.

313
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,880
You asked for whiskey.

314
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:16,441
Whiskey is good, Logan.
Try it!

315
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:49,280
Put him in jail, Wes.
See you at the hotel.

316
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:06,242
I have been uncomfortable
to leave the party

317
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,844
but, as a sheriff,
my place was here.

318
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,759
Of course, Sheriff.

319
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:15,919
Give the prisoner what he wants
account of Uncle Sam

320
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:20,602
Swain, I do not believe.
Honestly ...

321
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:22,679
A man like you

322
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:26,838
well paid, that flies in the mail!

323
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,604
You must be a little disturbed.

324
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:39,725
How long ...

325
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,644
this idiot will it stay here?

326
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:47,445
2 or 3 days, Sheriff.

327
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:02,917
Save money from the state.
Hang him now!

328
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:05,760
I would like,
but it is outside my field.

329
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:10,007
He acted alone?

330
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:12,877
I know how you feel.

331
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:15,607
It's a shame
for all other sheriffs.

332
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,246
It's true.

333
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,965
So much for the back
the Chief Justice.

334
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,077
We must all read and sign.

335
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:29,163
The whole. It's the rule.

336
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:33,560
I will take it later
with the prisoner.

337
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:27,202
Where is Chico?

338
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:28,880
He went for a drink.

339
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,242
He never drank in his life!

340
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,999
Griff Bonell's up there?

341
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:36,884
We have your brother Chico.
Where should I put the body?

342
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:42,964
1st Division.
We came here to have fun.

343
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,924
Your brother drank the whiskey.

344
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:46,520
And he demolished the house!

345
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:48,643
Help me, Barney.

346
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:11,079
I understand that Brock.
He was born coward and violent.

347
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:14,796
- But you, Chico!
- I am old enough to drink.

348
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:16,764
But you do not want alcohol.

349
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,160
- It will come!
- Why?

350
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:21,646
That's my business!

351
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,605
What's wrong?

352
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,965
Why did I come with you?
For me wandering?

353
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,046
You set this matter

354
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,199
without letting me help you.

355
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:42,163
And if something happened to Wes?

356
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,999
You never work without
covered by a second fuses /.

357
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:51,004
You did not let me help you
either the Dragons.

358
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:52,965
I feel too.

359
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,086
Do I hurt you?

360
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:01,402
I will never be a farmer,
Griff.

361
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:03,200
I'm not interested.

362
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:08,925
You taught me to shoot.

363
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:11,240
You have learned all too well.

364
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:15,879
You know what happened
Chisholm?

365
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,723
It could happen and happen to me.

366
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:24,764
You remember the gladiators
Roman I told you about?

367
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,997
You thought it was funny.

368
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:30,959
Soon people will laugh
men like me.

369
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,878
In several cities
we went

370
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:36,845
I know they looked at me
as a phenomenon of the past.

371
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:40,122
This is a new era
started it.

372
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:42,477
My way of life
is already exceeded.

373
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,480
You talk too much for justice.

374
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:47,160
I am one phenomenon, Chico.

375
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:52,038
I do not want
that thou mayest be one too.

376
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,398
I'm tired of passing
for a youngster.

377
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:57,515
I do not
for agriculture!

378
00:34:58,447 --> 00:34:59,357
I know.

379
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:15,397
Brand new! A Colt 45!

380
00:35:16,527 --> 00:35:20,918
Nickel! With an ivory butt!
For me?

381
00:35:21,847 --> 00:35:25,681
To kill rattlesnakes,
on the farm.

382
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:27,965
Tell him that from me.

383
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:29,999
I do not care about money!

384
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:33,000
I will not be a target!

385
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:36,603
There is no boundary
Bonell for Griff!

386
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:40,362
He will find me wherever I go!

387
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:44,076
Listen, Swain.
You know she has influence.

388
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:46,966
She will use it when necessary.

389
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:48,685
It will be too late!

390
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:51,522
I want out now
and legally!

391
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:54,838
I want tomorrow
always be 1 assistant.

392
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:56,918
It can do this.
It is the Patron.

393
00:35:57,087 --> 00:36:01,365
Otherwise ... I know all about her.

394
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:08,119
You want me to tell him that?

395
00:36:17,687 --> 00:36:18,324
Are you sure?

396
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:19,556
Some.

397
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:42,522
Who shot you?
You saw?

398
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:47,278
Tell me. I am your friend.

399
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:50,644
If you have seen,
we will take care of him.

400
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,999
I can not move his legs.

401
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:56,316
Rest in peace.

402
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:58,961
I think he knows who shot.

403
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,679
He tries to speak.

404
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:04,238
Did you see that shot?

405
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,921
If you saw, you must tell us.

406
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:10,400
We will find the one that did it.

407
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:20,835
Does he tell you
something?

408
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:22,998
He told you who it was?

409
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,886
Remove the ball Wes.
He died.

410
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:57,238
Have you ever seen the ball?

411
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:04,798
She comes from a new rifle
Sharps-Bourchardt.

412
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:06,680
There are here?

413
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,281
Only one man has one.

414
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:10,517
Who is it?

415
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,564
Howard Swain fire.

416
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:15,795
We just take that ball
of her back.

417
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:18,435
He had to be killed
with his own gun.

418
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,356
Who is the best killer
of the state?

419
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:24,515
I did not kill him.

420
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:27,645
No, after you, that makes the best?

421
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:31,366
Charlie Savage.

422
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:34,326
You are in full panic!

423
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:38,043
I had to go fast. Charlie Savage
is the best shooter.

424
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:39,560
You have decided for me?

425
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:41,046
Sometimes a partner ...

426
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:42,959
I am the boss,
not a partner.

427
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:45,482
I did not
you take it as that.

428
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:47,126
How Griff Bonell
will take it there?

429
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:49,847
Do not worry, everything is arranged.

430
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:51,838
It's over for you.

431
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,157
It was you who
Swain killed, not me.

432
00:38:54,327 --> 00:38:56,045
I had no choice.

433
00:38:57,007 --> 00:38:58,918
You have passed the rope
the neck.

434
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:03,166
Go!

435
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,717
Go, like a dog
tails between their legs!

436
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:10,200
Take your killers and fly ...
now!

437
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:36,758
You must feel naked
without your army.

438
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:40,203
What name on your list
today?

439
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:42,244
One of your riders, Charlie Savage.

440
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:45,237
It has damaged that belonged
the Government.

441
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:47,125
I do not monitor my men

442
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:50,245
I am not responsible
of what they do far away.

443
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:52,518
There must be many
shelters here.

444
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,200
I show them to be happy.

445
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:58,007
I want to see if you find it
on my land.

446
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:00,080
You want to spank him?

447
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,597
I want to see
if you can take it.

448
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:10,525
This is a good cache.

449
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:51,805
A snake bit me IA
when I was 15.

450
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:55,800
I bet he died.

451
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:59,204
Well, you do not have much
esteem for me?

452
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:00,561
On the contrary.

453
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:03,844
It will be hard if your brother
is in the game.

454
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,360
Murder is not in his blood.

455
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:07,757
He is your brother, right?

456
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,596
You seem unhappy.

457
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,041
I was born like that.

458
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:00,196
Up to 8 years

459
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,165
I thought all that had
Four legs of cattle was

460
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,716
and all that had two, a man.

461
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,959
At 9 years, I learned the difference.

462
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,715
Not between cattle and humans

463
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,038
but between race and the rest.

464
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:17,162
At 10, I scored the calves,

465
00:45:17,567 --> 00:45:19,239
matais horses

466
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:21,722
I was riding,
I slept on the floor.

467
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:26,201
My father was absent
when Brockie was born.

468
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:29,487
I was alone with my mother.
I was 12.

469
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,365
He was born in this cabin.

470
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:35,398
My mother died
by keeping the world.

471
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:38,045
I buried her.

472
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:40,517
I went to get milk
for Brockie.

473
00:45:41,047 --> 00:45:42,036
He was able to live.

474
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:48,004
At 15, a guy tried
bothering me right here.

475
00:45:50,727 --> 00:45:52,957
My father knew poorly drawn.

476
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,641
He was killed while trying
to protect me.

477
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:04,325
You're fired?

478
00:46:07,087 --> 00:46:09,840
My father built
the cabin of his hands.

479
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:12,923
You kept
in memory of him?

480
00:46:16,247 --> 00:46:18,761
In memory of the past.

481
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:23,006
At 18,
I had my flock to me.

482
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:26,955
I found Logan, I hired him.

483
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,795
I became interested
in politics.

484
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:33,401
I spent well
of this country.

485
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:37,676
I funded mine
sawmills.

486
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:38,962
You've come a long way!

487
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:40,242
You too.

488
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:43,238
My men talk a lot
you.

489
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:47,403
Have they said my trouble
with them?

490
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:49,963
Those who are still alive, yes.

491
00:46:51,447 --> 00:46:53,597
You have advanced
with a revolver.

492
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:57,403
You are at the point.

493
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:00,044
The border is finished.

494
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:04,119
There are more cities,
more men, to be submitted.

495
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:08,043
It is time for you to stop.

496
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,920
Other building peace
on graves!

497
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:19,201
Your life can not be made
that of fire!

498
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,801
Direct the Dragons for me.

499
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,122
Come work with me.

500
00:47:27,967 --> 00:47:29,116
Me and my revolver?

501
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:32,324
It's time to throw.
He will one day.

502
00:47:32,647 --> 00:47:34,126
I give you the opportunity.

503
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:35,561
Why me?

504
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:39,639
I need a strong man
to transmit my orders.

505
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:42,004
And a weak
to accept them.

506
00:47:43,887 --> 00:47:46,401
My throat is dry.
I talk too much.

507
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,562
What do you want?

508
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:02,527
She does not see you
bring these guns!

509
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:04,879
You do not give more orders
for her.

510
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:09,086
I want to see Bonell kill you
but she wants me.

511
00:48:09,247 --> 00:48:10,646
I'll be the one who will kill!

512
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:14,766
Nobody wants to kill him
but we must cope.

513
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:17,122
It will be like before.
Give them to me!

514
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:19,642
I did that once given ...
to it!

515
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:22,002
This is the case of Charlie Savage.

516
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,761
If we were in on it,
it would be too.

517
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:26,326
Give me your revolvers.

518
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:30,406
Go to the other side and wait for me.

519
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:32,200
That will bring Bonell Griff?

520
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,039
Wiley. Now, get out of there.

521
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:57,206
It does not please me, Sheriff.

522
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:00,006
There is nothing to fear.

523
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:05,605
Wes will forward
as usual

524
00:49:06,127 --> 00:49:09,278
with a gun,
to see the situation.

525
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,836
Then he will move somewhere

526
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:13,918
Griff back to cover.

527
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:18,438
So Griff arrives.

528
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,325
It will stop here.

529
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:22,922
He paid attention.

530
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:27,637
Do not worry about anything.

531
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:31,243
You'll be there ... the corner.

532
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:33,204
He can not see you.

533
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:38,518
Griff will cry! "Charlie Savage."

534
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,325
You say! "Yes ...?"

535
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:43,206
He will cry that he has a mandate.

536
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:45,642
You say!
"Come get me!"

537
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:48,002
He will say! "Okay!"

538
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:50,276
Listen!

539
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:58,160
Griff will be that way.

540
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,677
He will see that I'm not Savage.

541
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:07,199
It will be dead.

542
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:16,997
So what?

543
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:19,761
Nothing, no one has seen or in Phoenix
or Prescott.

544
00:50:20,087 --> 00:50:21,566
And Tucson?

545
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,877
We think it went to Mexico.

546
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,243
I was looking for.
Savage is in town.

547
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:32,238
He is waiting for a duel.

548
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:34,480
Across from the dealer.

549
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:35,966
Who told you that he was waiting for me?

550
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:39,597
Savage himself.
It does not seem to be afraid.

551
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:41,476
Go for it!

552
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:43,717
Can I help you?

553
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:46,003
I'll call you
If I need you.

554
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,839
Okay, do not forget me ...

555
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:54,360
Good. Let's go.

556
00:50:55,087 --> 00:50:59,239
Expect more
that Chico is gone.

557
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:09,883
Barney was looking for you.
What is the matter?

558
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:11,036
No.

559
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:12,921
Monte.

560
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:21,965
Thou shalt maybe 2 days
to know where he is.

561
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,280
Maybe even a week!

562
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:27,045
I can not stay so far?

563
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:33,922
Tell the parents
that we will come soon.

564
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:35,799
In a few weeks maybe.

565
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:37,963
Say I have a surprise for them.

566
00:51:44,127 --> 00:51:46,516
He could have
a good third gun.

567
00:51:48,927 --> 00:51:50,758
What's the surprise?

568
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,600
I'm getting married.

569
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:55,956
Few women know
make a gun.

570
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:00,763
You stay here?

571
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,362
Yes.

572
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:05,445
I will be sheriff.

573
00:52:05,807 --> 00:52:06,956
The pay is good?

574
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:09,317
Better than the Government.

575
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,287
The name of Bonell
they want.

576
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:18,363
When you have made Savage,
you will have a second gun.

577
00:52:18,527 --> 00:52:19,642
It's true.

578
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:53,919
I have a warrant for you.

579
00:53:55,687 --> 00:53:58,201
Throw down your weapon.
Get out, hands raised.

580
00:54:06,207 --> 00:54:07,162
Do you hear me?

581
00:54:11,429 --> 00:54:12,544
Get out of here!

582
00:54:23,749 --> 00:54:24,864
Come and get me!

583
00:54:31,149 --> 00:54:32,548
CHORUS FREE
FOR BURIALS

584
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:40,987
You could do without me!

585
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:42,708
He thee in plain view.

586
00:54:43,189 --> 00:54:43,826
Who is it?

587
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:56,905
Barney said he was here.

588
00:54:57,229 --> 00:54:59,345
I jumped out of the diligence.

589
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:01,298
I got it in the head.

590
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:02,738
All of a sudden!

591
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:04,827
I, a farmer!

592
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:10,217
What have I done?

593
00:55:11,029 --> 00:55:12,018
You killed a man!

594
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:36,543
Assassins!

595
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:37,904
Calm down, boys!

596
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,388
I will destroy!

597
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:42,783
No fighting personal

598
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:45,099
now that you're
my second gun.

599
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:46,304
Got it?

600
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:06,905
They are beautifully arranged here!

601
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,905
The last man I killed,

602
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:16,098
he was a young.

603
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:18,588
As your brother.

604
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,386
He was very young and I killed him.

605
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:24,662
I could only hurt him.
I did not.

606
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:28,102
Have you ever seen eyes
death of a boy?

607
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:32,065
The shooter safest in the West.

608
00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:38,505
I hate to fight.
I never miss.

609
00:56:38,669 --> 00:56:40,022
I talk too much?

610
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:45,467
I apologize if I kill

611
00:56:45,629 --> 00:56:47,904
even an animal.

612
00:56:49,189 --> 00:56:52,022
You can not ask later.
It's too late.

613
00:56:54,389 --> 00:56:57,142
But I came
Brockie to talk about.

614
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:03,301
He put the body of Savage
in a display case.

615
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:07,466
Someone who does that
is practically dead.

616
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:09,903
But there is still time.

617
00:57:10,989 --> 00:57:13,378
You think it was
in the ambush?

618
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:16,906
I do not know what to think.

619
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,665
Wes my brother is getting married.
I go after the ceremony.

620
00:57:22,229 --> 00:57:24,265
That's why I came.

621
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:29,497
I know you like it
as a son.

622
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:32,058
I know.
I have a brother the same age.

623
00:57:33,469 --> 00:57:35,824
Spy on your own
before having to bury him.

624
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:45,704
I had to kill him.
Was the only way.

625
00:58:00,629 --> 00:58:02,062
Why did you not kill?

626
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,060
It took you for my brother.

627
00:58:05,189 --> 00:58:08,226
Nobody wants to be involved
a murder?

628
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:11,222
Swain and Savage died.

629
00:58:11,469 --> 00:58:14,825
The Government lets you down.

630
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:16,786
Everyone leaves the ship.

631
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:19,941
Captain dark.
It's the end of the Dragons.

632
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:22,498
He is our enemy.

633
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,058
That's why I wanted to kill him.

634
00:58:25,229 --> 00:58:27,618
To find your job?
Are you crazy?

635
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:31,618
My job!

636
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:39,098
Why do I lied, stole, cheated?

637
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:41,624
For my job? For money?

638
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:45,827
I am a man.

639
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:48,146
I have feelings.

640
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:51,423
You can not buy
what I feel.

641
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:54,862
I can not always
keep this hidden.

642
00:58:55,429 --> 00:58:59,627
I thought, patience, remember yourself.

643
00:58:59,949 --> 00:59:01,428
She will understand.

644
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:05,027
But I can not wait
all this time.

645
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:09,658
I must do something.

646
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:12,979
Let my heart speak.

647
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:17,465
What do you do with him?

648
00:59:19,549 --> 00:59:20,504
No.

649
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:36,941
I do not pay like the others.

650
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:57,822
I'm sorry.

651
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:24,102
You know why
he wanted to kill you.

652
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,660
He knows that I love you.

653
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:31,384
It's true,
Dragons collapse.

654
01:00:31,549 --> 01:00:34,666
But I do not care. I could
save them, I do not want.

655
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:38,066
I know how he feels.

656
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:42,027
The same
I feel for you.

657
01:00:44,149 --> 01:00:45,628
We can not forget

658
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:47,427
he and the rest.

659
01:00:48,989 --> 01:00:52,504
The boy you killed,
the life I led, all that.

660
01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:55,905
Do not leave without me.

661
01:01:00,229 --> 01:01:02,789
This happened to us
is like the war

662
01:01:03,989 --> 01:01:05,707
Easy to start

663
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:07,948
difficult to stop.

664
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:13,738
I have never known friendship
before love.

665
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:19,179
And I have a friendship for you,
Griff.

666
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,742
- What is it?
- Nothing.

667
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:44,788
Let's see.

668
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:33,337
I want the bells ring.

669
01:02:33,509 --> 01:02:35,943
Do not worry.
They will ring.

670
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:38,869
And you, do good work!

671
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:42,624
First time I wash my
for a wedding photo.

672
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:44,860
You have a lot of rice?

673
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:47,224
All we could find.

674
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:39,460
You do not embrace the bride?

675
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:31,948
It's all your fault.

676
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:35,185
If you had not embraced
the bride

677
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:36,702
my ball is in your head.

678
01:07:36,869 --> 01:07:38,666
I will do anything for him to live.

679
01:08:04,269 --> 01:08:05,861
The Government will be fair.

680
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:09,180
As you cooperate,
he gave up the charge.

681
01:08:10,269 --> 01:08:12,464
I am your advocate
and I repeat

682
01:08:12,629 --> 01:08:14,824
you did not give them so much.

683
01:08:14,989 --> 01:08:17,059
Half would have sufficed.

684
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:21,178
Your project has amazed
the politicians.

685
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:25,942
You could keep the boss

686
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:27,424
if you want.

687
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:33,983
They know that you have kept
tax money

688
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:38,179
but the state received of you
2 times more than before.

689
01:08:40,429 --> 01:08:43,865
You know what to do?

690
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:45,781
They will take your land

691
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:48,703
your cattle, your home

692
01:08:49,549 --> 01:08:52,825
all you have built, everything.

693
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,469
Where were you? Bonell with?

694
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:28,304
You've got money
to beat you to me?

695
01:09:28,549 --> 01:09:29,823
The fight is over.

696
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:33,783
You've always bought people.
Get me out of here!

697
01:09:33,949 --> 01:09:36,099
I spent every penny.

698
01:09:36,269 --> 01:09:38,066
I could not buy
the judge and jury.

699
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:40,140
Am calling!
We can still win!

700
01:09:40,629 --> 01:09:41,982
We lost.

701
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:43,787
We! It's my neck!

702
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,705
I can not do anything more.

703
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:50,344
You killed a federal sheriff.

704
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:54,587
Without his brother,
you get me out.

705
01:09:55,869 --> 01:09:57,666
You must be hanged.

706
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:09,029
Come on, the state does not
you to be hanged here.

707
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:13,937
You're right.

708
01:10:16,309 --> 01:10:18,345
You got me out of the woods all my life.

709
01:10:19,389 --> 01:10:21,744
Forgiveness.
I accept the punishment.

710
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:30,140
Do not do that, Brockie.
Throw down your weapon.

711
01:10:39,269 --> 01:10:40,941
Throw down your weapon and raises his hands.

712
01:10:46,349 --> 01:10:47,702
What are you afraid of?

713
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:51,945
Get out!

714
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,017
What are you waiting for?

715
01:11:03,269 --> 01:11:04,418
Shoot it!

716
01:11:21,549 --> 01:11:22,982
He had!

717
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:35,977
A doctor! She will live.

718
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:25,149
What are you standing?
You heard the doctor ...

719
01:12:25,309 --> 01:12:26,378
I'm fine.

720
01:12:26,549 --> 01:12:28,744
Go back to your room.

721
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,740
I can not let you out.

722
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:32,661
Thank you, that's fine.

723
01:12:38,469 --> 01:12:41,541
Fortunately
it was Griff Bonell.

724
01:12:42,549 --> 01:12:44,983
He shot right where he wanted.

725
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:47,500
I know that, Mr. Spanger.

726
01:12:49,229 --> 01:12:52,221
I can not say or do

727
01:12:52,589 --> 01:12:54,705
which brings it to you.

728
01:12:57,669 --> 01:13:00,263
It's hard to forget
the man you love.

729
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:02,584
I know.

730
01:13:04,869 --> 01:13:07,622
You have a thing for you,
Ms. Bonell.

731
01:13:09,349 --> 01:13:10,577
The youth.

732
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:42,259
A woman rides

733
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:44,268
armed with a whip.

734
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:51,382
A woman
that all men desire.

735
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:56,745
But no one can tame.

736
01:13:57,429 --> 01:14:03,265
It's called the Whip Woman.

737
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:09,020
It controls

738
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:11,862
and men obey.

739
01:14:15,429 --> 01:14:17,738
This is not to bother you.
He loves this song.

740
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:20,746
You did not listen, Sheriff.

741
01:14:20,909 --> 01:14:22,308
I leave for you.

742
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:24,058
In California.

743
01:14:25,789 --> 01:14:27,507
Drummond and Jessica?

744
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:31,781
I want to talk about her.

745
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:38,585
You have done for her
what you would have done

746
01:14:39,069 --> 01:14:40,821
for anyone else.

747
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:42,542
You lost your head.

748
01:14:44,269 --> 01:14:46,066
You have not killed a policeman.

749
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:47,907
You have exploded!

750
01:14:48,189 --> 01:14:50,145
You did what you taught me
not to do.

751
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:55,380
You must love him for killing
his brother that way!

752
01:14:55,549 --> 01:14:57,505
You do not speak more as a youngster.

753
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,188
Then go see it!

754
01:15:00,269 --> 01:15:02,829
I want it.
But it will never me!

755
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:06,339
If she had killed you,
I would not have forgiven him.

756
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:09,387
You know why?
I'm not big enough.

757
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:13,262
It must be great to forgive.
