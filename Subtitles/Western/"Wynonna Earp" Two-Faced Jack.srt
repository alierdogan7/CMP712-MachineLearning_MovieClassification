00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,466
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

2
00:00:01,467 --> 00:00:04,655
- Bobo sent me. Name's Bethany.
- (growling)

3
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:08,537
We're gonna track down the last
of the Seven if it kills me. A spade.

4
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:10,481
- I'm Dr. Reggie.
- She died because

5
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:12,108
humans can't survive when their

6
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,762
- organs are removed.
- So what?

7
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:16,065
In the shape of a
spade, like on a deck of cards.

8
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:20,051
- I'm shutting your division down.
- I have something else.

9
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,886
- Never before documented.
- (gunshot)

10
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,255
Any idea why your
homestead was targeted?

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,525
We should at least get
some breakfast. Then we'll talk.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,962
Wynonna!

13
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,463
(old-timey music)

14
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,421
Devil's hell.

15
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:00,023
(rustling sound)

16
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:08,064
Plus an angel incarnate.

17
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,110
Waverly?

18
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:22,679
Doc?

19
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:31,688
No, no, you're OK. Hey,
lay back. Lay back.

20
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:34,424
- What happened?
- Deep breaths, Deputy Earp.

21
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,926
You remember me?

22
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,930
Uh... Dr. Ninja.

23
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:42,057
- Am I in the morgue?
- Thankfully, no.

24
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,433
You're in the hospital.

25
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,888
Do you remember
anything about the accident?

26
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:47,137
Accident?

27
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:50,473
I was at the homestead...

28
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,943
Zombie strippers.

29
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,046
Oh, OK. Some memory loss

30
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,148
is totally normal after such a trauma.

31
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,617
Where's Waverly? Where's
my sister? Where's Doc?

32
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,186
No, no, no. We have to
limit your visitors right now,

33
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,221
until...

34
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,190
Wynonna,

35
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,293
I need you to listen to me.

36
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:13,263
Why can't I move my legs?

37
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:15,231
There's no easy way to
say this. You suffered

38
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,792
severe damage to your spinal cord,

39
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:18,535
causing paralysis from the waist down.

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,737
(panting frantically)

Hold on, son, now
there's no need for hollering.

50
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,903
Wynonna and Officer
Haught, they've been taken.

51
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,605
- What do you mean, taken?
- Abducted,

52
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,121
absconded, whatever the hell
you want to call it, they're gone!

53
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:00,076
What do you mean, gone?

54
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:03,346
He's got them, Dolls. The Fiend himself.

55
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,687
You don't understand. I love my legs.

56
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,023
They're what I walk
on. What are you giving me?

57
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,792
- I feel so...
- You feel hungover?

58
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:19,129
You're very lucky, Ms. Earp.
Lucky you didn't kill anyone.

59
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:22,132
I wasn't drunk... anymore.

60
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:25,135
Ask... Nicole.

61
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,570
Nicole was driving. Where's Nicole?

62
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,439
Shh, I have to listen, OK?

63
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,374
(shivering)

64
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,679
So you're like, a full-on doctor?

65
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,714
Morgue duty is just
part of our rotation.

66
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:41,718
I thought I might go to med school.

67
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:45,255
My solid D-minus thought otherwise.

68
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,751
- Where'd you go?
- Queens Undergraduate,

69
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:50,527
Princeton Medical School.

70
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:53,029
And you chose to
practice here? In Purgatory?

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,467
- Lucky for me.
- Indeed. I am actually

72
00:03:57,502 --> 00:04:01,671
pioneering a radical new procedure
at this hospital.

73
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,751
To increase certain brain functions,

74
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,408
and I guess you could say...

75
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:09,112
shut down others. Certain
areas of emotion

76
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,681
cause a patient to be irrational.

77
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:13,616
They can be removed.

78
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,519
One question.

79
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:18,655
Do you only use the cane

80
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,357
as a weapon, or are you hiding
a limp under all that bullshit?

81
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,293
Excuse me?

82
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,129
Princeton doesn't have a
medical school, dickwad.

83
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:29,566
You're not a doctor, you're
a killer. A revenant.

84
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,838
People think that all it
takes to become a doctor is smarts.

85
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:36,473
No, no, no, no.

86
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,975
A real doctor pushes boundaries.

87
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,112
Does things that others
find distasteful for the sake

88
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:46,316
of progress. Take yourself, Wynonna.

89
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:49,953
You've been a very, very bad girl.

90
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:52,222
But it's not your fault, is it?

91
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:55,792
There's something very
wrong, deep inside of you.

92
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:57,827
And the doctor will search

93
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:00,697
until he finds it, and cut it

94
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:04,200
right out.

95
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,738
Off to prep an O.R.

96
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,707
Back in a jiff!

97
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:13,643
(whistling)

98
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:19,115
(gasping)

99
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,153
(woman): Hello?

100
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:32,662
Bethany?

101
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,670
I'll call the Feds and I'm gonna make a

102
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,434
discrete request for
additional resources.

103
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,102
- We need boots on the ground.
- No.

104
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,171
No, we need choppers in the air

105
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:43,940
and jets and drones and cruise missiles

106
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,658
- pointed right at Bobo's head!
- Wasn't Bobo that took 'em.

107
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,429
Wasn't the Stone Witch neither.

108
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,079
And your fancy weapons won't do anything

109
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,015
against Jack and his knives.

110
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,727
- What kind of man...
- To call him

111
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,451
a man would be to speak generously.

112
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,720
In Dodge City there was a schoolteacher

113
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,756
name of Sally. She laughed like a mule,

114
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,558
but her eyes did shine.

115
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,526
I was sweet on her,

116
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,728
but she went missing. Wyatt and me,

117
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,697
we tracked her to a limestone cave

118
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,567
in the hills. That's where we found her,

119
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:13,636
with three other soiled doves

120
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,039
that had been thought to have run off.

121
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:19,409
He had taken their insides out.

122
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,377
Spread them around their own bodies

123
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:23,643
- like a Thanksgiving feast.
- Oh my god.

124
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,814
Papers called him

125
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,666
'the Jack of Knives'
on account of the fact

126
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,510
that's what he called himself in the

127
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:30,154
letters he sent, taunting them.

128
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,789
Adept at all manner of blade.

129
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,081
- Great.
- Wyatt and me,

130
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,391
we made it our mission

131
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,627
to hunt him down. We tracked him

132
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:40,096
through the Cumberland
pass, nearly freezing to death,

133
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,998
and then I got sick.

134
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,133
Real sick.

135
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,604
Wyatt never spoke of
Jack again, but I know

136
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,590
he was the one that
haunted him the most.

137
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:53,643
Well, Wyatt must've got him eventually,
otherwise the creep

138
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,566
wouldn't be a revenant. He was a serial

139
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,313
killer when he was human. Who knows

140
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,603
what he's capable of now?

141
00:06:58,628 --> 00:06:59,983
Or what he's gonna do to Wynonna.

142
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:02,018
Or Officer Haught.

143
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:08,691
The spade.

144
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,093
The spade...

145
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,862
once symbolized a sword

146
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,664
- or unsheathed blade...
- Or knife.

147
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,532
He's the last of the Seven.

148
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:18,601
Come on.

149
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,157
Whoa, whoa, Waverly. Can't go anywhere

150
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:21,437
with that broken wing of yours.

151
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:22,954
Besides, I need you to
stay here and dig deep,

152
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,475
find more on this Jack, alright?

153
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,611
Right. Bring them home safe, OK?

154
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,547
Of course. Alright, Holliday,

155
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,395
you said you tracked this
guy before, right?

156
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,684
You think you can do it again?

157
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,886
You want my help? I figured...

158
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:38,697
That I'd keep you at arms' length?

159
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:40,523
Yeah, well, not this time, cowboy.

160
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:42,191
Come on. Saddle up.

161
00:07:46,197 --> 00:07:49,332
We've found her. Officer Haught.

162
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,734
Status?

163
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,803
She's alive. Barely.

164
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,172
Motorist spotted her on
the side of the highway.

165
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:58,843
- EMS had to resuscitate on site.
- Damn him.

166
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,811
- I'm gonna need access.
- You'll have it. Two conditions.

167
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,359
- Alright, name them.
- Doctor says

168
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:04,914
she needs a break, you hightail it.

169
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,694
And when you find the bastard who did

170
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,484
this, you make sure no one else does.

171
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,553
And you.

172
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:14,223
Move your damn horse.

173
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,193
- How long have you been here?
- Couple days.

174
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,529
- Maybe a week?
- You had any visitors?

175
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:22,765
- Seen any nurses, orderlies?
- Just Dr. Reggie.

176
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,233
He's gonna fix us.

177
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,869
OK, Bethany, we're in serious shit here.

178
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,739
It's OK to feel
nervous before a surgery.

179
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,241
This isn't a real hospital.

180
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:34,501
- Reggie's not a real doctor.
- He cares about me.

181
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:35,690
You know how long it's been

182
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,547
since I could
actually say that about a man?

183
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,007
Park your daddy issues, 'cause

184
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,717
it's time to haul ass outta here.

185
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,952
If he's not a doctor, he's...

186
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,688
- A serial killer.
- (whimpering)

187
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,624
The good news is that you're not sick.

188
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,061
The better news... Bethany.

189
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:54,430
Better news is that we're leaving.

190
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,934
OK? I'll need you to get
me a wheelchair, though.

191
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,038
(whistling)

192
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,706
- Shit.
- He's coming back.

193
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,810
- OK...
- What do I do?

194
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:10,380
Run. Get help.

195
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,051
Go!

196
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,954
Bethany, no! Bethany!

197
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:19,989
I'm not like you, Wynonna.

198
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,625
- I'm not brave.
- No...

199
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:26,562
(whistling)

200
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:35,805
Time for the doctor to go
to work. (clicking tongue)

201
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,086
(whistling)

202
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:55,825

00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,952
- Oh God, please don't...
- The doctor is

213
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,893
gonna make you feel better, Bethany.

214
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:46,375
- (heartbeat)
- (machine beeping)

215
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,145
She won't stabilize. I
can't lose another one!

216
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,647
Come on, come on!

217
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,450
(screaming)

218
00:11:05,063 --> 00:11:07,597
(flatline sound)

219
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,172
(enraged screaming)

220
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,046
It's OK. It's OK.

221
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:26,282
I can fix the next one.

222
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:28,351
I just know I can fix Wynonna.

223
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:30,779
I know Deputy Earp

224
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,016
is still out there, and we'll
continue the search,

225
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:35,652
- but we agreed my Officer...
- Is our only witness.

226
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:38,689
I need to question her before
her memory becomes more clouded

227
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,220
- than it is.
- I'd feel more

228
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,992
comfortable with a greenlight

229
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:44,227
- from her doctor.
- Sheriff.

230
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,365
I'm good.

231
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,801
- OK? I want to help.
- Well,

232
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:54,004
I'll swing by and make
sure that cat of yours is fed.

233
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,640
She doesn't really like men.

234
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,942
Well, who does?

235
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,180
OK. So what was the last thing you saw?

236
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:07,784
Waverly Earp, smiling at
me from her front porch.

237
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,722
And, uh, a man stepping
out on the highway.

238
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,057
- Flagging us down.
- Description?

239
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:17,361
No. Just a blank space after that.

240
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,696
Until the woods.

241
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,232
- What happened?
- Somebody was carrying me.

242
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:25,202
I was blindfolded, I think.

243
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,837
Or just really drugged.

244
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,706
Next thing I know I'm freezing cold,

245
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,308
covered in dirt in a ditch

246
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:33,977
- the side of the road.
- What about Wynonna?

247
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:36,346
Do you remember anything

248
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,315
- about Wynonna?
- No.

249
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,651
- I couldn't see anything.
- Sight ain't your only sense,

250
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,588
Ms. Haught.

251
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,493
What did he smell like?

252
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,781
Close your eyes. Take a deep

253
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:55,732
breath in, let the memories come.

254
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:58,168
Sour.

255
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,453
- Musty.
- Like death?

256
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:03,206
No.

257
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:06,743
Spoiled fruit. And gasoline.

258
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,711
- He kicked me.
- What?

259
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:09,800
I couldn't figure out

260
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,716
why my chest was hurting. He
threw me down and he said

261
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,118
"You're the wrong kind."

262
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:17,354
You're the wrong
kind. You're the wrong kind.

263
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,389
You're the wrong kind. Uh...

264
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:22,893
Serial killers, they, um,
often have a type of victim

265
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,694
that they prefer.

266
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,296
And Wynonna?

267
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:29,266
Must be exactly what Jack's looking for.

268
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,967
Waverly, I'm so sorry.

269
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:34,171
No, it's fine. I'm just glad you're OK.

270
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:44,915
(Dr. Reggie screaming)

271
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,567
Come on, toes... move.

272
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:34,664
(sobbing)

273
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,775
Now, now. You know she's
tougher than a boiled owl.

274
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:50,180
He's got, like, a shitload of knives.

275
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:52,449
- And she's got us.
- Ahem!

276
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,120
Initial tests came
back from Nicole's uniform.

277
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,989
Traces of ethyl alcohol.

278
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,497
Yeah, the...
gasoline smell she remembered.

279
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:02,626
Common by-product

280
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,629
of chemical
manufacture. Like designer drugs.

281
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:09,166
- Certain types of explosives.
- Sour fruit.

282
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,067
- Excuse me?
- Nicole also said

283
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,571
she smelled sour
fruit. As in fermented fruit.

284
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:17,407
- Liquor.
- Ethyl isn't in liquor.

285
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:19,809
Back in my day it
was. Bootleggers used it

286
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,876
- to make moonshine.
- Doc, you're a genius!

287
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:24,147
- Let's not get carried away.
- OK, I think I know where he has her.

288
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:27,017
Right. Late 1930s,

289
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:29,186
Purgatory gets a new
sewage system. Construction crew

290
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,389
hits what they think is a sinkhole.

291
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,884
They actually found a series of tunnels

292
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:34,509
used during
prohibition to smuggle liquor

293
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,093
- across the border.
- Prohibition?

294
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,671
From 1919 to 1933 the United States

295
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,764
banned the sale, the making

296
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,700
- and consumption of alcohol.
- Lord, I'm almost glad

297
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,902
- I was in the well for that.
- So Jack went from using

298
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:47,737
caves to using those tunnels.

299
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:50,774
- Does this map give their location?
- No, unfortunately.

300
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:53,610
The town just sealed them
up. But I think I have an idea

301
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:55,378
who might know where they are.

302
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,481
OK, 1884, Wyatt killed

303
00:15:58,517 --> 00:16:00,642
a corrupt saloon
owner named James Byers.

304
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,451
James Byers.

305
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:03,309
Same name appears again

306
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:06,456
in 1925 in connection with
a rumored liquor run.

307
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,558
It could be two guys or...

308
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,728
- Or a revenant.
- Aw, hell.

309
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,097
(chuckling)

310
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,633
- Let me guess. You knew him?
- I know him.

311
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:18,568
Runs an operation in town.

312
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,039
What kind of
operation are we talking about?

313
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:21,972
The best kind,

314
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:24,874
- highly illegal.
- (crowd cheering)

315
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,544
(barking)

316
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,313
There are two rules to this,

317
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,282
- Mr. Dolls.
- Let me guess.

318
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:35,316
First rule of fight club,
never talk about fight club, right?

319
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,040
Nobody talks about
it, how're fellas gonna

320
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:38,722
know where it is? No, the first rule is,

321
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:41,458
You never, ever bring the law.

322
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:44,294
- And what's the second rule?
- Wait here. Boss is comin'.

323
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,430
- Oh...
- (crowd and flinching)

324
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,733
- (cracking)
- Ooh!

325
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,137
What d'you think, human or revenant?
Kinda hard to tell.

326
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:57,181
Well, Whiskey Jim
likes to mix it up. 'Course,

327
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,272
the humans have no idea they're

328
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,033
stepping into the ring with a demon.

329
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,645
Adds a bit of whimsy

330
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,015
to your typical
pugilistic festivities, no?

331
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,484
Look who the cat dragged in.

332
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,987
Whiskey Jim.

333
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:12,956
Doc Holliday.

334
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,859
You being here means one of two things.

335
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,827
Either you got my 10K,

336
00:17:17,863 --> 00:17:20,764
- or you got a death wish.
- Of course,

337
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,366
you owe him money. (chuckling)

338
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:26,670
- Did I forget to mention that?
- Listen,

339
00:17:26,705 --> 00:17:29,606
this idiot doesn't have what
he owes you, but my division does.

340
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,275
All in exchange for some information.
Is there a place

341
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:35,812
- we can talk, Whiskey Jimmy?
- Bloody Black Badge?

342
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,316
Rule number one, moron.

343
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,285
(crowd cheering)

344
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,827
Yo. What up, Doctor Murder?

345
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,796
How are you feeling?

346
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,833
Floaty. These drugs are
hella dope. And coming from me,

347
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,969
- that's saying something.
- I need to ask you some questions

348
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:02,505
- about your personal history.
- Cut the bullshit.

349
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,407
I know who you are.

350
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:06,937
The last of the Seven. Which
means I'm sure as shit

351
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:08,870
- not telling you anything.
- You're awfully

352
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,321
mouthy for a girl who just found out

353
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,952
- she's paralyzed.
- Bethany hasn't come back.

354
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:13,375
I'm just scared, OK?

355
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,185
That's why it's
important to have a healthy

356
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,754
and open patient-doctor dialogue.

357
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:25,495
So tell me, Wynonna...

358
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,765
- Can you feel this?
- (cracking)

359
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,702
Nope.

360
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,738
You could be giving me a pedicure.

361
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:46,100
Good. Still,

362
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:49,671
we should up your meds.

363
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:53,641
The doctor just wants to understand
you. Don't you want

364
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:57,011
- to be understood?
- I want to be on a beach in Hawaii

365
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,314
with two very
impressionable cabana boys.

366
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:03,651
Always with the
jokes. Tell me, Wynonna...

367
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,853
What happened after you
killed your own father?

368
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,956
I was committed. Put under
the care of a 'specialist'.

369
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:11,526
Every time I told the
truth, I got a nice jolt

370
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,161
of electric juice.

371
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:16,297
- Was the shock therapy effective?
- Yeah.

372
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,701
Made me good at poker and now I
don't have to shave my left leg.

373
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,270
You use humor as a form of self-defence.

374
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,974
I prefer my Buntline special.
What'd you do with Peacemaker?

375
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,878
Get a good grip on it?

376
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:32,413
Stings a little, don't it, Revenant?

377
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:45,624
- Hey, that's mine.
- What is it doing over here?

378
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,115
You must've snagged it on something

379
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,730
when you wheeled me in. Give it back.

380
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,832
Answer my questions

381
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,668
- without any more guff.
- And you won't cut me open?

382
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:57,105
Wynonna, we have to do the surgery.

383
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,241
- For your own good.
- To fix me, yeah. Did you fix Bethany?

384
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:02,308
The doctor has ensured that
she's in no more pain.

385
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,688
What is with psychos and talking
in the third person?

386
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:06,748
I'm not psycho!

387
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,816
Fine, you're not
psycho. You're not psycho.

388
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:11,085
You're delightful. Top notch.

389
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,028
I'll answer whatever, OK?

390
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:16,357
Just put my necklace back on me, please.

391
00:20:25,664 --> 00:20:28,002
On second thought, you're
not really in a position

392
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:30,938
to do any bargaining, are you?

393
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,415
OK, look, we just need the entrance

394
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,450
to your old
bootlegging tunnels, that's it.

395
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:45,486
Let's say I was willing
to help you. And I ain't.

396
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:48,863
Those tunnels are of no
use to you or anyone.

397
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,125
They were boarded up a long time ago.

398
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,661
- Nobody knows how to find them.
- Well, somebody does.

399
00:20:53,696 --> 00:20:55,696
That 'someone'

400
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,099
has a very sharp
blade and Bobo's backin'.

401
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:02,336
- Ain't got nothin' to do with me.
- Look, just tell us where they are

402
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:05,206
and we'll be on our
way, alright, Whiskey?

403
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,344
This is my place.

404
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,313
(deep voice): I do the asking.

405
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:15,783
And you owe me plenty.

406
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:18,186
Look, we are all businessmen here.

407
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:20,154
Can't we come to some
sort of arrangement?

408
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,857
Hmm...

409
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,487
You do look like you
can handle yourself.

410
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:31,766
Yeah, I do alright.

411
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:34,268
(laughing)

412
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:38,039
Alright. You want my help?

413
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:41,142
You two need to earn it. Here,

414
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,344
now.

415
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:45,379
In the ring.

416
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:48,115
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You
really want me to fight him?

417
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:49,741
- What, you yella?
- No, I'm being

418
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,786
realistic, and let's
be real, you won't get

419
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,088
- your money's worth.
- Oh, I'll take that bet.

420
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,057
- Shut up.
- Whatever.

421
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:58,092
Just make sure there's blood.

422
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:00,394
Lots of it. One of you

423
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,130
leaves on a stretcher, or neither
of you leaves at all.

424
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,199
You give me that?

425
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:08,069
I'll tell you where my tunnels are.

426
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:09,737
Rule number two,

427
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:13,407
don't come if you
ain't willing to fight.

428
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:28,055
Wynonna!

429
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:31,459
Wynonna!

This fella's been looking for
a chance to give you this.

431
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:50,611
Boss man sent him.

432
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:52,780
I guess Bobo wants
you alive for something.

433
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:55,349
You best read it quick.

you slimy motha...

440
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:17,605
- (bell dinging)
- Place your bets, gents!

441
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,078
Alright, let's go!

442
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,681
Come on!

443
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:34,855
- That's enough. It's showtime.
- Alright.

444
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,893
OK, look, we're running out of time.

445
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:41,295
Let's just give this guy what he wants.

446
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:44,532
- We should make it look real.
- Who says it ain't?

447
00:23:48,871 --> 00:23:52,106
- Oof!
- Heh, heh!

448
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:54,508
Alright, old-timer. Playtime's over.

- (cheering)
- (laughing)

451
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,960
I see you've found my missing scalpel.

452
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:14,593
Know how to make someone show you

453
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:16,330
where something precious is hidden?

454
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:19,033
Set fire to their house.

455
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,502
It's the first thing they go for.

456
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:23,638
Wynonna, don't be rash.

457
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:26,974
You'll never find Officer
Haught without me.

458
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,577
New deal, Reggimite.

459
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:31,246
Tell me where she is, and I'll make

460
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:32,880
your trip back to hell an express.

461
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:35,616
Screw around, and I will have some fun

462
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:38,453
before I blow your Revenant brains out.

463
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:39,949
Hell?

464
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:42,289
You killed Nicole,

465
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:44,759
- didn't you, you sonuvabitch?
- No.

466
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:49,563
Red blood? You're human.

467
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,508
I'm sorry, Doctor.

468
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,243
No need to say sorry, Reginald.

469
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:05,713
You served your purpose.

470
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:07,882
And now, you are released.

471
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:11,485
Who are you?

472
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:13,754
I've had a lot of names.

if you hand me over to the authorities.

one hell of a show. You killed him!

Much obliged.

502
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,903
Now, I expect Black
Badge will be snooping around,

503
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,905
asking about their missing agent.

504
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,141
- I'd make myself scarce, ASAP.
- The entrance to the tunnels.

505
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:08,177
Now, I promised him that information.

506
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:10,613

That file Dolls had was classified.

- How'd Bobo get it?
- We revenants

511
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,098
are trapped inside the
Ghost River Triangle.

512
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:32,768
But Bobo, his reach extends
far beyond that.

513
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:35,604
He's got friends in
high places, that one.

Oh, oh, oh!

I, uh,

516
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:43,245
got these off your dead friend.

Your nose is bleeding.

Got a tampon?

Or, you know,

530
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:19,742
an inkling to get me to a real hospital?

531
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,111
Wyatt's nose bled like
that when I first met him.

532
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:25,447
I've been studying you for a long while.

533
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:27,416
We are so alike.

534
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,318
- Insane?
- No.

535
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:31,037
You work with a team, not because you

536
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,588
want to, but because you have to.

537
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:36,125
Like me. And you prefer to hunt alone.

538
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,526
Like me.

539
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:42,498
This is a trick that Reginald taught me.

540
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,500
Surgeons today

541
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,298
like to draw a map on their patients

542
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,870
for where they're going to cut.

543
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:51,273
- Any chance this surgery is elective?
- It's mandatory, I'm afraid.

544
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,943
Thought doctors had to
take an oath to do no harm.

545
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,180
I've never really been a doctor.

546
00:30:58,215 --> 00:30:59,948
But I did study surgery.

547
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:03,318
And by study, I mean, I
love to cut open bodies.

548
00:31:03,354 --> 00:31:05,187
I like to see what
makes people... people.

549
00:31:05,222 --> 00:31:07,523
See, even when I was human,

550
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,491
I wasn't.

551
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,593
Not way down deep.
- I owe Reggie

552
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,896
an apology. You're the
sickest puppy in the litter.

553
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:16,832
- Flattery's not gonna save you.
- What is your damage?

554
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:19,535
- Mommy didn't love you enough?
- (giggling)

555
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,810
Or is this because every
woman you ever met rejected you?

556
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:24,873
Maybe.

557
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:27,743
Your dime-store psychology

558
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,212
is adorable, Wynonna.

559
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,181
I love women.

560
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,717
Can't you tell?

561
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:37,853
Feast for the eyes. And every man

562
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:39,888
has a favorite body part

563
00:31:39,924 --> 00:31:41,890
upon which to gaze.

564
00:31:41,926 --> 00:31:44,526
(whispering): I love to
look at your organs.

565
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:46,729
And I'm gonna keep you alive

566
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:49,398
just long enough

567
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,433
that you can look at them too.

568
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:58,348
You dead, and now you are nuts.

569
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,927
Oh, how the tables and have turned.

570
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:05,565
Army Night Rangers. Elite
paramilitary unit.

571
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,868
They train us in how to lower our
pulse, control our breathing.

572
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:11,771
- Make the enemy think you're dead.
- Oh, aren't you

573
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,791
- the master of deception.
- Here we go.

574
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:14,707
If your bosses

575
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,876
have no compunction about
turning a person

576
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:19,412
into a pin cushion, how are
they better than the demons?

577
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:22,115
Your body is a
treasure trove for science.

578
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,083
Think about what the
military could do with soldiers

579
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,953
who didn't get sick, didn't age?

580
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,155
It was a decision made for
the good of the many.

581
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,958
I get to choose who I share
my treasure trove with,

582
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,927
not the goddamn government.

583
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:35,828
If Wynonna

584
00:32:35,864 --> 00:32:38,498
wasn't in danger, I
would shoot you right now.

585
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,226
Yeah. If Wynonna wasn't in danger,

586
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:41,968
you would be in the back of a van.

587
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,670
Hey, hey, hey! Watch it!

588
00:32:43,705 --> 00:32:45,687
Ooh! Easy now.

589
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:50,843
I'm just gettin' ready.
But once Wynonna is safe...

590
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,346
Yeah. Once Wynonna's safe.

591
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,916
Now.

592
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,487
How the hell do we get in there?

593
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:04,357
Reginald always used antiseptic

594
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:06,392
because he thought that there
was a chance that the patients

595
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:08,361
would survive the procedure, but...

596
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:10,563
let's not kid ourselves.

597
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,000
You're not gonna survive this.

598
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,603
Now...

599
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:19,906
only the best for the heir.

600
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:21,874
Wait!

601
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,877
Before I die, just tell me.

602
00:33:24,913 --> 00:33:27,680
- Tell you what?
- Why.

603
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:28,965
Why send the posse of seven?

604
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,430
If Bobo really wanted my daddy dead,

605
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:32,385
- he could've done it himself.
- Don't forget,

606
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,321
it wasn't the posse that
killed dear old Ward.

607
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:37,790
It was a scared and
confused little girl.

608
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:41,394
- It was an accident.
- I know, I was there.

609
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:44,163
I know you're not gonna believe this,
but I really liked your father.

610
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,466
He wasn't like the other Earp heirs.

611
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:49,669
He wasn't ambitious like Edwin,

612
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:51,704
or courageous like Josiah,

613
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,840
but he had something
that they didn't have.

614
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,808
Wits.

615
00:33:55,844 --> 00:33:57,877
When Ward started his little ride,

616
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,847
he realized that in order to survive,

617
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:02,882
he was gonna have to
make certain alliances.

618
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,485
- With who? Black Badge?
- Don't be daft.

619
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,087
He made a pact with the big man himself.

620
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:10,123
Bobo Del Rey.

621
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,995
No. My daddy would never make a deal

622
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:19,532
- with a demon. Never.
- They were very close friends.

623
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:22,402
(scoffing) Liar.

624
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,272
I'm sorry, Wynonna, that
I break your heart.

625
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,275
Now I'm going to cut it out.

626
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,678
No! No!

627
00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:34,013
(gunshot)

628
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:36,303
- Took you long enough.
- You're welcome.

629
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:37,216
Doc Holliday.

630
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:39,519
I always hoped that I'd
have this pleasure.

631
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,930
Where did you get the
Stone Witch's trinket?

632
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:58,071
Normally I just carve up women,

633
00:34:58,106 --> 00:35:00,406
but, Doctor, in your case I'm
gonna make an exception.

634
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:03,843
Looks like it's just
me and you, Jackie Boy.

635
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,535
- Go! Go get it.
- Peacemaker?

636
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,260
Yeah.

637
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:22,962
It's across the hall. Whisky barrels.

638
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:25,698
Quick! OK.

639
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,192
Did I get him?

640
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:54,794
Not your job.

641
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:57,330
Oh!

642
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:59,599
It just got a little wet.

643
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:03,469
Mmm. Oak-aged.

644
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:06,706
Thank you. Don't kill each other.

645
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,343
Alright...

646
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:14,213
- So.
- Yep.

647
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:17,416
- Good talk.
- Oh, we are done talkin'.

648
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,703
I think this would be a
good juncture to remind you

649
00:36:23,704 --> 00:36:27,755
that I am the fastest
gunslinger that ever walked the earth.

650
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,824
Hm. Debatable. What about Billy the Kid?

651
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:31,792
Ooh, I should shoot you right now,

652
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:34,428
just for being such an
obstreperous jackass.

653
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:37,098
So go ahead. Take me out.

654
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:40,028
Just know they've got satellites.
Predator drones.

655
00:36:40,153 --> 00:36:41,554
You look like you just came out of the

656
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,171
Grand Ole Opry, so
they will find you, Doc.

657
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,973
And you, sir, are an asshole.

658
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:48,442
But you are not a villain.

659
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,912
So why, Dolls?

660
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:56,017
It was you. Or her.

661
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:01,589
I see.

662
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:06,360
D'you know what Wyatt used
to say? He used to say,

663
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:09,664
'Doc, well, if you stand for nothing,

664
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,200
you are sure to fall.'

665
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:13,868
What was I supposed to do?

666
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:16,971
You do what you do best, Deputy
Marshal Dolls, you fight.

667
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:23,377
OK.

668
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:32,320
Well, that was easy.

669
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:51,439
(grunting and wheezing)

670
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:11,926
Just think about it. Think about it.

671
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:13,861
Think about it.

672
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:15,930
I'm the last of the Seven.

673
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:19,133
What happens when you kill me?

674
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:21,535
Order too much Thai

675
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,904
and open a bottle of wine?

676
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Once I'm gone,

677
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:28,542
you'll have to deal with
the puppet master.

678
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:31,302
And Bobo Del Rey

679
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:34,436
makes the rest of us
look like choir boys.

680
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:35,416
Yeah.

681
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:38,719
But he'll still make the
same pathetic hissing sound

682
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:42,056
- when I shoot him between the eyes.
- You're talking tough,

683
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:45,593
but you're just like me. You're broken.

684
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:48,829
I can hear the fear in your voice.

685
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:52,366
- (gun cocking)
- (Jack laughing)

686
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:58,172
Oh, I wish I could stay!

687
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:02,510
Watch what's coming next.

688
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:04,578
A reunion...

689
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:06,647
an escape.

690
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:08,716
So much blood.

691
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:10,951
You attacked my home

692
00:39:10,987 --> 00:39:14,155
and killed my sister.

693
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,291
- Now make your peace.
- What's the hurry, little girl?

694
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:20,828
Enjoy the moment.

695
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:22,663
- Savor the kill.
- Who's this,

696
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:25,032
you do impressions now?
Who is that, Judi Dench?

697
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,568
You've solved a great mystery.

698
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:29,637
Succeeded where Scotland Yard failed,

699
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,909
and all

700
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:34,275
by your lonesome.

701
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:38,713
I ain't interested.

702
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:41,849
And I'm not lonesome.

703
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:45,586
I just prefer to hunt alone.

704
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,033

705

706

You have to let go sometime, Waves.

Maybe tomorrow.

708
00:40:57,627 --> 00:40:59,627
Well,

709
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,796
just like that, the Seven are gone.

710
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,732
Just like that, huh?

711
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:09,303
So what now?

712
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,341
Wynonna?

713
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:25,508
You stand by this report?

714
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:27,590
That your Deputy possibly dispatched

715
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:29,757
the most notorious serial
killer in history?

716
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:32,126
I said possibly. There's no way
to prove it without a body.

717
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:35,362
How convenient. Where's my delivery?

718
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:39,009
Oh yeah. I will be formally withdrawing
the report I filed

719
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,723
on the alleged target. Henry is nothing

720
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:43,070
but a con artist. A good one, but...

721
00:41:43,105 --> 00:41:45,506
- the real Doc Holliday is dead.
- You continue

722
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,807
to disappoint me.

723
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:58,115
As long as I keep surprising you.

724
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:01,088
Always.

725
00:42:07,964 --> 00:42:09,930
<i>(Dolls): I've acquired a local asset.</i>

726
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:12,700
<i>A revenant from within Bobo
Del Rey's inner circle.</i>

727
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:16,537
<i>- Trusted lieutenant.
- (whimpering)</i>

728
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:20,990
<i>I will test the limits of
his physical body. And his mind.</i>

729
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,977
<i>No method will be spared.</i>

730
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:26,146
<i>After all, there's no danger
of him dying on me... at least,</i>

731
00:42:26,182 --> 00:42:27,948
<i>not permanently.</i>

732
00:42:31,187 --> 00:42:33,621
Seems there's a mole in
my organization, Jim.

733
00:42:33,656 --> 00:42:36,095
And you are going to help me find them.
