1
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,986
Ain't no one here.

2
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,321
Keep it down!

3
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,491
Dang.

4
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,559
What the hell?

5
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,829
Cost me a week's income.

6
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,905
Don't you know hens?

7
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,239
You go and wake them,
sudden, like that... they won't lay!

8
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,334
You want eggs?

9
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,710
- Are you the sheriff?
- Are you President McKinley?

10
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,818
Now what does it look like.
We ain't got any sheriff here.

11
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,116
We ain't got nothing.
It all belongs to McGowan.

12
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,188
Say, what's that smell in the air?

13
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,620
That delicate odor also
belongs to McGowan.

14
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,185
It's from the silver mine...

15
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,890
...which is McGowan's, of course.

16
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,361
Where's a town with a marshal in it?

17
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,666
I have a reward to collect.

18
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,836
You could try and make it to
Cassidy...

19
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,774
...but with this downpour,
I sure don't advise it.

20
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,705
Is there someplace here
to bed down in?

21
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,474
The bunkhouse. It's for the miners.

22
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,810
First you got to get permission
from McGowan.

23
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,852
You ain't ever gonna get it.

24
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,517
Where is this McGowan?

25
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,717
You take a dozen eggs.

26
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,053
They will be nice with
coffee in the morning...

27
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,722
...on the trail to Cassidy!
Good night.

28
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,127
It's awful late you know.

29
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,896
You don't want your hens up
all night long.

30
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,396
Where is McGowan?

31
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,800
He lives on the hill west of town...

32
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,278
...but the one you want to see
is his watchdog, Voller.

33
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,405
He'll be in the drugstore.

34
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,174
Thank you, my friend.

35
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,387
I'll take 3 cards.

36
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,434
- Two.
- One.

37
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,735
Where's Voller?

38
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,771
- Huh?
- Voller.

39
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,444
- He's asking for Voller.
- What do you want him for?

40
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,815
He's busy at the moment
and doesn't want to be disturbed.

41
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,149
You can talk to me.

42
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,359
I'm looking for somewhere
for us to bunk down for the night.

43
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,462
You boys walk in a place and
people see you dripping mud...

44
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,461
...like a couple of pigs, you can't
expect them to offer their beds.

45
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,243
I'd like to buy my new friend a beer.

46
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,471
And, this one.
He's had a long walk.

47
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,579
We don't serve any alcohol in here
after midnight.

48
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,279
And, everyone always obeys
the rules.

49
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,148
Except at cards.

50
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,830
500.

51
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,505
5.

52
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,511
That's too rich for my blood.
I'm out.

53
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,183
Cost you 5,000 to stay in now.

54
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,754
That's a lot of pressure you're
putting on me, Voller.

55
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,228
You're not getting my silver,
too. Fold.

56
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,834
You've got the damndest luck
I ever seen. The pot is yours.

57
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,235
I'm through trying to beat you.

58
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,327
Then, move over.

59
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,338
I'll play you for 5,000 dollars.

60
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,188
Okay, amigo.

61
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,564
But first, I want to see your
5,000 dollars.

62
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,564
That's it over there.

63
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,063
You just bring him to a marshal.

64
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,072
Is this some kind of joke?

65
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,249
If so, it's funny to your friend only.

66
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,085
We don't pick up tabs around here.

67
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:50,986
So I hear.

68
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,923
This is a peaceful place.
Doesn't it look like it to you?

69
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,590
These people are upstanding
and honest.

70
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,265
And all hard-working employees
of McGowan...

71
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,700
...until they die of dust poisoning
in the mines.

72
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,775
Who are you?

73
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,072
Those that know me call me Blade...

74
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,942
...because I got a habit of
letting this do my talking for me.

75
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,325
What do you want?

76
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,029
To try my luck with your
pack of cards.

77
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,491
Fine.

78
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,137
Let's play.

79
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,376
Sorry, I don't like poker.

80
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,246
You what?

81
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,448
Let's just play high-card-to-win.

82
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,490
You pick one first.

83
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,790
Nine.

84
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,171
Ten.

85
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,250
Let's go double or nothing.

86
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,113
No.

87
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,591
As you might have guessed,
I know other languages.

88
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,448
Keep dropping it real easy...

89
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,882
...or you won't be as lucky
as your dogs.

90
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,032
Your feet will really stink
when you take your boots off.

91
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,593
So what?

92
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,740
So 5,000 dollars is what I wanted,
not your smell.

93
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,332
Go on, get out of here, Craven.

94
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,239
Come again?

95
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,110
Hit the trail.

96
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,714
You son of a bitch,
letting me go like this.

97
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,080
You're the most goddamn,
unpredictable bastard I know!

98
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,116
Don't waste your breath.
You might want to run...

99
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,849
...because when I need money again...

100
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,427
They'll be coming.

101
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,934
They couldn't scare me off.

102
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,700
Quit dragging your feet!

103
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,404
Move that cart along!

104
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,845
Move it along, move it!

105
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,952
I sure hope we don't run into
Dolman's bunch, again.

106
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,964
My men know a trail that swings north of
where Dolman's been operating.

107
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,366
They'll take you to Selma Springs.
You'll be okay from there.

108
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,801
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

109
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,463
Don't forget to come back!

110
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,649
Bring back Irish pipes from Selma.

111
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,384
Let's go.

112
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,301
I can't read, Dolman, but I can guess!

113
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,163
Who are you?
What do you want?

114
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,340
An awful lot of people have been
asking me that, lately.

115
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,335
Where's your father?

116
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,679
Stop right where you are.
Get your hands up.

117
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,618
Up to the hat.

118
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,025
Debra, I'll handle this.

119
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,861
This would never, ever
go through her...

120
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,203
...then, we'd both feel silly.

121
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,442
That pistol won't be necessary,
McGowan.

122
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,013
Who are you?

123
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,544
Some day we'll get around to that.

124
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,884
I'm here tonight about prices.

125
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:26,852
Prices?

126
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,550
You pay 2,000 dollars a week...

127
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,893
...I'll be your straw boss.

128
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,160
You have imagination.

129
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,563
It would be worth improving
your defenses.

130
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,229
With Dolman gobbling up your silver
as fast as you can mine it...

131
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,577
...the McGowan empire won't
last too long.

132
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,576
I already employ a whole army to
defend the empire.

133
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,085
It's a poor battle commander that
won't do a little observation.

134
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,981
A fatal mistake.

135
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,524
You still got time to make Suttonville...

136
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,534
...before I have Voller give
something else to his dogs for dinner.

137
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,484
You were given
the wrong information...

138
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,385
...because we've reached an
understanding, his dogs and I.

139
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,785
Think it over, McGowan.

140
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,923
Just stand there and
let the fella walk out?

141
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,706
Hey! Pig-Sty!

142
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,134
My friends would like to see how
you can make out with these.

143
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,445
I got no guns.

144
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,583
Take off your guns, boys.

145
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,098
My blessings.
They are all yours.

146
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,881
Stop it.
That's enough!

147
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,056
You'll pay for this,
you son-of-a-bitch.

148
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,246
I'd say we done pretty good.

149
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,147
Yeah, let's go.

150
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,148
Hold it.

151
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,983
If we don't bring his carcass back,
Voller will think we're just faking it.

152
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,078
Come on.

153
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:03,899
We're almost there.

154
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,739
You've been saying that
for the last two days.

155
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,354
Johnny, look over there.

156
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,655
Pop used to say that dead men
on a pile of stones are best left alone.

157
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,660
I'm turning us around.

158
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:25,727
No, wait.

159
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,728
Where you going?

160
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,590
Angela! It could mean trouble.

161
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,758
Why do you wanna get
mixed up in this?

162
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,273
One of them is still alive.
Come on!

163
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,780
I'm sorry, McGowan...

164
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,746
...but if you can't guarantee
your consignment of silver...

165
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:51,947
...we'll be forced to shift the contract
to Virginia City come June.

166
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,517
But if bandits attack the wagons
every time, how can I...

167
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:56,851
...guarantee it?

168
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,121
It's up to the Treasury Department
to send me proper escorts for them.

169
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,325
Army Secretary Fiske has complained
you've cost him too many men...

170
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,368
...and that's not part of
the contract.

171
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,367
It says you have full responsibility
as far as Fort Riley, Texas...

172
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,934
...and it also provides funds to hire
men to protect those shipments.

173
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,133
Where are they?

174
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,704
Now we're doing all that's
possible...

175
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,807
...but this bandit Dolman,
he's got a lot of men.

176
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,712
- He's well organized.
- I understand that.

177
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:28,052
All I can do is ask the army
to let you have more guards.

178
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,592
Beyond that, it's your problem.

179
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,489
- I'll keep in touch.
- Right, and thanks.

180
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,292
Voller.

181
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:45,842
I don't believe I've got the strength
to go on with this work.

182
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,144
I've begun to have visions of
my tombstone.

183
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:55,509
- McGowan, come on.
- I know what I'm saying.

184
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,846
But that's not what I'd like to
discuss with you.

185
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,252
Debra has never fit in with
dust poison.

186
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,759
No, I... I feel I should send her to
New Orleans...

187
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,592
...to learn how to be a lady.

188
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,890
Will you take her there?

189
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,859
Sure.

190
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,867
I'll join her as soon as
I've wrapped things up here.

191
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,909
All of a sudden, the empire
smells very cold.

192
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,777
You know the smell?

193
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,906
- Well, we're almost finished.
- We'll be right up.

194
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,131
Well, peekin' at women again,
already, are you?

195
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,674
When we found you, we thought
you'd never pull through.

196
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,337
Let's see the leg.

197
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,846
What's the matter with it?

198
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,349
Oh, nothing much, considering
your constitution.

199
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,043
Nothing but a huge gaping hole...

200
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,747
...which I am about to try to
sew up. Now then.

201
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,555
Are you a Quaker?

202
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,922
Who? A Quaker? Me?

203
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,453
All those women out there...
aren't they married to you?

204
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:51,231
Married? Married?!
If I had married 5 women like that...

205
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,793
...you'd be looking at the world's
most cuckolded husband!

206
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,032
Those women are my capital.

207
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,506
If it hurts you too much, here...

208
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,339
...it's not the best of brands, but
it'll do the trick.

209
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,242
Are you gonna...

210
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,507
That's right. Sew your leg up...

211
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,611
...unless you prefer
to get gangrene?

212
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,475
Ah, so, you're a doctor.

213
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,418
Not actually. I used to be a
women's tailor.

214
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,616
Of course, if you object...

215
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,088
Only if you put on buttons.

216
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,326
It was a perfect trap. There
shouldn't have been any problem.

217
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,496
You might have thought of
telling me before.

218
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,594
Maybe they ran into something
unexpected, and didn't want to rush it.

219
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,640
Only, somebody would be back
by now to get help.

220
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,040
Tell Billy Worm and Tabby
to saddle up.

221
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,202
Without his horse, the dude
ain't gone far.

222
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,539
Let's go.

223
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,239
Hold it!

224
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,609
This wagon must have turned around
less than 6 hours ago!

225
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,920
Follow the tracks!

226
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:28,798
That's it! Up higher!
Gotta let them see it.

227
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:37,232
Hey you! What are you
doing on this trail?

228
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,406
We were on our way toward
Cassidy...

229
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,240
...but halfway up, the pass was
blocked by a rockslide.

230
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,837
So, we came back this way
and set up camp.

231
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,218
You ain't, by any chance,
seen any strays in the pass?

232
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,115
I would have been delighted to.

233
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,256
The ladies are burning up
to show their talents.

234
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,086
Gonna take over a saloon in
Weston...

235
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,787
...but it's hard to keep hot chicken
simmering forever!

236
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,359
Yeah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

237
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,592
It's a great disappointment
to me that...

238
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,671
...we have no time to savor the
delights of your spectacle.

239
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,503
You know, if there's some other
trail we could take?

240
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,668
I'm not at all acquainted
with these parts...

241
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,643
...and we sure do want to
get to Weston.

242
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,041
Now who are you hiding in your
wagon over there?

243
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,147
No one, sir.

244
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,466
Why the guns?

245
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,603
Wait a minute!

246
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,172
Stop it, please! My wagon,
you're destroying it!

247
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,679
It will take weeks to repair it!
What did I do to deserve this?

248
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,112
Look what you've done to this hat,
you stupid simpletons!

249
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,584
It was a brand new, original
from Paris!

250
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,384
Cost me all of 64 dollars in
New Orleans!

251
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,958
Who's gonna pay me
for my hat?!

252
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,755
Shut that squawker's mouth,
and look inside the wagon.

253
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,659
The dogs can't be wrong!

254
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,464
But you can't do this!
We're not hiding anything!

255
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,404
There's nothing, only clothes!

256
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,908
Unless he's in the walls.

257
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,680
Stupid dogs.
Let's go.

258
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,397
You see?
Worked like a charm!

259
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,198
It only cost 5 dollars.
I bought it in Bitter Creek...

260
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,141
...but you're gonna get me a new one.

261
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,677
None of that.
You may be handsome...

262
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,909
...but you're just as rotten
as every other man.

263
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,882
Soon as I'm better, we're
going to Suttonville.

264
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,479
I have a hankering to do
some dancing.

265
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,217
Suttonville?! Are you crazy?

266
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,452
That bigot McGowan won't allow
dancers inside the city limits.

267
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,961
Don't worry, I'll get you a
special permit.

268
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,903
Take the dogs and search the
other end of the pass.

269
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,569
He's got to be around here
somewhere.

270
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,377
I'm heading back to town!

271
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,066
Mr. Voller?
The stage just pulled in.

272
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,000
Are you ready?

273
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,718
Let's get those bags loaded.

274
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,561
Get back on the stage.
It's about to start.

275
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,392
Passengers have a right to
an hour's rest!

276
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,466
Around here, we decide the
passengers' rights.

277
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,828
At least let me go take a piss.

278
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,526
No, we're leaving.
Get in. Go on.

279
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,725
No need to push us around.

280
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,207
You ought to be thankful
Mr. McGowan is providing an escort...

281
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,504
...for the rest of the journey to
protect you.

282
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,740
Go on.

283
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,112
And here we go.
Let's hear it!

284
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,316
It's Johnny-Johnny
and his ballet Parisienne!

285
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,453
Hey, it's the ballet Parisienne!

286
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:32,652
For the first time west of the
Mississippi...

287
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,991
...you'll see the famous dance
of the garters!

288
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,471
It's as good a place as any other...

289
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,936
...if you can get them to let us stay.

290
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,171
They will let you stay.

291
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:27,079
Looks like they haven't seen
a woman since the Flood.

292
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,103
I travel the southwest
route twice a year...

293
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,615
...but I'll be darned if I've ever seen
a trail as rough as this one.

294
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,172
What do you say, Miss?

295
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,684
Think maybe we ought to change
lines in Dallas?

296
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,481
Yeah, and maybe a long time
before then...

297
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,990
...and you can rest assured
I'll make my voice heard.

298
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,355
I have never been treated so
ungallantly and thoughtlessly in my life.

299
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,894
Protest as much as you please...

300
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,455
...but they're traveling a
different trail for a reason.

301
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,467
This whole area is infested
with bandits.

302
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,070
Good Lord!
Outlaw hooligans?!

303
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,498
Voller, how long is it to the
next way station?

304
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,536
Many a mile, Miss.
You people care for a nip of rum?

305
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,104
- No thank-you.
- Imported from the Isle of Jamaica!

306
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,721
End of the line, friends!

307
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,918
Oh, God!

308
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,791
Shuck the hardware,
grab a cloud.

309
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,434
You four! Move away from
the stage!

310
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,970
What are you, a fool?!

311
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,634
I want you all out, your hands up high,
over your head, where I can see them.

312
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,366
Relieve this gent of his irons.

313
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,039
Come on!
Out!

314
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,634
Don't murder me.

315
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,112
Stop making such a fuss!
Out!

316
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,145
Move it.
Come on!

317
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,678
Last but not least,
Edward McGowan's only daughter!

318
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,057
It's better you eliminate them all.

319
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,124
Looks like rain.

320
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,927
All right, let's go.

321
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,340
All right, the show's over!
You tramps get off the stage!

322
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:09,817
Shut your mouth and do what
you're told. Mr. McGowan's orders!

323
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,998
Let my girls go, damn it!
Leave them alone!

324
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,899
Give 20 lashes to each one of
these sinners and shave their heads.

325
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,604
May the good Lord on high
drive out the spawn of Satan!

326
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,173
Start with that one, howling
like a demon.

327
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,445
What demon?!

328
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,745
You're the real demon,
whipping these innocent girls!

329
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,252
Let me get them out of town.
We'll never come back.

330
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,081
Get back and keep quiet!

331
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:02,577
Go get him!

332
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,280
Idiots! lmbeciles!

333
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,574
You got 28 guns against one!

334
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,908
Get him!

335
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,545
Call them off.

336
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,766
Bandits... The bandits...

337
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,911
They took your daughter.

338
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,111
Is it Voller?

339
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,827
Where is she?

340
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,463
Have a look.

341
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,998
It's hard to recognize her
way up there.

342
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,535
Give him the glass.

343
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:43,060
You can tell Voller that
I'm willing to pay whatever he wants.

344
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:45,263
Voller?

345
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:51,271
Voller. I'm not so old and not so
stupid not to have seen right away...

346
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,433
...that this was set up by Voller.

347
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,135
No need to rush it.
Not for that much money.

348
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:59,140
You got plenty of time to put together
everything you own and...

349
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,446
...all the silver your men can mine.
Come on.

350
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,310
Hurry up.
Get on with that loading!

351
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,812
Move! Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

352
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:40,211
You're a bunch of lazy idlers!
You've got to earn your wages.

353
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,890
Hurry up. Move it!

354
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,332
Hurry up. Move it. Cut down the trees!

355
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:03,173
You can't! You can't do this.
This is my land!

356
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,269
My land now!

357
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,872
- Get off of it!
- You get off!

358
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,143
Get off my land!

359
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,583
Let's get started.
Cut down all these trees.

360
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:22,321
Your help is the last thing I want,
but I don't have any choice now.

361
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,125
Let's hear a price.

362
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,963
10,000 dollars.

363
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,330
Ten times that.

364
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,711
100,000?
That's totally unreasonable!

365
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:44,210
Look at that ore they're taking out.
That's just to meet their demands.

366
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:49,588
I gave up deliveries to Fort Riley and
I'm losing my government contract!

367
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,699
100,000.

368
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:05,605
So be it. But I want you to get my
child back, safe and sound.

369
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:06,739
If you fail...

370
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,269
I ain't finished.

371
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,078
I was told that years ago
the air around here was clean...

372
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,850
...and life was easy and carefree.

373
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,249
And worth nothing.

374
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,319
I changed all that and
it belongs to me now.

375
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,225
What else do you want?

376
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,678
Allow my friend, Johnny-Johnny,
to set up here in Suttonville...

377
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,676
...and re-open the saloon.

378
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,548
It will give these poor souls
something to look forward to.

379
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:54,790
Re-open the saloon? These men
have got to stick to working...

380
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:58,725
...and not be distracted with
disgusting spectacles of Babylon.

381
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,935
You're not pushing us out.
This land is my land!

382
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:07,828
It's mine now.

383
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,040
On the beginning of
Judgement Day...

384
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:17,212
...there won't be anyone in line
before you, McGowan.

385
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,613
The shows we're gonna put on!
They will come from all over.

386
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,712
Look at that sign. Not even the
Pecos House in Dallas...

387
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:31,590
...has a sign like that.
Hey there, Shorty! Hey, listen!

388
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:36,792
How about him in a frilly outfit?
See ya later! Got to work.

389
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,827
We've still got the whole second
floor to clean. It's going great.

390
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,632
Let's go, girls.
Right on upstairs.

391
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,732
It's been Johnny-Johnny's dream
to own his own place...

392
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,309
...and now he's finally got one.

393
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,944
What is your great dream?

394
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:56,342
I don't dream any longer, but you know,
every now and then...

395
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,183
...I think, if I had a lot of money,
I would go away to Paris...

396
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,018
...or London or whatever.

397
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,192
What I mean is, I'd just travel
wherever I wanted to.

398
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,486
And then what?
Come back home?

399
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,662
I know I shouldn't ask you.
Will you stay?

400
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,041
Who can tell?
I can't bet on covered cards.

401
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:38,627
10 times 10. You certainly
drive a hard bargain.

402
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,261
And all of that there is for Debra.

403
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,899
You're to follow the back trail into
high country.

404
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,463
They'll show up when they see fit,
but stay on the look out.

405
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,372
They wanted me to go.
Unfortunately I'm no longer able to...

406
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,243
...defend myself,
much less my daughter.

407
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,308
But I'm not looking for your sympathy.

408
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,444
Your wealth can get you anything
with a price on it.

409
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,019
Men even die for it.

410
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:11,726
But it can't buy you the one thing
you've never had.

411
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:13,887
Human kindness.

412
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:23,167
Do you mind telling me just
what your real name is?

413
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,534
To a man with your amount of
conscience, I doubt if it will ring bells.

414
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:31,774
The name I was born to is buried
in a wood grove with my dead father.

415
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:40,287
Are you the son of...
Gerald Merton?

416
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,287
Yeah.
How do you feel?

417
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,034
Pa! Papa!

418
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,165
Gerald! Gerald!

419
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,585
With his wife and son here...
Go on, get them out of there.

420
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,207
It was an accident.
It wasn't me.

421
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,909
It was just an accident.
It wasn't anybody's fault.

422
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,320
Yes, it was.

423
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,155
You stole the land, remember?

424
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,830
No! I bought that land,
under territorial concession.

425
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,793
And destroyed a man in doing so.

426
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,533
Gerald Merton refused to bend
with the movement of progress.

427
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,235
The minerals under your father's land
enrich the world.

428
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,537
Especially you.

429
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:13,914
Your minerals have brought greed,
disease, and filth.

430
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,450
Just look at the miners.

431
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,543
All right, kill me.

432
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:22,291
Blow my head off if you think
that's going to avenge your father.

433
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,827
But I warn you,
you've got the wrong enemy.

434
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:32,399
I know I do.

435
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,561
But you're finished,
McGowan.

436
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,738
For 20 years, my only dream was
to face you down and kill you...

437
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,372
...for what you did to my father.
And you know...

438
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,979
...you're not worth the brass of my
7 penny cartridges.

439
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:57,450
The worst punishment now is
for you to have to live on.

440
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,756
Now, you listen to me.

441
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,594
I don't need your forgiveness
or your pity.

442
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:09,938
I only want you to kill...
to kill your and my enemy.

443
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:14,339
Voller.
It's Voller you've got to kill.

444
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,243
He kidnapped Debra.
He's a bloodthirsty madman...

445
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:20,874
...he wants the empire,
and I can't prevent it!

446
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,521
Only you can stop him now.
I'm afraid...

447
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:31,626
...afraid of what he might do to Debra.
You have to save her.

448
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,639
Since when have you been
working for McGowan?

449
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,705
Got to make a living.
You can let Debra go now.

450
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,712
The ransom money is here.

451
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,887
Don't tell me the old fool has forgot.

452
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,488
He was supposed to come and
pick up his pretty daughter.

453
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,190
- Not you.
- What's the difference?

454
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:20,396
What counts is that you get
your pot of gold...

455
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,602
...and that Debra returns to Suttonville.

456
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,342
Put down the gun as well.

457
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:32,208
Come on. It's like having
no britches on.

458
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,385
Let's take it rough.
I always stick to bargains.

459
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,753
Okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.

460
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,319
I'll let the girl go,
you get your ass away from my gold.

461
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,112
No!

462
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,356
Go on, now.

463
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,510
You don't know much about women,
do you, big boy?

464
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,377
Why did you have to get
mixed up in all this?

465
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,541
It's just a family affair.

466
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,122
Hey, Voller!

467
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,182
Ain't nothing but rocks!

468
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,130
He's right.

469
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,634
That paralytic old gold eater.

470
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,274
Don't be stupid. My father
would never cheat on a deal.

471
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,285
That's not a very nice thing
to do to me.

472
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,250
Take back the girl and
run off with my gold.

473
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,261
Where did you hide it?

474
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,439
You better kill me.
You better kill me while you can.

475
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,674
Or some day I'll get you.

476
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:56,385
Voller, I think I know how to
make him change his mind.

477
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,541
- The party's over!
- Bust the place apart!

478
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,361
Get out of here!

479
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,493
Let me go!

480
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,675
Angela!
Please, she hasn't done anything.

481
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,442
Johnny-Johnny!

482
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,825
What the hell have you done
to him, bastards?!

483
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,368
Hey, Pig-Sty!

484
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,009
Now look who we've got here.

485
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,378
Ain't she a pretty, little
sweetheart?

486
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:44,558
I only hope she can help you
bring back your memory.

487
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:53,697
Now, do you want to save
your hero or not?

488
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,568
Do you want to save him?

489
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:03,569
All you have to do is get him to say
where he has hidden my gold.

490
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,072
Leave her be.

491
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,476
I'll show you where I've hidden it.

492
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:15,581
But you have to let her go,
first, with a headstart.

493
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,425
All that's left is to say,
"Good-bye"...

494
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,090
...because he and I got another
score to settle, see?

495
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:26,727
Angela, get out of here.

496
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:32,772
No, I can't do it.
You're not going to die. You can't.

497
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,599
- Don't be a fool.
- No.

498
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,110
- If you stay, he will kill us both.
- No.

499
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,677
Now that poor Johnny is dead,
you're my whole world.

500
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,081
Okay, let's go.
We've wasted enough time already.

501
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,920
If she's so set on it,
she can come, too.

502
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:12,214
You saved us the trouble of
digging your grave.

503
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:15,572
See the sun?

504
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,644
That's gonna be your damnation.

505
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,982
I've reserved the slowest end for you,
my little heart could think of.

506
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,182
You trash.

507
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,158
You bastard!
I'll tear your eyes out!

508
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,327
Worthless whore.

509
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,931
God damn you. I'll kill you.

510
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:46,970
That will do.

511
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,517
Can't you close your eyes?

512
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,719
Then, golly, I just hope a
scorpion gets you...

513
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:03,890
...before the sun burns them out.
Adios, amigo.

514
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,188
Debra! Debra.

515
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,693
He'll tell you the whole story.

516
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,768
You're getting old, McGowan.
Finished.

517
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,236
Why don't you move over and
leave a place for me?

518
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,575
I want you to give your blessings
to our imminent betrothal.

519
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,780
If I ever get you out of there alive,
remember...

520
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,949
...Burt Craven never forgets.

521
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:49,198
Go on! They're all waiting.

522
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,645
There. Climb aboard.

523
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:08,650
Get going, and don't ever come back.

524
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,516
That's the way to clean up a town.

525
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,319
Now, it's time for a little
law and order in this place...

526
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:19,992
...seeing that both McGowan and I
feel it's necessary.

527
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:23,127
Now, owing to infirmity,
the old man desires that...

528
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,766
...I replace him in the management
of the mine...

529
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,333
...and the administration of Suttonville.

530
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:33,172
And I'd like to take this opportunity
to tell you all...

531
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,342
...Miss Debra and I are shortly
to be married.

532
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,883
Is it night yet?

533
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,996
No, it's still light outside.

534
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,233
I better go out there and hunt for
something to sink our teeth into...

535
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,069
...before it gets dark.

536
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,038
See what easy women do to you?

537
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,871
Turns you into softies.

538
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:55,207
What did I say? On your feet!
I said, "On your feet!"

539
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,376
Leave him alone,
son-of-a-bitch.

540
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:02,721
Now I got something to say.

541
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,519
Old McGowan was a hard man
to work under...

542
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,217
...but you've pushed it too far.

543
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,454
Are you out of your mind?
Put the shovel down.

544
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,329
Either you stop treating us
like a herd of animals or...

545
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:13,901
...you'll mine the silver yourself.

546
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:16,129
- Amen.
- You can't treat us like mules.

547
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,345
Let that be an example to you all.
Now get back to work!

548
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,851
Let's show him we ain't scared of him.
Come on!

549
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,688
This is your last warning.

550
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,693
We will not tolerate any further
insubordination, and...

551
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,233
...we do not accept any of your
requests or complaints.

552
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:28,934
Now either you all return to work
immediately...

553
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,169
...or I give the order to my men
to open fire on you.

554
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:36,107
Voller.

555
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,409
You won't gain any power
simply by forcing them.

556
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,147
Don't fire.

557
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:47,955
Fire!

558
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:06,794
I tried looking at daylight again today.
Nothing.

559
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,631
Don't worry, you'll get your sight back
even if it does take a long time.

560
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,473
Why is it you're playing
nursemaid?

561
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,474
You once saved my life,
don't you remember?

562
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,372
I also cut off your hand.

563
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,284
Yeah, well, now I've got one
made of steel...

564
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,376
...and twice as strong as before.

565
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,917
Anyhow, let's forget this goddamn
sad talk and drink up...

566
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,255
...and quit feeling sorry for yourself.

567
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,352
You know something?

568
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,298
It's a whole new world
when you go blind.

569
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,664
You see things
you never saw before.

570
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,002
We got to have the blasted horses
changed, right?

571
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,904
So, we wait in this dump.

572
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:42,642
How can you stand living in this
God-forsaken rathole?

573
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:46,779
Until a couple of weeks ago,
you couldn't even get whiskey here.

574
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:53,528
Hey, buck-a-roo. How about offering me
a little whiskey, huh?

575
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:59,026
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, it's awful.

576
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:02,201
I wasn't born with this goddamn hook.

577
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:04,765
A son-of-a-bitch hacked it off
with a hatchet.

578
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:07,865
I remember when you came in.
The man called Blade.

579
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,973
I don't think Blade will be chopping off
any more hands.

580
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,975
Oh, yeah?
Well, Blade is still alive.

581
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:18,947
He'll be back, looking for blood.

582
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,052
And where is he?

583
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:27,720
Right now, he's like a wounded animal,
but he's healing fast.

584
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,193
Answer my question.
Where is he?

585
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:36,361
Depends on how much
your boss wants to pay.

586
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,741
Now, I only wish I could be
with you for this.

587
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:54,588
These boys are the best.
If you're playing straight, they'll get him.

588
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:57,823
If not, you're gonna need at least
3 more hooks. Here.

589
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:02,085
You don't have to worry about a thing.
He's blind and unarmed. It'll be easy.

590
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,332
We'll be back tomorrow with
his head on a stick.

591
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,726
Okay fellas, go on.

592
01:25:56,818 --> 01:26:00,481
He's over there in that cave.
I'll wait here.

593
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:49,534
I can't see a damn thing in here.

594
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,196
You two go ahead.
We'll cover your backs.

595
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:55,038
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead.

596
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:42,941
Go on!

597
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,110
Go on!

598
01:29:57,558 --> 01:29:59,389
Where the hell are you,
you son-of-a-bitch?

599
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,227
Burt Craven, I know you're here.

600
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:48,334
You told me you were blind.
You said you couldn't look into the sun.

601
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:51,534
You bastard, you lied!

602
01:30:54,782 --> 01:31:00,448
Talking about seeing things different.
You were lying.

603
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:05,091
I was warning you about how I saw
through everything you were saying.

604
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:07,850
It's time. Draw!

605
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:12,697
Draw.

606
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:31,270
Voller! Where are you?
I've come to kill you.

607
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,082
I'm here for you.

608
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:01,964
Double or nothing.

609
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:08,302
Come on out. Show yourself,
if you got the guts.

610
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:10,637
I'm right here in front of you.

611
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,006
No!

612
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:54,076
No!

613
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:05,863
Hey, mister.

614
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:10,161
A couple of eggs
will go good on the trail.
