00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,079
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

2
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:02,808
Why do revenants always have to be such

3
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:05,383
a frigging hassle? He
attacked my home, Dolls.

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,335
A souvenir photo with my father's body.

5
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:09,921
<i>This is what Bobo's been
digging up half of Purgatory for.</i>

6
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:13,224
Oh, my God, it's a real dead guy.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,477
- I know what you really are.
- Competition.

8
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:17,345
<i>- The enemy.
- Nobody goes out there</i>

9
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:19,681
<i>- unless they really have to.
- Who is this person</i>

10
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:22,017
<i>nobody goes to see unless they have to?</i>

11
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,185
The Blacksmith.

12
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:26,655
She's gonna be coming for
me. I need to find some salt.

13
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,606
<i>Who's coming? Am I in danger?</i>

14
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:30,132
Of course you are.

15
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,039
Witch.

16
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:51,596
Well, shit.

17
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,515
John, John, John...

18
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:58,553
didn't I blow you up with a motorbike?

19
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,305
Yeah, well, it didn't take.

20
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:02,307
This one will.

21
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,563
Oh, you like to make an entrance.

22
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:10,982
Hey, Doc,

23
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:13,952
you want to tell me why
you're living in the woods,

24
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,988
screaming in your sleep and
being ambushed by revenants?

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,791
I had him right where I wanted him.

26
00:01:19,826 --> 00:01:21,409
On top of you?

27
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:28,083
If you are done your business,

28
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:30,051
I wouldn't mind getting
some shut-eye so...

29
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:33,171
Not done yet. I'm here on recon.

30
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:35,924
Johnny-Come-Twicely was a bonus.

31
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,896
Last of the Seven is too
blurry for me to make out,

32
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:43,982
but you knew Auggie so...

33
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:51,022
Wynonna, you wanna know why
I nearly got my throat slit?

34
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:54,075
Because I've been helping the heir.

35
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,777
You.

36
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:57,746
And I'm doing it for nothing.

37
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,701
It's funny, I thought you
were doing it for me.

38
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,700
I have my own devils to trap. So
unless we are gonna make this

39
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:04,869
a more equal partnership,

40
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,372
I must politely say, go to hell.

41
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:18,633
Oh, wake up.

42
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,857
I know you're here.

43
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,809
I can smell you.

44
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:30,478
Sure that's not your fear?

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,897
I'm...

46
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,533
positively choking on it.

47
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,652
I don't have what you want, Constance.

48
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,654
But you know where he is.

49
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,209
You touched him, Mattie.

50
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:49,497
As I've longed to touch him

51
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,333
for 130 years.

52
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,586
My beautiful boy.

53
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:56,971
I could you make you young again.

54
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,474
At a cost that would make a whore blush.

55
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:01,509
I can cure that tumour in your breast.

56
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:07,265
Now, that's just rude.

57
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,317
You want rude?

58
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,938
Cute.

59
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,741
But if you don't take the carrot,

60
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:19,777
you get the stick.

61
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,831
Where's my boy?

62
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,666
Ah! Ugh!

And he's living in a tent
a raccoon wouldn't piss on.

you're still working all weekend?

00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:02,787
OK. You're asking why?

75
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,290
- Just trying to keep up, right?
- We're gonna

76
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:08,326
track down the last of
the Seven if it kills me.

77
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,078
Hey, you want me to ask
him to run some tests

78
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,630
- on your bony little friend?
- Uh,

79
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,299
no.

80
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:15,979
Curtis left it to me,

81
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:18,670
and if I give it to Black
Badge, I might never see it again.

82
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,422
They say I have trust issues.

83
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:23,091
You're gonna be OK

84
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,059
- without me?
- I'm good.

85
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,061
I'm a happily single Virgo

86
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,347
- with hair for days.
- Well, you get lonely

87
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,267
- and you call me.
- OK. OK.

88
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:39,440
Why wouldn't Doc look at the photo?

89
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:43,328
Because he was drunk and ornery.

90
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,914
- More than usual.
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,667
Yes, we all know how
much you "mm-hmm" Doc.

92
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:52,203
Doc's the kind of bad that's
good to keep around.

93
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,372
Wynonna, you don't
become immortal by making deals

94
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,292
with angels. You gotta go
to the other guys for that.

95
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,012
There.

96
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,131
Look at this hand.

97
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,134
Well, looks like your seventh

98
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,469
was quite the gentleman.

99
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:10,471
Tell that to my dead sister.

100
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:16,060
Look. See? There's a... spade.

101
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,315
Nice work.

102
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,986
- You up for some Chinese?
- Yes!

103
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:26,738
- Put me down for...
- Gong Bao chicken

104
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,574
with enough hot sauce to
blind a T-Rex, right?

105
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:32,377
It's gonna be a long night,

106
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,330
- we should make it fun.
- Hmm.

107
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,799
'Cause fun's your middle name.

108
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:42,337
I give you this, Mattie,

109
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,255
you've lasted hours longer

110
00:05:44,307 --> 00:05:45,890
than I thought you would.

111
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,925
Maybe you've
underestimated the good that's left

112
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,428
in this world.

113
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
I highly doubt it.

114
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:55,850
You've done your
worst. I'm not coming out.

115
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,602
Are you sure?

116
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:01,856
Hagyd, hogy a torok porra

117
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,692
ahogy porra.

118
00:06:23,179 --> 00:06:25,013
Go on.

119
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,026
Now,

120
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,977
we can finally begin.

121
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,397
Tell me,

122
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,316
who has the skull?

123
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:47,568
The girl that's gonna

124
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,704
finally end you.

125
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:53,541
Wonderful!

126
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:55,626

Dare I ask?

133
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,140
My uncle Curtis left
it for me to look after.

134
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:56,719
Human remains, what every girl
wants in her inheritance, right?

135
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:09,982
I don't think this is
human. Best be careful

136
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:12,133
- who knows you have that.
- Why?

137
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,487
In Bobo Del Rey's camp,
there was two skeletons,

138
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:16,155
one of which was missing a head.

139
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:19,959
Great.

140
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,294
My parlay with Bobo has finished.

141
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,630
This morning, Wynonna, she requested

142
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:26,916
- assistance and...
- You told her to go to hell!

143
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,052
And it was wrong of me. Too much drink,

144
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,921
too much pride.

145
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:34,256
Hey, wait a second. I wanna record this,

146
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:36,759
so that I can replay it to
you when you're being a dick.

147
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:40,846
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

148
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:43,766
Your tele... telephone
is angry about something.

149
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:46,068
Yeah, you need to
go. Girls only tonight.

150
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:48,354
Engagement party. A
chance for me to show my friends

151
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:51,073
that I'm not a freak.

152
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,859
You hunt demonic
outlaws who rise from the dead.

153
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,911
Gunslingers cannot foster

154
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:59,198
friendships with
civilians, it never works.

155
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,200
See, you being here is definitely not

156
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:03,419
selling normal.

157
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:07,506
So look, the only
invitation you're getting

158
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:10,259
is to move onto our land.

159
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:14,296
What? Friends don't let
friends get gutted by revenants.

160
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,966
Plus, you know, it might be
nice for us to have some company.

161
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:18,968
You know, chop wood,

162
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,637
- help us not die.
- That is a generous offer,

163
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,556
one that should come
from your sister also.

164
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,608
Look, she might not be able

165
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:27,610
to figure you out, Doc,

166
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:30,563
but Wynonna doesn't want you dead.

167
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,234
Well, I will consider it.

168
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:38,037
I'll sleep in the barn
tonight and see if it meets my needs.

169
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:40,122
- Good.
- You should hide that cranium

170
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:42,291
somewhere safe. You wouldn't want

171
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:45,210
to spoil the revelry.

00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,778
Look, I need you to
stand by for instructions.

180
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,414
I may need you to
access my files quickly.

181
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,917
OK, this is supremely
cryptic, even for you.

182
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:27,036
<i>Look, you can do it,
Earp. You don't need me.</i>

183
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,088
OK? You can break the curse,

184
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,040
find the last of the Seven.

185
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,508
Believe that.

186
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,126
OK, Dolls,

187
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:36,545
do I need to send in the cavalry?

188
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:38,797
Say pomegranate if
someone's got a gun on you.

189
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:40,850
I owe you a nice dinner when I get back.

190
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,241
Double order of dumplings.

191
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:45,718
Dolls?

192
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,287
♪ Fly on your window I'm
just a fly on your wall ♪

193
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,957
♪ The way you chop off my wings ♪

194
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:08,210
♪ The way you swallow me
whole Way you follow my footsteps ♪

195
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:09,745
Welcome to the party!

196
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,964
Oh, Chrissy, Steph.

197
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,416
- Where is everybody?
- Hmmm...

198
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:16,338
♪ Guilt and shame douse me ♪

199
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:18,554
♪ In gasoline We got a bar ♪

200
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:20,589
Rach and Sonja bailed.

201
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:23,425
They were too freaked to
come to the "Murder House."

202
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:26,562
It's not a murder house, it's my home.

203
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:29,431
Murder house, murder home...

204
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:31,850
I'm kidding. It looks great.

205
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,852
Thanks.

206
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:36,772
We're just surprised you ended
up moving back in with Wynonna.

207
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:39,191
This doesn't seem healthy, Waves.

208
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:41,243
What? To put the past
to rest and move on?

209
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:43,112
Aren't you the ones who got me, like,

210
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:44,913
five Dr. Phil books?

211
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:46,615
See?

212
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,001
Look, it's cute. You know,

213
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:52,121
- shabby chic.
- I don't really care where we are

214
00:11:52,173 --> 00:11:54,173
as long as we're all together.

215
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,375
Here's to moving on.

216
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,544
- And Steph getting engaged.
- Yeah!

217
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:00,929
Again.

218
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:03,682
And to bargain-bin decorating. Ha!

219
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,768
You know? Haha!

220
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:19,031
Saturday night.

221
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,983
I'm the town pariah with
ten years of bad deeds

222
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:23,402
and social suicides to make up for,

223
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:26,655
- what's your excuse?
- Nedley.

224
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:29,575
Say no more. Bosses are the worst.

225
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:33,412
Also, I'm scared mine might be dead.

226
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,631
Oh, kidding.

227
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:39,134
Are you sure you're OK?

228
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:42,087
Mm-hmm.

229
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:47,476
At least I'm not the only one who
wasn't invited to the party.

230
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:49,762
Makes me feel better.

231
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:52,064
What party?

232
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:56,568
Très sparkly.

233
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,937
Right? Thank God he finally grew a pair

234
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,939
and got it back from his ex.

235
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,358
So, when are we going
shopping for the bridesmaids' dresses?

236
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,328
We already did. Thanks
giving weekend at the city.

237
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:08,163
Merlot, shopping, spa day.

238
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:10,082
It was fabulous!

239
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,034
- Oh.
- You've been so busy

240
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,753
- reconnecting with Wynonna.
- Ignoring your boyfriend...

241
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:17,256
No. No. Champ and I are,

242
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,042
- are over. For real this time.
- Good for you.

243
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,427
- Yeah, but Champ was so...
- What? Ignorant?

244
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:24,930
- Immature?
- Indulgent.

245
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:27,850
He loved you. I mean, I'm not trying

246
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:30,269
to be mean here, but there aren't
exactly a bunch of dudes

247
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:31,887
lined up waiting to date an Earp.

248
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:34,807
Well...

249
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,892
There's a man outside.

250
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:39,695
Like, a cute lumberjack, cowboy,

251
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,730
light-more-than-your-fire kind of man!

252
00:13:41,782 --> 00:13:43,782
You whore!

253
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:45,901
You got a stripper?!

254
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,786
Hey.

255
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,705
Don't be cross, I got wood.

256
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,040
- I'll bet you do.
- Just in time.

257
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:54,076
Come on in, honey.

258
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:56,378
You know
exactly who she invited too.

259
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:58,881
- Chrissy Nedley.
- What?! Sheriff's daughter?

260
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,500
Mm-hmm! And Stephanie Jones.

261
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:03,335
You know, one time,

262
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:05,337
Stephanie told me

263
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,639
that I should think about
getting a butt lift.

264
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:10,759
What?! Your ass is like...

265
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:13,428
- It's top shelf, man. It's top shelf.
- Thanks.

266
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:16,348
Have I pulled Waves too close?

267
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,600
You know, I think

268
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:20,402
that Waverly has

269
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:22,938
spent her whole life

270
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,075
tailoring who she is to
the people she's with.

271
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:28,461
She's only now just starting to

272
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:30,052
figure out what she really wants.

273
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,831
Dude, you're like a
walking bumper sticker.

274
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:36,034
Who's armed!

275
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:38,003
Waverly should be hanging out with you.

276
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:40,622
I agree.

277
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:43,959
Who's this?

278
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:45,627
Who's this lady?

279
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:47,429
That is

280
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:50,299
victim number 3.

281
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:52,267
Same guy killed 3 women?

282
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:54,019
Yeah, killing them was only the start.

283
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:57,022
Joyce Arbour.

284
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:59,474
She's 22. We found her

285
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,311
Wednesday morning, and the
cause of death appears to be

286
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,479
multiple lacerations, but of course,

287
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:07,449
the autopsy report is
practically illegible.

288
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:10,736
Dolls picked a great time to go AWOL.

289
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:18,460
Uh, I need to see the body.

290
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:28,136
So, is this strip poker?

291
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,505
I'm not shy.

292
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:33,175
- No, you're engaged.
- Maybe we can bet just pennies.

293
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:35,427
I think I'm more comfortable
with pennies.

294
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,646
Is it true that everybody has a tell?

295
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:40,182
Well, I most certainly do not.

296
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:42,267
Henry has the biggest tell of all.

297
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,736
You're bluffing.

298
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:47,272
- Wanna bet?
- I'll bet

299
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:49,364
that this is the lamest engagement
party in history.

300
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,998
Well, a hostess is
only as good as her company.

301
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:04,206
Pair of sevens.

302
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:07,843
Aces and eights.

303
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:10,045
Well, you best rebutton your blouse

304
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:12,931
'cause all the
heat's over here on my girl.

305
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:22,441
What was that?

306
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:34,703
Barn door's come open
is all. I'll see to it.

307
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:49,418
OK.

308
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,157
Give me a minute.

309
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:15,610
One second.

310
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,413
She's coming.

311
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,500
She's coming. I-I-I t-tried to...

312
00:17:21,535 --> 00:17:23,502
I'll have someone call a physician!

313
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:25,504
No, no, no.

314
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:27,205
This kind of wound won't heal.

315
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:29,124
I'm dead already, Holliday.

316
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:32,928
- Have we met?
- There isn't much time.

317
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:35,263
You know Constance Clootie,

318
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,215
someone called the Stone Witch?

319
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:39,551
I am familiar with her work.

320
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:42,270
Waverly Earp has something she desires.

321
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:43,939
Her boy.

322
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:46,942
The skull.

323
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,399
If she unites what was scattered,

324
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,318
she will

325
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
let the revenants of Wyatt Earp loose

326
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:00,789
and set them free

327
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:03,125
of the Ghost River Triangle.

328
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,794
She will kill the girl.

329
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:08,630
Come the Witching
Hour, Constance will be

330
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,999
- upon you.
- Oh, I'll be waiting for her.

331
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:12,968
No! She's too strong.

332
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:15,921
You must warn
Waverly, and you take her away.

333
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:18,723
You go!

334
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,842
I waited three lifetimes

335
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:23,595
dreaming of ways to kill that witch.

336
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:26,565
- There's only one way to do so.
- Well, you tell me.

337
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,601
First, I need your word.

338
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,270
That you will take
Waverly and you will flee.

339
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:33,822
Now.

340
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:36,324
You save your
vendetta for another night.

341
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,993
Oh, I so swear.

342
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:41,163
OK.

343
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:43,281
First,

344
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,251
you need to collect
what is of her flesh...

345
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:48,537
hair, blood.

346
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,704
Dipped in it,

347
00:18:49,756 --> 00:18:52,007
this gallows silk

348
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:55,093
will lessen her
powers. It will bind her.

349
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,762
But you need to be
patient when you hunt her.

350
00:18:57,798 --> 00:19:00,849
She's vulnerable only in the time

351
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,884
following the Witching Hour.

352
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,888
The Reckoning.

353
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:11,560
No.

354
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,817
Doc?

355
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:26,041
Oh, it ain't nothing but a north wind

356
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,076
and some sneaky whisky jacks.

357
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,162
Now, I believe

358
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:33,048
I was about to give your
friends a lesson in bluffing.

359
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:39,522
Ah, eww!

360
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:44,694
Yeah, they say you
get used to the smell.

361
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:47,697
I spent a summer's
probation on roadkill removal.

362
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,782
Pfft! This is nothing.

363
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:56,038
And here she is.

364
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,907
Joyce Arbour.

365
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:15,558
She kind of looks like you, Wynonna.

366
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:17,593
Jesus Christ! Who did this?

367
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,313
- Someone who knew what they're doing.
- Dude!

368
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:23,599
This is a morgue, wear
a bell or something, OK?

369
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,850
Sorry.

370
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:26,769
Once a ninja, always a ninja.

371
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,238
Plus I forget I'm wearing these
cotton balls for shoes.

372
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:32,358
They help absorb the smell.

373
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,610
But you two pretty
ladies don't care about that.

374
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:36,112
Um, I'm Dr. Reggie,

375
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:38,364
the unlucky SOB

376
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,333
who has to make sure the
dead don't rise again.

377
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:42,501
You suck at your job.

378
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:43,953
Uh, excuse me?

379
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:45,504
Never mind.

380
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,090
Did you do this autopsy report?

381
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:51,043
Uh... If I'd done this,

382
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:52,575
I wouldn't have misspelled "breasts."

383
00:20:52,597 --> 00:20:54,714
I can tell you something about the body.

384
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,766
Did my own examination.

385
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,968
Anything unusual or

386
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,103
creepy about the wounds

387
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:03,806
- or the way she died?
- Well, she died

388
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:06,809
because humans can't survive
when their organs are removed.

389
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:08,987
She was alive when he took them out?!

390
00:21:09,012 --> 00:21:09,696
Correct.

391
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,447
But the incision isn't what killed her.

392
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:13,899
He drugged her, hooked her up to an IV,

393
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:16,202
a blood bag, just like any surgeon would

394
00:21:16,237 --> 00:21:18,621
doing open heart or intestinal surgery.

395
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:21,624
But here is the uber-weird part,

396
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,460
the wounds were cauterized

397
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:26,462
as they were made.

398
00:21:26,497 --> 00:21:29,465
So he cut her open with something hot?

399
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,300
Like lightsaber hot.

400
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:35,838
Hellfire hot.

401
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:41,677
<i>I need your word</i>

402
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,679
<i>that you will take Waverly</i>

403
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:45,898
<i>and you will flee. Now.</i>

404
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:48,651
<i>You save the vendetta for another night.</i>

405
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:50,653
<i>Oh, I so swear.</i>

406
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:55,658
Woohoo!

407
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:04,367
Alright, so you remove the
organs if you're gonna

408
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:06,836
sell them on the black
market. Why would you

409
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:08,871
take 'em out and then put 'em back in?

410
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:11,424
Maybe somebody was
looking for something.

411
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:13,876
You keep looking at her neck.

412
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:16,178
Yeah, there's a welt.

413
00:22:16,214 --> 00:22:19,048
Dude, I saw on the photos
it's the shape of a spade,

414
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,350
like on a deck of cards.

415
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:23,719
Sweet crickets! I missed that entirely.

416
00:22:23,721 --> 00:22:25,721
What would cause that?

417
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:28,474
Well, she was hit by something
in the shape of a spade, right?

418
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:30,526
I mean, sure, yeah.

419
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,611
Or it could have
been prolonged pressure.

420
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:35,564
Did, uh, you study forensics?

421
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,156
Someone just went into the cooler.

422
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,409
You guys come alone?

423
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:47,949
I don't know, did we?

424
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:51,247
There are more than one way
of getting inside the cooler?

425
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:53,549
Uh, yeah. Rear exit.

426
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:56,585
Alright, I got it.

427
00:22:56,587 --> 00:22:58,587
Don't shoot me, Earp.

428
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,816
Nicole!

429
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:13,769
OK, I get it, right? MacGilly sent you.

430
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:16,489
Haze the new guy? Real original.

431
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,954
The door was locked, I couldn't get in.

432
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,926
Jesus, Wynonna.

433
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:45,301
I can't beg your forgiveness,

434
00:23:45,353 --> 00:23:48,938
but I can assure you the
best way to protect Waverly Earp

435
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,724
is to put that witch in the ground.

436
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,367
Did you make that cake?

437
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:03,319
Yeah, it was my
aunt's recipe and then...

438
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:06,539
What's upstairs? Wynonna's grow op?

439
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,707
- We don't go up there!
- Oh, geeze,

440
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,743
relax. Honestly, Waverly,

441
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:12,795
you've gotten so weird.

442
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,413
Sorry.

443
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,465
It's just, we use it for
storage, that's all.

444
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,134
Uh-huh? Whatever.

445
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:20,302
I'm gonna go bum a cigarette off Henry.

446
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:26,425
- Special delivery.
- Oh Em Gee, bitch!

447
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:28,928
- You did hire a stripper?!
- Uh, no,

448
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,764
- I-I just have a package.
- Is it a big package?

449
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:35,518
Woohoo!

450
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,020
Huh! Huh! Huh!

451
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:40,606
OK, Magic Mike,

452
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:43,492
- show us your moves.
- Hahaha! Take it off!

453
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,116
- Woo!
- Hahaha!

454
00:25:04,015 --> 00:25:06,048
I think he's local.

455
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:16,525
<i>This gallows silk</i>

456
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:19,228
<i>will lessen her powers. Bind her.</i>

457
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
<i>She's vulnerable</i>

458
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:24,400
<i>only in the time following
the Witching Hour.</i>

459
00:25:24,402 --> 00:25:26,902
Oh, I've waited long enough.

460
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,749
Ugh!

461
00:25:46,257 --> 00:25:48,591
Where is the skull, little girl?

462
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:53,231
- Put her down!
- That is not sexy,

463
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,200
Waverly!

464
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,408
Where's Chrissy?

465
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:13,302
So I guess this means you
got the promotion, Agent Lucado.

466
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,337
Sit down, Dolls.

467
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,431
Look, I know things have started slow.

468
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:30,936
But I've submitted dozens,
dozens of detailed reports.

469
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:33,905
Wherein we learn your only recruits are

470
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,775
a cocktail waitress and a criminal.

471
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,777
Yeah, and that criminal's Wynonna Earp.

472
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,495
"Give me three months," you said,

473
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,781
"and I'll deliver
evidence of a demon conspiracy

474
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,000
the likes of which Black
Badge has never seen."

475
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,035
Your three months are up,

476
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,454
and I've seen all of this before.

477
00:26:49,506 --> 00:26:51,540
- Sir, if I may...
- I have a follow-up

478
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:53,759
examination with the board.

479
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:57,179
I'll return later with your new orders

480
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:59,214
and deployment. You speak

481
00:26:59,266 --> 00:27:00,882
- Swedish, right?
- Look, I've got

482
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:03,552
specimens in the lab
right now. Human remains

483
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:05,637
that have been
mummified by revenant saliva.

484
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:09,941
And do we think they will
be any less disappointing?

485
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,655
Nobody keeps booze in here, Wynonna!

486
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,290
Except you.

487
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:27,242
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

488
00:27:27,294 --> 00:27:29,327
Yeah. Dry morgue air is
murder on the schnoz.

489
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:32,130
Bullshit! I think
somebody's trying to scare you,

490
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,082
toy with you. Why?

491
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:36,218
I picked up this
case, like, an hour ago,

492
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:38,170
- how could...
- It be connected to you?

493
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,672
Yeah, I would really like

494
00:27:40,674 --> 00:27:42,758
to know that too. People getting eaten

495
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,011
by something? Call
Wynonna. Guy gets murdered by a man

496
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:48,513
in a mirror? Yeah,
Wynonna to the rescue.

497
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:50,565
Black Badge specializes in cases

498
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,567
that are, uh,

499
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:54,820
too complex for rookie flatfoots,

500
00:27:54,855 --> 00:27:57,239
so it makes sense that
you're a bit confused.

501
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:59,658
- I'm not.
- Alternately...

502
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,695
I don't suppose you have
a deck of playing cards

503
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:05,664
in this utility belt, huh?

504
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:07,115
Excuse me?

505
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,167
How do I know you didn't double back

506
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:11,536
to mess with the
body? Yeah, you're awfully

507
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:14,005
interested in me and my
sister. Maybe I should be grilling

508
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,708
the shit out of you. Maybe
you're the crazy one.

509
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,710
You of all people should know better

510
00:28:18,712 --> 00:28:20,712
than to try to make
me question my sanity.

511
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:43,819
Hallgassa meg a szavaimat,

512
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:46,204
istenekaz emberek.

513
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,041
I just killed someone!

514
00:28:51,411 --> 00:28:53,328
It was him or you.

515
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
A foldrol

516
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:57,749
az eg a kovek.

517
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,917
What were you shooting at out there?

518
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:01,026
The Stone Witch.

519
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:03,138
The woman who made me what I am.

520
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:04,556
Constance Clootie?

521
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:06,508
Funny how the woman that
you were looking for

522
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,810
happens to find you. Here.

523
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:11,346
Your Murder House's reception is balls!

524
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:13,765
En vagyok a ko boszorkany.

525
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:16,017
En vagyok a feltamadas.

526
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:19,020
- After she made me ageless...
- Ageless?!

527
00:29:19,072 --> 00:29:21,490
She stuck me at the
bottom of an old well

528
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:23,692
- to spend my immortality...
- Immorta...?

529
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:25,139
Rotting in the ground. And then

530
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,578
Wynonna showed up to retrieve

531
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:29,531
Wyatt's gun and left me a rope dangling,

532
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:32,450
- and here I am.
- Dangling? Are you both high?

533
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:34,753
OK. Well, she might be able

534
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:36,872
to get onto our
land, but she's not coming

535
00:29:36,924 --> 00:29:39,040
into our house, unless we invite her.

536
00:29:39,092 --> 00:29:41,426
Hagyjuk ezeket,

537
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:43,545
mint lesben feltamadni

538
00:29:43,597 --> 00:29:46,548
Hozzam. Hogy nem.

539
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,301
You are just as mental as your sister!

540
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:50,635
Yes, OK! Stephanie,

541
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:53,021
you're right, it's
all true! I am a freak!

542
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:56,224
- Wynonna's a freak! Doc's a freak!
- Hey now!

543
00:29:56,276 --> 00:29:58,193
But I'm a freak who knows
that the most lethal place

544
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,645
to stab someone bigger
than you is through the ear.

545
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:02,251
Yes, I'm the freak who knows that

546
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:03,949
witches can't cross lines of salt,

547
00:30:03,984 --> 00:30:06,651
which is pretty handy
right now. And I'm the freak

548
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:08,703
who, six months ago, would have been

549
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,655
too polite to mention that

550
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:13,041
that big ole diamond on
your finger, not only

551
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:16,244
is it cubic zirconium,
but it is ugly as shit!

552
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,549
- You bitch!
- So for once in your life,

553
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:23,969
please, just be smarter than
you look and just shut up!

554
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:32,394
- What the hell now!
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

555
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:35,013
You can't kill him 'cause
he's already dead!

556
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:36,681
- Go out!
- Oh, my god!

557
00:30:42,522 --> 00:30:45,774
OK,
so she can make zombies.

558
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:49,027
Yeah, that's neat.

559
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,363
Wait, you said Bobo has two skeletons,

560
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:53,615
and the skull is part of one of them.

561
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,584
Oh, she's trying to resurrect them!

562
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,118
Where did you hide it?

563
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:58,727
No, I'm not supposed
to give it to anybody,

564
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:01,206
OK? Look, I'm its
keeper. It's somewhere safe.

565
00:31:01,258 --> 00:31:04,009
What a pity we can't say the
same thing about ourselves.

566
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:06,962
Screw you satanist party poopers!

567
00:31:07,014 --> 00:31:09,047
No, wait! Stephanie, don't!

568
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:17,806
- Steph, don't!
- It's too late.

569
00:31:17,858 --> 00:31:19,774
It's too late.

570
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,867
Christ, she got the lady blacksmith.

571
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,627
Oh, my god! And we gave her Steph.

572
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:40,662
That was unfortunate.

573
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:42,831
Alright. OK. Oh, God!

574
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:52,360
Dolls. Uh, shit's really
hit the fan. Prfft!

575
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,479
This last guy, the last of the Seven,

576
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:56,697
he's just... he's toying with me.

577
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:58,950
It's like when I'm in the presence

578
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,536
of his... work,

579
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:04,238
<i>it's just all goosebumps and nosebleeds,</i>

580
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,241
<i>and I could really
use your help right now.</i>

581
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:12,296
It's Wynonna by the way. Wynonna Earp.

582
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,252
Dolls! Are you OK?

583
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,671
Wave, Wave, slow down.

584
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:26,394
What do you mean, you killed a stripper?

585
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,396
- OK, Wynonna's on her way.
- Splendid!

586
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:30,398
How far do you think
we are from the jeep?

587
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,433
Too far. They'd be on us
as quick as devils on sin.

588
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:35,069
Dynamite. Now, in my
experience, dynamites solves all manners

589
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:37,071
of problems. They can't
kill us if they're in pieces.

590
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:39,023
Oh yeah, sure, sure,
dynamite. I'll just go get some

591
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:41,943
from the kitchen. No, Doc! These
things are under a spell,

592
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:44,078
OK? They're puppets, we
have to cut their strings.

593
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,113
Well, their puppet master is
a witch who will kill you,

594
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,949
soon as look at you or worse.

595
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:49,917
Doc, why did she give you immortality

596
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:52,170
- only to throw you down a well?
- I...

597
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:54,705
Oh, God! Ah!

598
00:32:54,757 --> 00:32:56,624
OK, we... Uh, we have

599
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:59,043
some coyote traps in the
attic, maybe some more shotgun shells.

600
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:02,013
Desperate times. You toss
them down to me, then you stay put.

601
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:03,931
We'll have a better
chance from higher ground.

602
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:06,017
- Doc.
- If they break through,

603
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:08,803
I'll be hot on the heels. Now get it!

604
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:10,688
OK.

605
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,280
OK.

606
00:33:38,134 --> 00:33:40,801
Oh, my God, Chrissy!

607
00:33:40,837 --> 00:33:42,920
I'm sorry. I know upstairs is off-limits.

608
00:33:42,972 --> 00:33:45,306
Dad always said, "Just
put as many people between you

609
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:48,009
and the intruders as you can."

610
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:50,094
I'm done with this.

611
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:52,179
This is Willa's room.

612
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:54,315
I mean,

613
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,317
- was, was Willa's room.
- I'm so sorry, Waves.

614
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:58,486
Did you call my dad? Did
you call the police?

615
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:00,488
Wynonna's on her way.

616
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:03,024
She's the best chance
we got. OK, just please,

617
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,109
please just trust me, Chrissy.

618
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,577
Geez.

619
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:08,446
OK, I do.

620
00:34:08,498 --> 00:34:10,615
I always have. Do you remember

621
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:11,919
that time when we were 12, and the boys,

622
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:13,308
they tried to lock me in the porta-potty?

623
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:15,202
And you, you took a
stick and you came out

624
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:17,672
and you started
whacking the leader in the balls.

625
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:19,790
Champ Hardy.

626
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:22,376
God, he was a dick and
three quarters back then.

627
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:25,012
You never stayed out of a fight, Waves.

628
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:27,431
You were the one who
always knew how to win it.

629
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,300
By any means necessary.

630
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,220
Willa would be really
proud of her little sister.

631
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:35,306
I know Wynonna is.

632
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,111
Stone Witch.

633
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,313
She's just another bully.

634
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:58,079
She said she's sorry she lied.

635
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:01,165
And then she just left out the window.

636
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:04,385
Chrissy, what was in the box?

637
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:12,259
Curious,

638
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:14,679
I gave them no command to spare you.

639
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:17,148
Give me my boy.

640
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,067
He's not just your boy anymore.

641
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:22,820
The Blacksmith bound him to me.

642
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:25,523
Clever.

643
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:28,442
But will he protect your friends?

644
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:30,995
What? No.

645
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,080
Wait, no.

646
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:35,499
All I wanna know is why you trapped Doc,

647
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:37,168
why you hate him.

648
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:39,203
Because he was loved

649
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:42,039
by Wyatt Earp, and Wyatt Earp

650
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:44,709
slaughtered my sons.

651
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:47,511
No, if Wyatt killed them, then
they would have resurrected

652
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:50,548
- like the other revenants.
- Revenants are human,

653
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,683
my boys were...

654
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:55,720
are something more.

655
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:00,358
That explains the overbite.

656
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:02,226
There's an evil in this world

657
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:04,195
far greater than your revenants,

658
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,197
Waverly Earp.

659
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:08,566
- It's coming.
- Yeah?

660
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:11,535
Well, then we'll stop it. OK?

661
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:14,572
Haven't you read a romance novel lately?

662
00:36:14,574 --> 00:36:16,907
Heroes always win.

663
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,793
Oh, you want to be a hero?

664
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:20,711
Very well, give me the skull

665
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:24,248
or I will take it from
your lifeless hands.

666
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,467
Come and get it.

667
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:29,503
- Aaah!
- Nooo!

668
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,474
You will die!

669
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:34,892
Someone will.

670
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,894
She's mine!

671
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,562
Oh!

672
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:44,769
Damn her to Hell and below.

673
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,527
Can you tell me what that was all about?

674
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,580
That was my Seven.

675
00:36:56,616 --> 00:36:59,867
And probably my greatest
chance of bringing her down.

676
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:02,953
You best see to your sister.

677
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:06,424
Wave.

678
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:09,460
Hey, you OK?

679
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:14,265
I'll never play piano again.

680
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,217
Do you play piano?

681
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,886
- No.
- No.

682
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:24,892
That was really brave.

683
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:27,945
Stupid

684
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,481
but very brave.

685
00:37:46,132 --> 00:37:48,716
I have something I need to say.

686
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,254
Mattie tried to warn
you, and you didn't listen.

687
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:56,223
Because you knew that if you told me

688
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:59,176
about Constance, I'd take the skull

689
00:37:59,228 --> 00:38:02,263
and leave. You used us as bait.

690
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:05,266
The witch is all I want in this world.

691
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:08,068
Thinking of her at the
end of a gun is the only thing

692
00:38:08,104 --> 00:38:10,070
that kept me alive in
that well. Kept me sane.

693
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:12,022
I'm starting to think

694
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:14,024
sanity's overrated.

695
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,660
See, whereas I underestimated...

696
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:20,865
I mean, I forgot

697
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,951
about the other stuff, the living stuff.

698
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:26,704
I understand if you hate me.

699
00:38:26,756 --> 00:38:28,873
I don't hate you, Doc.

700
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,877
You're the scorpion, I'm the frog.

701
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:34,962
I'm not sure I follow.

702
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,598
Just Google it.

703
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:40,518
I suppose this bears
repeating to Wynonna.

704
00:38:40,553 --> 00:38:42,353
At least, be man enough to tell her

705
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,138
yourself.

706
00:38:45,224 --> 00:38:46,974
You do love her after all.

707
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:50,060
Love?

708
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,279
Well, that's a bit rich.

709
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:54,315
There.

710
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,200
You wanted to know

711
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:57,902
what your tell at poker is?

712
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:00,905
Simple.

713
00:39:02,158 --> 00:39:04,325
You're always,

714
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:06,410
always lying.

715
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,433
Your sister OK?

716
00:39:29,485 --> 00:39:31,485
Yeah, well, she's being Waverly.

717
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,072
Yeah, well, Chrissy says
she scissored a stripper.

718
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,907
So?

719
00:39:36,943 --> 00:39:39,777
Any idea why your
homestead was targeted?

720
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:43,414
I mean, besides the
fact that it's yours.

721
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,302
You know what, we
should get some breakfast.

722
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:46,808
I could murder a sack of pancakes.

723
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:49,336
Then we'll talk, really talk.

724
00:39:49,372 --> 00:39:51,288
OK, you're gonna help me understand

725
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,841
why some of these cases
are a little too complex

726
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:56,126
for local flatfoots?

727
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,712
I'll do my best.

728
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:02,433
Your boss gonna be OK with that?

729
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:05,436
My boss isn't here.

730
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:08,305
- OK.
- Guess you're my ride.

731
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:22,486
- Come here, sweetie.
- Thanks, Waves.

732
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:24,288
Let's get you warm.

733
00:40:29,045 --> 00:40:30,544
- Eight hours!
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,630
Most people would have left.

735
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,632
Well, you should know by
now that I'm not most people.

736
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,750
Mm-hmm. As expected,

737
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,969
your samples didn't prove conclusively

738
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:40,921
there are demons in
Purgatory, and they sure as hell

739
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:42,806
don't prove the existence of revenants.

740
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:44,892
Yeah, If you knew what
we were dealing with...

741
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,477
Yes. If I knew.

742
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:49,647
But it seems you can't show me.

743
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:51,515
I'm shutting your division down.

744
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:54,852
We will of course have to
deal with your recruits.

745
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:58,238
Just how much intel have
they been privy to,

746
00:40:58,274 --> 00:41:01,241
- would you say?
- I have something else.

747
00:41:01,277 --> 00:41:03,827
- Dolls, enough!
- Not a revenant

748
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:05,696
or a demon.

749
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:13,010
- Never before documented.
- I'm listening.

750
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:42,809
Ah...

751
00:41:46,732 --> 00:41:48,281
<i>She's mine!</i>

752
00:41:48,317 --> 00:41:49,783
Oh!

753
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:52,235
Well, you learn something new every day.
