173
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:30,009
The, uh, Mayor asked me to
personally oversee the autopsy

174
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:31,478
and inform you of any results.

175
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:36,349
- Why?
- Well, apparently, Newett Energy's C.E.O.

176
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,351
called the Mayor's office this morning,

details were overlooked.</i>

Also wanted to make sure
no law-enforcement officials

jump to any costly
conclusions about liability.

180
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,562
I assume that means me.

181
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:52,615
Well, you do got a reputation
of being a Cheyenne advocate,

182
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,917
and you never really learned

183
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,282
how to properly oil
the haunches of power.

184
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:59,839
- What did you find?
- So far, nothing but trouble. [ spits ]

185
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:04,076
First of all, Ethan Lone Elk had
been painted red from head to toe.

186
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,463
Now, the paint fueled the fire
on his front, as you can see,

187
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:10,133
but his back was preserved,
most likely 'cause

188
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,685
he was lying down when
the blast occurred.

189
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,438
I took a sample of the
paint ... red, oil-based.

190
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:17,690
Here. 
I cut a swatch from his shirt.

191
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:23,446
And I hate racial stereotypes
as much as the next guy,

192
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,448
but it looks like he
was one drunk indian.

193
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:28,201
I swabbed inside his cheek.

194
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,956
Hardly seems official.

197

So, Deputy Moretti,
please do me a favor.

198
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:49,121
I want you to hold this mouthpiece
over Ethan's mouth just like so.

Now, on the count of three,

202
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:56,896
I want you to press down on
the victim's chest. Ready?

203

We didn't find any empty
beer bottles or cans,

00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,497
- anything at his house.
- So, Ethan was drinking.

210

why he was painted red

Nope. Walt wants us to go out.

He'll be gone when he's finished.

344
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:53,792
His arrest was fake. 
Ours was real.

<i>You know, there was a time
when you people at least tried</i>

346

00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:00,081
<i>Just how much money is
Newett Energy donating</i>

348
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,750

campaign anyway, Sheriff?

349
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:04,803
- Not a cent.
- Prove it.

350
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,588
- Ask my campaign manager.
- It is true. They are not donors.

351
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:14,778
Walt, we need to talk... 
you and me in private.

352
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:20,068
I just received the official
tox-screen report on Ethan Lone Elk.

353
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,488
It appears the explosion
didn't kill him.

354
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,106
He was already dead.

355
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,042
- How did he die?
- Acute alcohol poisoning.

356
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,713
- At 0.34?
- That came from his lungs.

357
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:36,360
but his blood test came back at 0.92 ...
more than 10 times the legal limit.

358
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:40,121
<i>I actually called to chew out the lab.
I thought the number was a typo.</i>

359

No one can drink that
much without passing out.

360
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,676
Someone was force-feeding
him the alcohol.

361
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:47,762
Any signs of bruising from
a fight, being tied up?

362
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:49,230
The burning and bubbling of the skin

363
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,732

364
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,567
This man was painted red

365
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,937
and forced to ingest alcohol
until his body shut down.

366
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,022
Pretty brutal death.

367
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,743
We might be looking at a hate
crime ... emphasis on hate.

368
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,079
You gonna tell the Mayor?

369

Oh. I get it.
Vic... I'd give you a kiss,

Newett Energy has been
targeting me for months.

389

Ethan died in a methane explosion

they thought he was me.

How do you know that?

Blood tests suggest alcohol
poisoning, and Ethan didn't drink.

His blood-alcohol level was 0.92.

That's enough to kill him.

He was painted red.
Someone targeted him.

432
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,030
They painted him red
because he wasn't red enough,

433
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:20,885
because he wasn't Indian enough,
because he chose a black woman.

Was anyone particularly
angry about that?

could have done this because of me?

It was not easy on him,

528
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:21,789
but I taught my sons never
to choose the easy path.

529

And you did a fine job with them.

530

It must have been 
even harder on Ethan

531
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:30,298
when he disqualified you
for failing the drug test.

532

This is a tribal elder

How hard was that on you, Mancell?

<i>When I failed that test,
I was angry and I was ashamed.</i>

537

What I should have been was proud.

538
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:55,156
I'd raised my two sons to follow truth

539
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,191

Where were you two nights

Ethan gave me that test.

You have no issue with
your son failing you?

546

Ethan didn't fail me. I failed him.

But you do have some
issues with his wife.

548

I choose not to recognize
that woman as Ethan's spouse!

549
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:36,230
- Because she's black.
- Because she's not Cheyenne.

When a child chooses to be with
someone you don't approve of,

- Yeah, for peyote ... that's no drug.

678
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:53,981
- That's our heritage.
- So, Ethan Lone Elk

679
00:38:53,982 --> 00:38:58,210
wouldn't cut you any slack for
observing sacred religious rituals?

680
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:03,298
Ethan was a self-righteous prick.
He came back here after 20 years,

681
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:08,169
started driving his whitman's car,
waving his white man's diploma,

682
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:10,505
showing off his black man's wife.

683
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:13,358
It was like suddenly, he
thought he was someone.

684
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,478
<i>He'd pull up over to Dolan's place,</i>

685
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:19,481
and we'd call him over,
invite him to a drink,

686
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,067
and he would just stand
there like he was afraid.

687
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:25,320
So you weren't too heartbroken
about what happened to Ethan.

688
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,489
Eh, he deserved what happened.

689
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:31,460
White man's company blows up
the whitest indian I ever seen.

690
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:34,195
What do you call that?
Poetic justice.

691
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:36,381
I'd call that something else.

692
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,585
See, Ethan was dead
before that house ignited,

693
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:42,337
and his body was covered in paint.

694
00:39:45,725 --> 00:39:49,177
Tuscan red ... it matches
the stripes on your car.

695
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,480
What, are you trying to
accuse us of something?

696

Here's what I got so far.

698
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:02,057
I think you asked
Ethan over for a drink.

699
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:05,060
But this time, you didn't
take "no" for an answer.

700
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:08,080
I think you grabbed Ethan
and dragged him over here,

701
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,232
held him down, and forced
booze down his throat

702
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:15,587
and painted him Tuscan
red just so he'd remember

703
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,040
no matter how many diplomas he had,

704
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,127
Ethan would always be
a red-skinned drunk.

00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:25,213
<i>After you forced him to
drink himself to death,</i>

706
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,582
<i>you took him to his brother's house.</i>

707
00:40:27,684 --> 00:40:30,636
You opened the taps, 
closed the doors,

708
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:35,090
and blew the place to bits
to cover up what you'd done ...

709
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:40,095
all because Ethan had
made himself into somebody.

710
00:40:40,196 --> 00:40:42,364
And you...

711
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,318

your blood is Tuscan red,

I'd think twice about that.

You know, I heard that
information I gave you

717
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:10,475
about the shade of house
paint actually came in handy.

718
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,178
Sorry, I forgot to
bring you your trophy.

719
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:16,398
Should I step out so you
can measure the blinds?

720
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,073
- So, Walt, how's Cady?
- Cady's fine.

721

That's funny, 'cause...
I don't think she is.

722
00:41:28,911 --> 00:41:33,532
I think she's feeling lost and alone.

723
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:37,152
And I think deep down, she's angry

724
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:41,123
<i>because she put her entire life on
hold for you when you needed her.</i>

turned and she needs you,

you're too busy being
Sheriff to even notice.

Not only do you think you'd
be a better Sheriff than me,

728
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,173
you think you can walk in here
and tell me how to be a father?

729
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:03,445
Walt, I know what happened in Denver.

No, you don't.

consider the idea that right now...

your daughter might need you
