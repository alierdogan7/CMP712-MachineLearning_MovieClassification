1
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,468
Hannah?

2
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,435
Gone again?

3
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,213
I declare, that girl takes special pride

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,046
in making herself scarce
when there's chores to be done.

5
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,779
I'll help you clear the table, Kate.

6
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,286
No, that's her job.

7
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,755
How's she ever gonna learn responsibility?

8
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,921
Caleb, round up your sister.

9
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,559
Hanny! Hanny!

10
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,827
He's never gonna find her.

11
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,968
She sure enough knows how to hide.

12
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,298
She gets that from your side, James.

13
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,500
Where are you?

14
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,232
Hanny!

15
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,035
You're gonna get in big trouble.

16
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,136
Where are you hiding?

17
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,682
Riders coming in.

18
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,690
Yeah. Get the kids in the house.

19
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,760
Caleb! Hannah! Come back here right now.

20
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:24,921
Get in there with them.

21
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,055
- What about Hannah?
- Get in there.

22
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,908
Evening.

23
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,410
You guys are in a powerful hurry.

24
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,676
Nice place.

25
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,781
Name's Beaumont.

26
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,588
My name's Frank McMurphy.
These are my men.

27
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,423
Yeah, that's right, you heard of me.

28
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,795
We need water, fresh horses.

29
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,733
Well, we got plenty of water,

30
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,377
but the horses ain't for sale.

31
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,276
Well... Nobody said anything
about buying, sodbuster.

32
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,052
We take what we need.

33
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,399
James.

34
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,466
Turk, Pineda, round up them horses.

35
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,679
Hacker, get that boy.

36
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,611
- Come on.
- Fellas, help him.

37
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,918
Come here boy.

38
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,067
Burn the house down.

39
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,567
Let's go.

40
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,405
Move your ass! We haven't got all day!

41
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,777
Come on.

42
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,520
Got you now.

43
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,694
Come out.

44
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,633
Where the hell are you?

45
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,671
Let him go.

46
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,354
I'm not a judge, or a jury

47
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,326
My job is to bring you in, see justice done.

48
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,587
Don't!

49
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,591
I need you alive, Turk.

50
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,281
What part of alive didn't you understand?

51
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,687
Quit your whining.

52
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,428
I didn't do nothing wrong.

53
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,781
Morning ladies.

54
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,732
Get your hands off me.

55
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,105
The lady said stop bothering her.

56
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,143
I warned you.

57
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,179
You know...

58
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,409
'Whoa there.

59
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,051
Hey, Hannah.

60
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,991
Wyatt Earp. Busy morning?

61
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,894
The usual. What you got for me today?

62
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,538
Turk Anderson.

63
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,240
$200, same bounty dead or alive.

64
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,677
Alive, as usual.

65
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,889
Wouldn't expect anything else.

66
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,084
Thanks.

67
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,924
Come on over to my office.

68
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,096
Come on, tough guy. Let's go.

69
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,064
Come on, come on.

70
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,938
Don't bother getting up.

71
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,341
Wasn't going to.

72
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,710
Beaumont, this your prisoner?

73
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,676
- He's mine.
- Mine's outside.

74
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,281
Who's watching him, his maker?

75
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,084
You know that's not how I work.

76
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,387
I know. Hannah Beaumont always brings
them in alive.

77
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,896
You know one of these days,

78
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,591
one of these range bums
isn't gonna give you a choice.

79
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,558
What are you gonna do then?

80
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,966
Put him in the ground.

81
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,303
When we gonna get some help
around here, Larry?

82
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,204
- We're doing fine.
- You mean I am.

83
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,177
-200.
- Thanks Wyatt.

84
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,102
Marshal.

85
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,118
Hannah, wait up.

86
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,794
Something wrong?

87
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,898
Yeah. No, I mean no.

88
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,866
Old Deger broke out my pay for the month,

89
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,138
and that's just about enough
for one steak dinner at Del Monaco's.

90
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,405
I'd be honored if you shared it with me.

91
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,004
Tempting, but I've been on the trail
for two weeks.

92
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,947
- I'm exhausted.
- Right.

93
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,053
Hey, another night, all right?

94
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,110
Yeah.

95
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,721
Yeah, you just let me know when.

96
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,194
Right, I better get back
before Old Deger hits one of the prisoners.

97
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,027
Morning. I'm Hannah. Who are you?

98
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,069
I know.

99
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,872
Don't seem like it, but it will pass.

100
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,181
Miss Beaumont?

101
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,909
Morning Mattie.

102
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,485
Miss Beaumont.

103
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,757
You've met Elizabeth.
She just joined us today.

104
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,486
Go play with the other girls, dear.

105
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,163
Elizabeth Johnson, she lost her whole family
in an Indian raid.

106
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,033
Army scouts found her two days later.

107
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,199
She'll get over it.

108
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,194
Here.

109
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,771
You keep us going.

110
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,572
Just keep up the good work, Mattie.

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,502
And keep my name out of it.

112
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,813
Of course.
God must have truly sent you to us.

113
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,644
God had nothing to do with it.

114
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,386
See ya, Elizabeth.

115
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,212
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, Mary.

116
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,217
Got about 100 miles of trail dust in my craw.

117
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,825
One drink?

118
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,658
- I'll watch ya.
- Come on in.

119
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,101
Set me up, Andy.

120
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,773
What's in the box?

121
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:11,864
Present.

122
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,606
Who gave it to you?

123
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,873
No, giving it.

124
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,913
To you.

125
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,538
I don't...

126
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,213
I didn't ask for anything.

127
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,685
I know. Open it.

128
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,700
It's the same one we saw
in that Marshall <i>Field</i> catalog from Chicago.

129
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,172
Thank you,

130
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:54,378
but I don't have any call for an outfit like this.

131
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,977
Well, you might.

132
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,921
Someone asks you out to dinner.

133
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,794
He already asked you.

134
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:12,268
Damn, that boy is impatient.
I told him to wait till I got back in town.

135
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,598
You knew?

136
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,866
- He asked me for some advice.
- And what did you tell him?

137
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:22,509
I told him, nobody in this town
knows Hannah Beaumont better than me.

138
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,979
And I know it all.

139
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,680
When y'all going out?

140
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,120
I said no.

141
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,117
What?

142
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,859
You crazy.

143
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,132
That Wyatt Earp is a fine man,

144
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,260
the finest thing to come through
this hell hole in I don't know how long.

145
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,530
I know.

146
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,165
- Then what?
- You're right, he's a great guy,

147
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,736
good looking, honest,

148
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,706
he loves the law. l just don't have

149
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,642
room.

150
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,986
No, it ain't healthy,

151
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,255
you spending every night alone like that.

152
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,191
You don't have anyone.

153
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,526
I don't worry about that.

154
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:13,857
Your religious schooling?

155
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,729
No, convent is a distant memory.

156
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,665
Besides, I do have someone special
in my life.

157
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,763
What's his name?

158
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,068
Greener.

159
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,805
My double barrel Greener lover
is always by my side.

160
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,038
Ya damn cheat!

161
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,380


162
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:41,815
I'm sorry, where I come from winning is not
always an indication of cheating.

163
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,356
What are you calling me?

164
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,089
Well, nothing yet.

165
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,227
Trying to formulate, that is,

166
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:54,130
put together, a sentence
with words you might understand.

167
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,736
Smart-ass lunger.

168
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,511
Your hardware don't impress me.

169
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,008
- Oh my.
- Yeah.

170
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,808
Well then fill your hand.

171
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,495
Now, Walter, this is ridiculous.

172
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:31,035
I have no interest in winning a game
that's had a shadow cast upon it.

173
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,470
You don't trust me,
most assuredly, I don't trust you.

174
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,645
What are we gonna do about it?

175
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,509
We'll cut for it.

176
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,683
Cut?

177
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,748
High card takes the pot.

178
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,315
Just the three of us,
yourself, myself, and lady luck.

179
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,387
No chance of cheating by either party.

180
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,160
No funny business.

181
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,826
What you got?

182
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,440
It's your lucky day, Walter,

183
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,740
it's all yours.

184
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,450
Wonderful playing with you.

185
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,795
Ain't that a daisy?

186
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,170
You don't worry.

187
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,072
You don't worry about Doc, Hannah,
he don't need your help.

188
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,002
What about Wyatt?

189
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,041
He's a good man.

190
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,508
Besides, you need to go out with him.

191
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,347
And why's that?

192
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,886
Because I bought that dress.

193
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,352
I'll pay you back.

194
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,788
You know how you can pay me back?

195
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,017
By going out to dinner with him.

196
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,561
Okay. If it's that important to you.

197
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,262
It is.

198
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,036
Thank you.

199
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,477
You have a good night, Hannah.

200
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,478
- Miss Beaumont.
- Doc.

201
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,888
You're gonna get yourself killed
one of these days.

202
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,557
When?

203
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,530
When?

204
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,906
Six to go.

205
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,190
Some fellas just don't know
what's good for them.

206
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,954
What are you staring at?

207
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,226
Quit your lollygagging!

208
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:17,227
Bring me those irons
so I can change these brands!

209
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,768
Get 'em in, get 'em in.

210
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,497
Should have been out of here an hour ago.

211
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,198
Here comes Hacker.

212
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,900
Must be feeding time.

213
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,269
Fresh. He's been shot.

214
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,047
Yeah, I just shot him.

215
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,246
No, not him, Turk.

216
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,912
Where?

217
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,780
In the arm, I think.

218
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,723
I meant, where did this take place?

219
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,287
- Dodge.
- Is he dead?

220
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,860
- Jail.
- Too bad.

221
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,526
Who did it?

222
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,866
Some bounty hunter, but that's not the point.

223
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,269
What is the point?

224
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,876
It's the same bounty hunter who got
Ike Jefferson two months ago in Hays,

225
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,941
and Chino before that
in Blackwell, Oklahoma.

226
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,811
I'd like to meet this man.

227
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,387
It ain't no man.

228
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,397
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Good morning, Hannah.

229
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,968
How's my prisoner doing?

230
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,629
Hasn't stopped complaining.

231
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,834
Are those new?

232
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,934
Yeah, I was just about to bring you
your copies.

233
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,502
Three new handbills came in
on the train, no one special.

234
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,845
Listen, if I was too forward the other night...

235
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,913
No, you were a complete gentleman
I was just tired.

236
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,820
Is that offer still good?

237
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,658
Tomorrow night okay?

238
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,723
Come for you at 7:00.

239
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,428
Great.

240
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,168
That first one is Billy Lane.

241
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,575
Henry Underwood was riding
with Sam Bass' gang

242
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,876
until the rangers chased him
all the way across north Texas.

243
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,184
What is it? lsom Dart?

244
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,946
Wanted for murder in Wyoming, yeah.

245
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,123
Got a wire on him,
he's supposed to be in this territory.

246
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,894
Do you know him?

247
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,227
No, just another wanted man.

248
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,993
Not for long if you're after him
I'll see you tomorrow at 7:00.

249
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,931
7:00.

250
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,847
I love this town, Lauren. Even At night.

251
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,452
Especially at night.

252
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:04,232
Working man goes to sleep,
this town still thrives, I love that.

253
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,064
Where are my cattle?

254
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,771
Half the contracted amount
are in the stockyards now.

255
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,534
McMurphy's wire said a week for the balance.

256
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,868
Well you wire him back,

257
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,436
and you tell him the rest of my cattle
ain't in my yard,

258
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,709
it'll be McMurphy going to market.

259
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,579
Yes, sir.

260
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,595
Stitch.

261
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,431
Frank.

262
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,734
What's so all powerful important?

263
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,571
Still hunting bounty?

264
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,133
Yeah.

265
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,807
It's a good way to stay in touch
with old friends.

266
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,481
Hear you're a legitimate business man now.

267
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,451
Cattle, huh?

268
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,249
Yeah. West needs beef.

269
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,784
Anyone's beef?

270
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,818
Nobody cares once it's on their plate.

271
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,521
So why'd you send for me?

272
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,028
Bounty hunter's name.

273
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,840
Beaumont, Hannah Beaumont.

274
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,675
I heard of her.

275
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,210
Well, she's heard of us.

276
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,908
She put away three of the old gang
in the last six months.

277
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,373
Damn.

278
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,951
What have you heard about her?

279
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,917
Works out of Dodge City, Kansas.
Works alone.

280
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,546
That's all?

281
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:40,291
No, she was raised by an old black bounty
hunter, name of lsom Dart.

282
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,363
Good news is,

283
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,469
he's run afoul of the law,
and he's got a bounty on his own head.

284
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,038
'Well, how the hell is that good news for me?

285
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,978
Well, what do you do when
cockroaches get in the woodwork?

286
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,572
Smoke them out.

287
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,577
Dart's in trouble,

288
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,644
he'll most likely be headed
for the Beaumont woman.

289
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:08,452
If I ride into Dodge looking to collect
the bounty on her old friend,

290
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,224
that'll smoke her out.

291
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,332
Well, we'll just see how good she is.

292
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,477
Don't laugh.

293
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,393
Damn, you look good.

294
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,921
Don't get used to it.
This is extremely uncomfortable.

295
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,508
- You all right?
- My shoulders are cold.

296
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,635
- You want my coat?
- No, I'll be fine.

297
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,008
What were you saying?

298
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,505
Just Marshal Deger ain't gonna live forever.

299
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,048
Not the way he eats.

300
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,546
Yeah.

301
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:14,546
Someday, and maybe someday soon,
I'm gonna be the marshal of this town.

302
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,384
Now it pays $80 a month being head marshal.

303
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,625
All right, I know that doesn't sound like a lot,
but I got it all figured out, so.

304
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,339
So I'm gonna save up enough money,
get me a private train,

305
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,446
yeah, yeah, I'll ride it
right across the country,

306
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,415
stopping in all the big cities,
every big city with a circus,

307
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,418
and I'll buy up every elephant they have,

308
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,114
and I'll put them on
special made elephant freight cars,

309
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,178
and fill the coal tender right up with peanuts.

310
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,789
What do you think about that, Hannah?

311
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,560
That's nice.

312
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,358
Wait, what?

313
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,995
You weren't listening to me.

314
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:01,570
I'm sorry,
I'm just thinking about some things.

315
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,798
I can tell.

316
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,703
Maybe it would help if you talked about it.

317
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,839
Talking won't solve this kind of problem.

318
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:17,183
Hannah, you gotta know there's a lot
of questions I'd like to ask you, but I don't.

319
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,549
I appreciate that.

320
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,889
Part of me thinks
the answers wouldn't be enough.

321
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,862
I have a feeling it'd be like
looking into a well.

322
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,223
You know, you think
you've reached the bottom,

323
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,928
but there's always more,

324
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,403
more than you can see.

325
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:52,181
Well, don't lose hope. Keep looking.

326
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,160
Oh, my Lord.

327
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,597
Wyatt?

328
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,403
Stitch.

329
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,770
You know him?

330
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:16,136
Zechariah Stitch, ma'am.

331
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,644
We hunted buffalo with Bill
and Ed Masterson, a few years back.

332
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,783
Well, I'm after bigger game now.

333
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,879
This unfortunate fellow was wanted.

334
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,723
- Sure is. Was.

335
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,858
Saw a handbill on him about a week ago.

336
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,434
What's wrong little lady,
you've never seen a dead man before?

337
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,064
This is no lady, Stitch.
I mean, she has seen a dead body.

338
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,736
This is Hannah, Hannah Beaumont.

339
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,569
I heard of you.

340
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:55,711
You are the lady bounty hunter
that always brings them in alive.

341
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,783
Well I heard of you, Stitch.

342
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,689
You prefer to bring them in dead
isn't that right?

343
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,924
Well, you don't have to feed them,
you don't have to give them water,

344
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,897
all you have to do is sling them over
your saddle and ride them in.

345
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:13,062
Stitch, I'm the law here now,
you can't go heeled in this part of town.

346
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,663
- Even for old friends?
- I can't play favorites.

347
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,369
Now, I don't need any trouble from you.

348
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,136
I don't intend to cause any.

349
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,644
I'll keep this smoke wagon sheathed.

350
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,145
As for you, I heard you're pretty good,

351
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,885
and I don't mean to ride herd over
that type of bragging.

352
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,621
But listen up, little lady bounty hunter,

353
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,393
while I'm in Dodge,
I don't intend for you or anybody else

354
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:44,892
get in the way between any hombre
I've set my sights on.

355
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,332
That's enough, okay?

356
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,539
Who are you after?

357
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,775
I'm here to put a bullet in a murderer,

358
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,813
name of lsom Dart.

359
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,080
You don't care if it's in the front or the back.

360
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,660
Hannah, wait up. Hannah!

361
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:16,325
You know I can't abide killing,
even a wanted man.

362
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,889
Hannah, I know, but l just gotta say,

363
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,062
looking at the collection of drovers
and renegades you've brought in alive,

364
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,932
well, most of them look like
they might have needed some killing.

365
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,100
Justice ain't mine to give.

366
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,610
Here I am telling you.

367
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,810
I notice you only draw that pistol
to give polecats a knock on the head.

368
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,710
Well, bullets ain't cheap.

369
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,214
Especially when you're saving up
to buy elephants.

370
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,520
You have any idea
how much peanuts will cost, alone?

371
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,554
What are you gonna do?

372
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,102
First light I'm gonna go after
this lsom Dart character,

373
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,468
and bring him in, alive.

374
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,178
Dressed for the ball?

375
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:15,855
It is nearly midnight.

376
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,699
Jack of clubs on the queen of diamonds.

377
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,841
Well thank you, darling.

378
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,920
Good morning.

379
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,250
Morning.

380
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,615
Getting an early start?

381
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,662
Allow me.

382
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,709
- Listen, Doc...
- There's no need to say it.

383
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:50,241
As a man who has lived a life of regrets,
I know that look.

384
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:56,121
It's just, I'm going off to do
a distasteful thing.

385
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,486
Another distasteful thing?

386
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,159
There's nothing you have to say,

387
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,636
and there's nothing I have to say
about anything.

388
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,266
All right?

389
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,608
Thanks.

390
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,143
Now...

391
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,779
As you may have discerned,

392
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:28,988
I'm also an expert
in the area of distasteful things.

393
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,754
Is there no place for me in this game
of yours today?

394
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,730
Perhaps you could deal me in.

395
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,300
No seat at this table.

396
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,303
This, us.

397
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,571
This was just a hand.

398
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,845
Hannah.

399
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,007
What are you doing here?

400
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,680
I'm thinking I should be asking you that.
I'm waiting on you.

401
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,745
Waiting on you to come out your room.

402
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,725
Mary, please, not today, not now.

403
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,317
Nice dress.

404
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,864
Hannah, I'm your friend.

405
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,194
I know you are.

406
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,530
Friends are allowed to tell each other

407
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,661
when they've done
something incredibly stupid.

408
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,730
I didn't do anything
that's anyone else's business.

409
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,367
- Hannah.
- I said it wasn't anyone else's business.

410
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,371
What about Wyatt?

411
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,545
Especially not his business.

412
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,076
Well, I ain't gonna preach.

413
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,947
Thanks.

414
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,557
But I got to tell you,

415
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:38,924
to do something like this, when you just
starting out something good with Wyatt.

416
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,859
Don't you think I want those things?

417
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,005
Someone to love, family.

418
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,070
Maybe I don't deserve them,
you ever thought of that?

419
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,373
Maybe you don't think you do.

420
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,105
I know I don't.

421
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,814
Sermon over?

422
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,145
Yeah.

423
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,116
What are you all dressed for?
You going somewhere?

424
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,219
Riding into the hills with ya.

425
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,987
I don't want you riding out there.

426
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,325
I owe ya.

427
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,192
For what?

428
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,927
Saving my life.

429
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,264
When?

430
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,971
When I moved here.

431
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,947
You became my friend.

432
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,984
Folks in this town
didn't even want to look at me.

433
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,917
I don't think I would have made it this long
without you.

434
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,983
And I don't take friendship lightly.

435
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,160
Thank you,

436
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,125
but I have to do this alone.

437
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,233
Right.

438
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,993
I thought you said
you were gonna keep that sheathed?

439
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,469
Deputy Earp-

440
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:31,705
Can't fault a man when he hears footsteps
coming up from behind him.

441
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:35,971
Can I help you?

442
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,238
In fact you can.

443
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,147
You know I'm always one to go out of my way
to be helpful to the law.

444
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,520
Now, we both know that ain't true.

445
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,515
What do you want then?

446
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,959
You're riding out.

447
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,923
I got a line on Dart.

448
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,400
I hear he's holed up west of the wash

449
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,666
so I figured I'd round up his hide
before the sun sets.

450
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,164
I have a different idea.

451
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,073
Why don't you ride on east
until you hit New Orleans.

452
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,908
You'll probably make it there
just in time for Mardi Gras.

453
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,107
Deputy, that does sound like fun.

454
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,182
A little crawfish, a little jambalaya.

455
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,989
But also, that sounds like
you're asking me to leave town.

456
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,715
'Well your ears work just fine.

457
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,349
But my work here isn't done.

458
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,859
It is.

459
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,865
Do you want me to lose my bounty?
Is that it?

460
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,665
I don't want any trouble.

461
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,395
Well, I don't want any trouble from you.

462
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,697
From Hannah.

463
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,339
Well, what business is she to you?

464
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,972
You say you're here for Dart?

465
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,176
I can tell there's gonna be trouble
between you two.

466
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,648
Well, if she wants to make some,
I'm not backing down.

467
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,909
You don't understand.

468
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,788
If you hurt her, I will track you down,
and I will kill you.

469
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,325
That talk don't fit that badge, boy.

470
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,624
Try me.

471
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,065
See how fast I throw it away.

472
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,044
Hannah, you think
you could get away with it?

473
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,245
Wyatt, I...

474
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,516
Just sneak out of town
without saying goodbye?

475
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,326
Yeah, I told you I'd be setting out early.

476
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,355
It's a nice day for a ride
I thought I'd tag along.

477
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,296
That's mighty obliging,
but I don't need a posse.

478
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,096
I'll be tracking, and I do that better alone.

479
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,968
I was thinking, Hannah,

480
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,933
maybe you should let someone else
take this one.

481
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:46,497
Stitch, the back shooter?

482
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,170
'Why are you so hell-bent
on going after this man?

483
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,973
There's something you're not telling me.

484
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,379
I told you everything you need to know,
just leave me be.

485
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,884
Yeah, just remember,

486
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,845
sometimes no matter how strong
a person thinks they might be,

487
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,414
there comes a time when they need
someone to back them up.

488
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,156
When that time comes, Wyatt,
I'm glad to know I can count on you.

489
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,561
This just isn't that time.

490
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,847
You see what he did?

491
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,110
He walked his horse through here backward.

492
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,016
He's good.

493
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,622
I'm better.

494
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,272
Trained you good.

495
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,105
Want some coffee?

496
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,078
There's people looking for you
all over the territory.

497
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,923
You should be running a cold camp.

498
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,654
I knew you'd come looking for me.

499
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,159
How'd you get your picture
on that poster, lsom?

500
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,525
I thought you were smarter than that.

501
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,062
Funny story.

502
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,228
Funny if you're telling it,
not if you're living it.

503
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,176
I came across an overturned buckboard,

504
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,414
man was trapped under the wheel,
hurt real bad.

505
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,818
I put him on one of those horses
and run him back into the nearest town.

506
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,225
Never could make coffee
as good as you could.

507
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,531
The story?

508
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,402
I don't see how all this ends up
with you wanted.

509
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,541
Well it turns out,

510
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,935
it was the town sheriff,

511
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,778
on the trail of bank robbers.

512
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,882
When he died,
the town people decided that I did him in.

513
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,781
Idiots.

514
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,987
If I had killed a man,

515
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,222
why would I have brought him
back into town?

516
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,584
You tell them that?

517
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,426
I tried to.

518
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,558
Sounds like a case of them
reading the wrong brand.

519
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,930
Come in with me.

520
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,100
Tell your story and be tried.

521
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,641
They don't try black men
Hannah, you know that.

522
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:51,840
They hang them.

523
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,213
And so,

524
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:00,120
I'm gonna pick up my rifle,

525
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,051
get on my horse,

526
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,955
and get right out of here.

527
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:13,096
If you wanna stop me,
you best shoot me right now.

528
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,934
I was just kidding.

529
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,201
It wasn't me.

530
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,842
I told you I wasn't the only one
looking for you.

531
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,080
Who is it?

532
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,148
Bounty hunter named Stitch.

533
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:33,648
Is he good?

534
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,053
Not good enough to track you.

535
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,786
Yeah, just good enough to follow you.

536
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,457
At least he's a good shot.

537
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,692
A buffalo hunter.

538
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,529
Perfect, long range marksman.

539
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,734
He could wait us out. What's your out?

540
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,333
You picked a nice place to make a campsite.

541
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,305
So what do you say we do now?

542
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,743
I know what he'll do.

543
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,018
Wait until it gets dark, move in,
and kill both of us, get the reward.

544
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,803
Got a toothache, Wyatt?
Take a seat, I'm on a roll.

545
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,378
I'll never be drunk enough
to let you touch my teeth.

546
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,539
Well, I'm drunk enough.

547
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,113
Now, really Wyatt,
you must believe me when I tell you

548
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,125
that I was quite a good dentist
back in Atlanta.

549
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,525
We ain't in Atlanta, John Henry.

550
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,665
This isn't up to your usual level of banter.

551
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:55,963
Something's bothering you.

552
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,674
Hannah, you're worried about her.

553
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,069
Never did that before.

554
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,140
There's something personal in this.

555
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,109
That makes it dangerous.

556
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,082
I don't understand that woman.

557
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,352
I do.

558
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,059
I think I know her like I know myself.

559
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,969
I think personal is all she has.

560
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,775
Shucks. This remind you of anything?

561
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:44,484
New Mexico, Jesse Evans and the boys.

562
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,985
- Dumbest...
- Yeah.

563
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,752
Dumbest outlaws to ever draw a breath.

564
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,084
Had us dead to rights.

565
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,993
But we got out of it.

566
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:59,467
- We always came out on top.
- Yeah.

567
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,095
Why'd we stop?

568
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,607
I wonder how long he's gonna wait
before he moves in here.

569
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,743
Answer my question.

570
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,675
One day you just up and said,
"You're on your own now, girl."

571
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,348
Why?

572
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,026
'When I met you,
you were fresh out of the orphanage.

573
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,759
You saved my life.

574
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,891
Yeah, you asked me
to teach you to hunt men.

575
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,366
And I did it. You didn't need me anymore.

576
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:37,797
Bull.

577
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,535
Look...

578
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,041
Okay, look Hanny.

579
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,277
You're like a daughter to me.

580
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,283
And this quest for revenge

581
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:57,223
of yours was bound to get you killed
one day,

582
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,755
and I didn't want to be there
and see it happen.

583
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,554
It hasn't yet.

584
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,961
That's just lucky.

585
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,597
Maybe your luck's run out.

586
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,776
Maybe not. You stay here.

587
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,008
Where you going?

588
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,338
I told you to stay out of my way.

589
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,409
You shoot first.
You're as bad as the men we hunt.

590
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:52,139
No, they're bad. They're wanted.

591
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:09,462
What are you gonna do now,
little miss bring 'em in alive?

592
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,794
You gonna shoot me?

593
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,446
That's $500 just riding away!

594
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:32,544
What the hell does an outlaw
mean to you anyway?

595
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,782
He's just a damn...

596
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,391
He's better than you.

597
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,442
Get down to King's
and get me two boxes of 44.

598
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,203
What is this?

599
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,715
- He tried to kill me.
- She got in my way.

600
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,243
You...

601
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,483
What are you so all fired happy about?

602
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,550
Well, Wyatt, I'll be out of here soon enough.

603
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,756
To hang from a rope.

604
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,491
I don't think so.

605
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:18,957
You just don't get it, girl.

606
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,602
All of this

607
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,866
I was just sent to deliver you a message.

608
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,238
And what's the message?

609
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,411
He's coming.

610
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,104
Who?

611
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:40,119
Here's the thing, you've been doing a fine job
of picking us off one by one, little girl,

612
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,651
but he ain't coming alone.

613
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,925
He's got himself a new gang,

614
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,725
killers wanted from Colorado,
all the way to Saint Louis.

615
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,864
And he's coming for you.

616
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:52,923
Who?

617
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,162
Frank McMurphy.

618
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,170
In two days, he'll be riding into Dodge.

619
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,009
He's coming for you.

620
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,080
Let him come.

621
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,482
He's coming for you.

622
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:26,935
Twelve hired men,
and Lockwood wants to see you.

623
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,336
Yeah, that's what he said.

624
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,337
What are they after you for?

625
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,036
I guess because I brought in
three of his gang.

626
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,670
'Well, we'll just have to get
the whole town to join in.

627
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,578
Send those polecats
back where they came from.

628
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:44,244
Now, you know the folks in this town
ain't gonna risk their necks for nobody.

629
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:47,345
I can't ask anybody
to do that for me, anyway.

630
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:48,884
It's my fight.

631
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,926
I am the law now, remember, that's our job.

632
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,389
I didn't get your opinion.

633
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:03,870
Yes, he who runs away lives...

634
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,134
Well, lives.

635
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,506
So you're not volunteering to help?

636
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,346
I do not like the odds.

637
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,186
I'll go talk to Deger.

638
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:26,693
- It's time I go see Lockwood.
- Lockwood.

639
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,497
You're making the big-time, girl.

640
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,902
- I'll see you both later.
- Unless you're leaving town.

641
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,070
If so, I'll say my goodbyes now, then.

642
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,827
You a right bastard.

643
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,826
An accurate assessment, Mary.

644
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,033
- How could you do that?
- Do what?

645
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,502
I ain't blind, dentist.

646
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,810
- I see what's happening between y'all.
- And?

647
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,444
Don't you care nothing about that girl?

648
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,128
- More than I realized.
- Then why ain't you helping her, man?

649
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,560
I am.

650
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,698
If I join her, she'll stay and fight.

651
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,898
If she fights, she may die.

652
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,930
I would like for Hannah to live.

653
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,016
Miss Beaumont, sir.

654
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,747
- Miss Beaumont.
- Mr. Lockwood.

655
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,257
Won't you join me for breakfast?

656
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,420
No?

657
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:16,897
Would you care for some whiskey?

658
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:23,339
I don't mean to insult you. l just never met
a female bounty hunter before.

659
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,476
What is it that you want?

660
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,673
Well, we never met.

661
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,713
I don't buy cattle,
or use the services of your prostitutes,

662
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,415
or your gambling parlor.
'When would we have met?

663
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:40,852
Your mouth runs faster
than that gun comes off your hip.

664
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:41,952
Now, come here a minute.

665
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:44,225
I try not to waste ammunition or words.

666
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,130
As I said coming in,
what is the purpose of this meeting?

667
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:49,102
Just come on down here for a second,
take a look out here with me.

668
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,965
Come on, don't be afraid of falling.

669
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,307
I'm not afraid of falling, I'm afraid of landing.

670
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,539
That's very good.

671
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:04,049
Now, what do you see?

672
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:10,818
Dodge.

673
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:15,021
All right, but me I see a city.

674
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:21,033
A city that the wags out east
call the wickedest city in all America,

675
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,628
and they are not far from wrong.

676
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,637
Every manner of vice known to man

677
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:30,769
can be perpetrated
on the other side of the tracks,

678
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,781
and every rustler and buffalo hunter,

679
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:40,550
gambler, cowboy, renegade, Indian,
lawman and bad man,

680
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,955
they all pass through here,
and some of them stay.

681
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:47,624
Some stay forever, right up there,

682
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,056
right on Boot Hill.

683
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,600
Okay now, you hear that? Listen.

684
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,968
Now that ain't the sound of thunder,
you know what that is,

685
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,098
right there, that's power.

686
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,438
Right there is my power.

687
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,837
Beef on hoof.

688
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,380
Driven all the way up
from the Chisholm Trail, get on!

689
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:15,121
That is why I sit up here
and I have my breakfast,

690
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,622
watch the herd come in.

691
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,320
There's nothing quite like it.

692
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,728
What were we talking about again?

693
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:31,137
Okay, Dodge City sits at the cross roads
between east and west.

694
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,232
It is the portal through which all commerce,

695
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,540
both legal and illicit, passes through,

696
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,106
and the man who controls that gateway,
well he controls all that passes through it.

697
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,776
You follow me?

698
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,412
Well, from what I can see,

699
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,718
you're just about the most powerful man
within 1,000 miles of here.

700
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,826
- Yeah, just about.
- So what is it you want with me?

701
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,455
I'm aware of your upcoming conflict
with Frank McMurphy.

702
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,658
Who isn't?

703
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,399
Well the difference is,
I would like to see no such conflict

704
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,532
transpire in Dodge City.

705
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,041
I'm touched.

706
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,601
Well you need not be,

707
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,409
my concern is not for you, it is for the town.

708
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:17,378
I don't want to see Frank McMurphy
and his men reduce it to rubble.

709
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,915
Well that's clear enough,
and for you, rarely honest.

710
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:28,819
I have devised a mutually beneficial solution
for both of us.

711
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,991
One that is financially beneficial.

712
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,365
You're offering me money to leave town.

713
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,842
I feel like one of your women.

714
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,676
But you are...

715
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,773
I don't think so.

716
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,682
Well you haven't heard how much yet.

717
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,508
And you think that would matter to me?

718
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,916
Well, I don't know.

719
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,723
Now we've met at least.

720
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,290
Miss Beaumont.

721
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,763
No one will help you.

722
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,194
You know?

723
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,092
What makes you so sure?

724
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,967
This is my town.

725
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,413
"What makes you so sure?"

726
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,164
I thought you were long gone.

727
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,307
If you were smart, you'd run away.

728
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:56,948
Of course, if you were smart,
you wouldn't have let me go.

729
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,784
So take one piece of advice from me.

730
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,215
What?

731
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,956
Ride out of here.

732
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,259
And go where?

733
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:08,621
Alaska.

734
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,230
No, seriously, come with me.

735
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,132
Yukon territory is beautiful.

736
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,070
And freeze my ass off?

737
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:20,702
Let's start a new life.

738
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:26,909
Hey, they got bad guys
up in Alaska too, you know.

739
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:30,679
Not the ones I'm looking for.

740
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,718
'Well, I tried.

741
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,585
One last lesson.

742
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,724
Remember when I said there'd be a time
when the fight wouldn't be fair?

743
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:45,923
Yeah.

744
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,468
This is it.

745
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,561
You're not gonna take this bunch in alive.

746
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:53,901
Prepare for that.

747
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,205
Okay.

748
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,914
There's only one way
you're gonna live through this day.

749
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,691
I'm all ears.

750
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,383
You gotta control the fight, girl.

751
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,926
Stay on your feet, you move better.

752
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,460
You start with your rifle
when they're at a distance.

753
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:24,596
And when they get closer,
time for the shotgun.

754
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,342
And when it gets all close and dirty,

755
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,006
then you go to your hog leg.

756
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,678
You're not gonna be around?

757
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,485
I came here to take you away.

758
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,123
I'm too old to fight.

759
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,755
I don't fancy dying in Kansas.

760
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,036
You're on your own now, girl.

761
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,148
Doesn't the stable have someone
who does that?

762
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,783
Yup, me.

763
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:22,920
Yeah, they're like my children.

764
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,019
I take care of them,

765
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,357
and they take care of me.

766
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,462
Beautiful.

767
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,930
Well, help then.

768
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,904
Been trying to stir up men to help, Hannah,

769
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:48,606
but I'm afraid this town
is populated with nothing but geldings.

770
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:56,123
You know I wanna be
right beside you, Hannah.

771
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,084
I know.

772
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,786
Bastard Lockwood.

773
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:05,060
He's sending me out on a stage run,
right after sunrise.

774
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:08,402
I'm gonna be 10 miles outside of Dodge

775
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,199
long before the McMurphy gang
even get here.

776
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,934
Well, it's official then,

777
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,369
I'm alone.

778
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,146
Well, you can always run.

779
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:31,186
Okay. Why not?

780
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,388
Can you at least tell me that?

781
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:47,970
They killed my family.

782
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:54,775
<i>McMurphy'-5' gang</i>

783
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:57,215
I was just a kid.

784
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,084
Sweet Jesus.

785
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:01,554
The only reason they didn't get me
is because I was hid in a barn.

786
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,152
Maybe I was meant to die that day.

787
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:08,818
I laid in that barn and I prayed.

788
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,559
I prayed that someone would come
and stop them.

789
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,694
No one came.

790
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,862
So I became that person.

791
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:23,167
That person who would be there
when others needed help.

792
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,769
And I would track down those men.

793
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:28,679
That's why I picked Dodge,
because I knew that eventually

794
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,550
every outlaw would walk through the doors
of The Long Branch,

795
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:33,951
and with every man, I wondered,

796
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,253
would I ever get to McMurphy himself,
and now he's coming.

797
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,987
Yeah, but tomorrow he ain't coming alone.

798
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,829
I ain't afraid to die.

799
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,567
What are you afraid of?

800
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,734
What will happen if I win?

801
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,713
I've chased these men
through my nightmares for 12 years.

802
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:03,873
Twelve years.

803
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,084
When this is over, who will I be?

804
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:38,515
It's a fine day for it.

805
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,983
I would say so, sir.

806
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,429
I ain't going!

807
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:02,275
You have your orders.
Those settlers have asked for our help.

808
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,242
I can't leave town now!

809
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,281
Yeah, you can't leave town now, Wyatt,
you're gonna miss all the fun.

810
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,145
Hold your tongue!

811
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:14,247
Wyatt, we don't get to enforce the laws
we want, when we want to.

812
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:19,492
So if you have a problem with that,
you take that badge off right now.

813
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:27,595
No, sir.

814
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,043
Hey, Wyatt.

815
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:45,744
- Morning, Hannah.
- Morning. Going for a ride?

816
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,420
Deger's ordering me out of town.

817
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,483
Lockwood's doing.

818
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,124
They're stacking the deck against you.

819
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:58,694
Hannah, you gotta know, being a lawman
is the only thing I ever been good at,

820
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,028
but if you want me to stay here with you...

821
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,625
You have to do what they tell you.

822
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,934
But you don't have to do this.
Ride out with me.

823
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,398
It's too late for that.

824
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,414
All right, gentlemen.

825
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,694
Well, gentlemen, as expected,

826
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,763
our lady bounty hunter
has made herself scarce.

827
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,436
Hack, you get Turk and Stitch
out of the hoosegow,

828
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:19,241
and Redwing, you check out
the boarding house.

829
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:22,839
It's not like the little trollop's
gonna step out onto the street

830
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:25,385
and let us shoot her full of lead.

831
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,373
Well, I'll be.

832
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,338
You are the lady bounty hunter, I surmise.

833
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,348
I hear you got a bee in your bonnet for us all.

834
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:01,010
Not all of ya.

835
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,421
You there. You men who are new.

836
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:10,222
I have no quarrel with you,
you can ride on outta here.

837
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:16,158
My men ride where I ride.

838
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,566
I had to give them a chance.

839
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,605
Now what?

840
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,203
Are you gonna kill us all?

841
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,839
Those of you who don't come in
to face the law, yeah.

842
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,886
Anyone who wants to live,
throw down your guns.

843
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:43,095
What is she thinking? She's all alone.

844
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,058
Maybe she ain't alone.
Maybe she got other guns on us right now.

845
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,530
I say she's bluffing.

846
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,536
Lockwood said she's alone, she's alone.

847
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:59,369
Ain't nobody in this town
gonna stick their neck out for her.

848
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,419
She ain't more...

849
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,992
She's just barely a woman.

850
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,130
All right gentlemen,

851
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,560
take her.

852
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,798
Let's do it! Let's go!

853
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:32,402
Move in you fools, you're too far away!

854
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,771
<i>You gotta control the fight, girl.</i>

855
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:41,218
<i>You start with your rifle,
when you're at a distance.</i>

856
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,722
Get in there!

857
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,783
- Get her!
- Too far away. Move in on her.

858
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,420
Nobody kills her, bring her to me!

859
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:51,864
I want her now!

860
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,172
Boss, you all right?

861
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:05,674
Don't just stand around here.
Find her, kill her.

862
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,574
<i>And when they get closer,
time for the shotgun.</i>

863
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,297
Move your ass, girl!

864
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,269
Unless you want it shot off.

865
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,343
Come on! Come on!

866
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:51,619
Come on, tumbleweed!

867
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,728
Nice shooting, Mary.

868
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,359
Come on!

869
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,247
Come on! Come on!

870
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,821
You said it would be a cakewalk!

871
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,948
Find her! Kill her!

872
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,216
Lauren.

873
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,187
Sir?

874
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,031
- Get my rifle.
- Yes, sir.

875
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,502
It's a damn slaughter out there.

876
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,975
- What the hell are you doing here?
- My job.

877
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,674
You let them out?

878
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,042
Get out of here this minute
or you will not have a job.

879
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,342
I'm only gonna say this once!

880
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:52,050
Get to fighting, or get to running.

881
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,085
Behind you, Mare!

882
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,550
Come out, boy!

883
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,218
Wyatt!

884
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,996
Keep your ass down.

885
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:14,325
Hey!

886
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:44,487
I got you now.

887
01:13:56,265 --> 01:14:00,111
The animal is always the most dangerous
when it's cornered.

888
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,708
You greenhorn.

889
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:24,029
I'm gonna skin your butt.
And nail your hide to my barn wall.

890
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:27,736
I don't think so.

891
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,783
I told you,

892
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:51,696
your need for revenge
is what would get me killed one day.

893
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,434
You were finally right about something.

894
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,971
Had to be, eventually.

895
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,775
Why the hell did you come back?

896
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,278
Had to help my...

897
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,315
Little girl.

898
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,296
Hannah? Hannah?

899
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:34,197
Hannah.

900
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,199
We got the others,
but McMurphy's holed up in the church.

901
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,904
Hannah! He has the kids.

902
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,617
Hannah!

903
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,730
- Wyatt! Help Mattie!
- Hannah!

904
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:58,924
Come on, let's go.

905
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,297
Come on, get 'em outta here,
get 'em outta here.

906
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,159
Everyone okay?

907
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:09,040
<i>And when it gets close and dirty,</i>

908
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:10,508
<i>you go to your hog leg.</i>

909
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:25,519
Let the girl go.

910
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,686
'Well I don't think that would be wise.

911
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:32,294
I suspect this pretty little thing here

912
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:37,766
is the only thing keeping you
from putting a 45 caliber hole in my hide.

913
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:45,478
Another 45 caliber hole.

914
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:54,552
Now, you lay your gun down,
and you clear a path to that door.

915
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,278
No.

916
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,888
Back away, or I'll cut you down.

917
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,986
Like you killed my family?

918
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,155
I killed your...

919
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:09,501
Abilene, 12 years ago,
you killed them for our horses.

920
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,396
That's what this is about.

921
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,074
I remember now.

922
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,405
I don't remember seeing you, though.

923
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,874
I saw you.

924
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:25,707
All of you.

925
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,083
Find Mattie.

926
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,926
Nice shot, that old black outlaw,
he taught you well.

927
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,333
He just taught me to shoot.

928
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:42,092
You taught me to hate.

929
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:48,802
And you kept all that hate
simmering inside you all these years?

930
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,900
It's kind of impressive.

931
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:53,774
Well...

932
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,841
...better finish it.

933
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:00,442
It is finished.

934
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,547
It's not over till one of us is dead.

935
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,019
No, I'm giving you to the law.

936
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:08,260
My only regret
is that I can't see you hung separately

937
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,819
for each innocent life you took.

938
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,056
My father.

939
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,936
My mother. My brother.

940
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,361
Brother?

941
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:21,968
Caleb.

942
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:25,868
Hell, I didn't kill your brother.

943
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:28,776
What are you talking about?

944
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:37,052
Well, I killed your parents,
yeah, that's for sure,

945
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:41,791
but the blonde haired honker,
well, we didn't kill him.

946
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:44,790
We took him.

947
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,255
You're lying.

948
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,999
You know I'm not. He's alive.

949
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:53,039
Well at least he was, last time I saw him.

950
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,399
Where is he?

951
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,570
We took him,
and we raised him up real good,

952
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,784
to be a real good outlaw like me.

953
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:07,476
Where?

954
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:17,026
Let that hammer fall,

955
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,794
and then you'll never know.

956
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,229
Let them hang me, and you never know.

957
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:33,139
Who thought it would end like this?

958
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,219
No.

959
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,357
Where is my brother?

960
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:48,688
Where?

961
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:54,525
Wouldn't you like to know.

962
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,872
Hannah, I had to.

963
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:11,650
He was gonna shoot you.

964
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,231
Hey.

965
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:10,866
Hannah.

966
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:12,642
Should have taken the money.

967
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:37,962
Hannah.

968
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,768
Well, yes, of course, darling, you're welcome.

969
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:48,242
Mary.

970
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,512
Thought you weren't coming to this dance?

971
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,622
Yes, well, I liked the odds.

972
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,432
I may have been wrong.

973
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:53,404
Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp,
the grateful people of Dodge City

974
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:57,583
promote you from Assistant Marshal
to City Marshal.

975
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:02,287
Berry? What kind of a name is that?

976
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:03,445
Hush.

977
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,286
Hannah darling, he's a huckleberry.

978
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:10,129
Deger, get out of Dodge.

979
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:30,275
You going?

980
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:34,547
- Should I stay?
- Your call.

981
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:42,124
Dodge City is a bit too tame for me, I think.

982
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:46,565
I hear they've discovered silver in Arizona.

983
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,258
A town called Tombstone.

984
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,965
Wide open boom town.

985
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,006
Sounds more like your style.

986
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,432
Yeah.

987
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:59,042
Perhaps I'll make my way there.

988
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,938
Doc?

989
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,944
Yes, my scarlet queen.

990
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:09,948
Thanks.

991
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,469
Well, Hanny...

992
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,644
You figure out who you are?

993
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:48,924
Well, you can always buy yourself a dress,
some books,

994
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:52,759
make yourself the town schoolmarm.

995
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:55,095
I don't think so.

996
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,530
I'm not done yet.

997
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,134
I thought you found them all.

998
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,169
There's one more man left to find.

999
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:06,976
And kill?

1000
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:12,851
Not this one.
