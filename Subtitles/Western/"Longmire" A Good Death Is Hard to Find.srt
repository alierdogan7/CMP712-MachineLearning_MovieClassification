Says who?

887
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,483
Achilles.

888
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:14,019
About 3,000 years ago.

889
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,022
Read "The Iliad"?

890
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm familiar with the classics.

891
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:24,096
But have you <i>read</i> it, Ed?

892
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,667
Interpretations vary.

893
00:41:28,768 --> 00:41:33,438
I think it's a poem
about a man's destructive rage.

894
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,842
Achilles was a warrior.

895
00:41:36,943 --> 00:41:40,479
He had a partner,
a fellow warrior.

896
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,580
A friend.

897
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:44,416
There's no greater enemy

898
00:41:44,484 --> 00:41:47,119
than the mortal enemy
of a friend.

899
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,555
I would not disagree with that.

900
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:52,457
So Achilles confronted
his friend's great enemy.

901
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,828
Achilles gave the man
one warning...

902
00:41:55,929 --> 00:41:58,730
There is no weapon...

903
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:01,600
No army that could protect
this enemy

904
00:42:01,668 --> 00:42:05,671
from the sheer hell
that is Achilles' rage.

905
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:11,710
And what happened
to this enemy?

906
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:14,780
Achilles ran his sword
through the man's guts

907
00:42:14,848 --> 00:42:17,749
and dragged his dead body
around the town.

908
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:20,419
So...

909
00:42:20,486 --> 00:42:25,457
could this enemy have done
anything otherwise?

910
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:37,669
He could have got out of town

911
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:40,639
while he still had the chance.

912
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:56,066
