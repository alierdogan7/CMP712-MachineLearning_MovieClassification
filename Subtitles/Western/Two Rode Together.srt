1
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:19,219
Thank you, Jesu.

2
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:35,109
Señor, the widow Gomez
has delivered a son this morning.

3
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,111
A boy.

4
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:39,572
Bully for the widow Gomez.

5
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:43,034
But, señor, it has been
more than a year ago...

6
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:46,955
...since Señor Antonio Gomez
has been buried in the church house.

7
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:51,084
Well, there are some men you just can't
trust to stay where you put them.

8
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:56,756
You gamblers?

9
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,093
Just get off the stage?

10
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,220
You got eyes in your head, ain't you?

11
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:05,306
It's what I'm paid for.

12
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:08,226
Oh, the marshal, huh?

13
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:10,311
All right, now.

14
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,481
The stage is leaving
in about 15 minutes.

15
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:17,610
You fellas want a drink, there's
a cantina down the street a piece.

16
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,154
They're not too particular
about their customers.

17
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:24,409
- Look here, whatever your name is...
- The name's McCabe.

18
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:25,869
Guthrie McCabe.

19
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:31,624
We was just passing through.
Nice little town you have here.

20
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,710
Did you say they serve
good whiskey?

21
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:35,169
No.

22
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,316
Detail, ho!

23
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,323
- Hi, Jim.
- Hiya.

24
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,243
- How are things out at Fort Grant?
- Same as usual.

25
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:11,581
Who is it? Is that Sergeant Posey?
Sergeant Posey?

26
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,210
I hardly recognised you.

27
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,463
Haven't you put on some weight?

28
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,636
Well, that's a nice...

29
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:27,305
...dirty, thirsty-looking outfit
you got there, Jim.

30
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:30,767
- Forty miles.
- Forty miles, huh?

31
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:33,895
Hey, you men!
How about a nice cold beer?

32
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:36,689
As you were.

33
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:39,776
I haven't dismissed
the detail, sergeant.

34
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:40,985
No, sir.

35
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:45,823
And before I do, I want one thing
clearly understood.

36
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,077
We're riding out of here
in a couple of hours.

37
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:51,538
And I mean riding, not floating.

38
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:55,291
"Riding not floating," that's good.
I'm gonna use that.

39
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,503
And just because Marshal McCabe here
has been generous enough...

40
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,923
...to set us up to five or six beers...
- I didn't say five or...

41
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,759
...that's no reason to abuse
his hospitality.

42
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:07,720
- Hey, just one beer.
- I count on your discretion, sergeant.

43
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:11,224
That's all. Detail dismissed!

44
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,227
- Hiya, Guthrie.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

45
00:05:14,394 --> 00:05:15,687
What?

46
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:20,066
- Jim, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

47
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,944
- You know, I... No, wait a minute.
- What?

48
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,613
Jesu, fetch a ladder...

49
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,492
...so that Sergeant Posey can get up
on that poor, unfortunate animal.

50
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,378
By George, he made it.

51
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:41,963
Thank you, marshal.

52
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,466
It'll be a pleasure
drinking to your health.

53
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,052
Follow me!

54
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:51,306
Well, that was pretty funny, Jim.

55
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:54,017
But if you think I'm gonna ante up
for all the beer...

56
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:56,352
...that hippopotamus
of a sergeant can drink...

57
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,856
...between now and the time you leave,
you got two more things coming.

58
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:03,276
- You're up for re-election, aren't you?
- Sergeant Posey can't vote.

59
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:05,695
I bet he can't even make
his mark on the ballot.

60
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:08,573
- What about yourself? Want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

61
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,826
I'll take this one. Cheers.

62
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,123
Now, Ward.

63
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,500
Ward, come here.

64
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,794
Oh, it's you, Mr. McCabe.

65
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,546
Was you calling my name?

66
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:25,173
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:28,676
I told you to take those drunks
over to the courthouse.

68
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:31,429
Yes, sir, Mr. McCabe,
that's what you told me...

69
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,974
...and that's what I done,
didn't I, fellers?

70
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,770
But it wasn't no use. No use at all.

71
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,897
Was it, fellers?

72
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:47,529
Well, now, Ward,
why wasn't it any use?

73
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:50,949
- Or am I supposed to guess?
- No, sir, Mr. McCabe.

74
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:55,078
Not that it calls for much guessing,
and that's a true fact.

75
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,955
Well, what it comes down to...

76
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:59,707
...is that the judge hisself
was drunk last night...

77
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,293
...and never even showed up
in court today.

78
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:05,338
And so as I see it,
they ain't but one thing to do...

79
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,258
...and that's just march
these fellers back to the jail...

80
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:12,887
...until the judge sobers up enough
to fine them legal and proper.

81
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,098
Now, come on, you fellers. Hurry up.

82
00:07:15,306 --> 00:07:17,517
- One, two...
- Ward.

83
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,812
Turn them loose.

84
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:24,357
Now, you fellers listen to me.

85
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:29,320
By orders of Marshal McCabe,
I'm a-turning you loose.

86
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,614
Go on, you're loose!

87
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:35,785
You ain't turning us loose without
buying us a beer, are you, marshal?

88
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:41,541
You fellas don't mind drinking with
gamblers and fort soldiers, do you?

89
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:46,671
All right, Ward, buy them a beer
and point them toward home.

90
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:50,049
Let's go, boys.

91
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,890
Belle?

92
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,018
- Look who's here.
- Hello.

93
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:04,105
Guth, how many times
have I told you...

94
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:07,317
...I don't even wanna look
at a man before 5:00.

95
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,527
Out! Outside, both of you.

96
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:13,281
Oh, now, Belle, honey, all we want
is just a... All we want is...

97
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:16,701
You can have anything you want
out on the veranda.

98
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:20,788
Well, that's a pretty broad statement.
That takes in a lot of territory, Belle.

99
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,791
Lieutenant Gary, I have nothing
against you or the Army.

100
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,835
Well, I sincerely hope not, ma'am.

101
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,754
Ma'am?!

102
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,839
- What am I, your maiden aunt?
- No, ma'am.

103
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,799
- Call me Mrs. Aragon.
- Mrs. Aragon.

104
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,176
- Call me Belle.
- Belle.

105
00:08:33,343 --> 00:08:35,345
Call me madam
if you're tired of living...

106
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,598
...but don't call me ma'am.
- No, ma'am.

107
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,728
And don't brush
that dust off in here.

108
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,355
Excuse me. I'm sorry, ma'am.

109
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:47,690
If you give me a broom,
I could sweep it up.

110
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:51,319
- Never mind. Never mind.
- It'd just take a second.

111
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,822
Well, what will you have?

112
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:57,116
What he could use most is a bath.

113
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,786
Now, don't keep saying
things like that to me.

114
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:03,665
I'm sorry, that's one service
we don't provide.

115
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,042
Not that it doesn't
have its possibilities.

116
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,797
- Beer suit you?
- You read my mind.

117
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:15,843
With most men
that's not too difficult.

118
00:09:16,219 --> 00:09:18,721
And not too interesting either.

119
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,599
I can tell when a man
walks through that door...

120
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:24,310
...whether he prefers
blonds or brunettes...

121
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,563
...drinks whiskey or beer...

122
00:09:26,771 --> 00:09:29,274
...plays blackjack or poker...

123
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,945
...is a cheapskate or a high roller.
- Is that a fact?

124
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,074
Well, how do you peg old Jim here?
Oh, excuse me.

125
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,412
- Beer, blonds and solitaire.
- Solitaire, that's me.

126
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,081
And that'll be four bits, Guth.
He hasn't got a dime.

127
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:47,792
You called it. I haven't got a dime.

128
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,211
Except I'm not so sure
about blonds.

129
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:52,630
No man ever is.

130
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,300
- That's true.
- Well, Jim...

131
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,677
...what brings you to town?

132
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:01,306
Orders.

133
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:07,562
Well, sure. I didn't think you'd ridden
40 miles for fresh air and sunshine.

134
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:11,858
My orders are
to accompany you to Fort Grant.

135
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,068
- Accompany me?
- That's right.

136
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:17,822
And I'm to use any means
short of handcu...

137
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,825
Any means short of handcuffing you
to persuade you...

138
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:22,911
...to accept the major's invitation.

139
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:25,371
And if you don't accept,
I will handcuff you.

140
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:28,625
Sit down, Belle, join us.

141
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,256
What, has there been
a murder out at the fort or...?

142
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:39,302
Somebody run off
with the sutler's wife?

143
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,471
- Nope.
- Why not?

144
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:44,057
- It wouldn't be a case of stealing?
- No.

145
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:46,309
What soldier's got anything
worth stealing?

146
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:49,562
- That's very true.
- No. I can't agree with that at all.

147
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,899
- You're... You're not gonna tell me?
- No, I'm not gonna tell you.

148
00:10:54,526 --> 00:10:56,986
Well, I don't know, Jim.
That's an awful long ride.

149
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:58,863
<i>Forty miles. You know, that's...</i>

150
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,115
No, no, that's not so far.

151
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:05,703
And I have my duties here
to think of.

152
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:10,083
McCabe, I don't put
my foot down often.

153
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,877
And that's one of the things
I like about you, Belle.

154
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:14,170
Just one of the things.

155
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:17,465
But it's a very rare quality in a woman,
and I admire you for it.

156
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:19,717
What time did you say
we were gonna leave?

157
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,803
- Three o'clock.
- Three o'clock. Fine.

158
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:25,223
Oh, Belle, get the cook
to build me a steak, will you?

159
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,226
And well-done this time.
Not raw like it was last night.

160
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:30,395
You didn't eat here last night.

161
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:33,064
Or the night before.

162
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:35,775
Well, come to think of it,
I didn't, did I?

163
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:39,737
No. No, that's right,
I guess I didn't.

164
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:46,035
Detail, ho!

165
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,293
Fall out for water.

166
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,880
- Fifteen minutes.
- Fifteen minutes!

167
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,563
It's harder than my saddle.

168
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,941
You're in great shape,
sitting on that porch.

169
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:25,033
You know, I still can't figure it out.

170
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:31,372
I can't figure it out. No fuss.

171
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,958
No argument.

172
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,212
What made you decide
to come along?

173
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,839
Ride all night
on some wild goose chase.

174
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,675
I'll tell you this, you didn't
decide me to come along.

175
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,386
- I'll tell you that.
- I didn't figure I did.

176
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:50,433
Those things come one in a box?

177
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,020
- Don't you ever buy your own cigars?
- Sure. I bought two last payday.

178
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,564
- That was three months ago.
- Here.

179
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,566
Thanks a lot.

180
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,447
Hey, I got a match.

181
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:07,867
Gee, I'm surprised
you can afford matches.

182
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:10,662
I can handle that, all right.

183
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,001
Why did you come?

184
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:19,587
<i>Well...</i>

185
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:25,176
If you must know, it was mostly
to get away from Belle.

186
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,345
Belle? Why?

187
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:31,224
- I thought you two were kind of:
- I know, I know, I know.

188
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:37,981
Well, to be completely
ungentlemanly about it...

189
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:40,942
I... Not that I ever pretended
to be otherwise.

190
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:42,902
We were, we were.

191
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,737
That's what I heard.

192
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:46,614
And...

193
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:51,870
...just lately she started
calling me "Guth."

194
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:53,997
I noticed that.

195
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:58,042
Guth. The first time I heard it I thought
she'd got something stuck in her teeth.

196
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:02,213
Guth, Guth, Guth. But she didn't
have anything stuck in her teeth.

197
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:05,758
It was in her craw...

198
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,220
...and a few nights ago she got it out.

199
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:12,390
Yeah, go ahead. What happened?

200
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:15,560
Well, that's not a subject you can
discuss in mixed company...

201
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:19,439
...especially when
one of the parties is...

202
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,649
Matrimony.

203
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,736
- No.
- Matrimony.

204
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:27,322
Holy smoke. Matrimony.

205
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:33,077
And, of course, in this case,
when one of the parties is sort of...

206
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:38,499
You know, she carries a stiletto
right there in her garter.

207
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,751
I know.

208
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:43,504
And we were sitting
around the place talking...

209
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:46,174
How do you know?

210
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,676
Well, you just told me.

211
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:53,973
Say, she actually proposed, huh?

212
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,476
- You didn't know about that before?
- About what?

213
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:58,520
About the stiletto?

214
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:02,273
How would I know
about that before? Come on.

215
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,318
What do you mean?
Did she propose? No.

216
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:08,196
She didn't, if you mean
getting down on one knee.

217
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:10,657
She didn't do that.

218
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:13,910
You have to give her credit
for more animal cunning than that.

219
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,329
<i>No, no. As I...</i>

220
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:20,458
As I remember the approach...

221
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,169
...it was that she didn't see
why I was satisfied...

222
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,213
...with just 10 percent of her take...

223
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,300
...when she was willing
to go for fifty-fifty.

224
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:34,597
You mean to tell me you're getting
10 percent of Madam Aragon's place?

225
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:37,767
- Don't tell me you didn't know that.
- I didn't know about that.

226
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:39,978
I get 10 percent of everything
in Tascosa.

227
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,729
Holy crimanetta.

228
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:44,232
What? This goes along
with the job of marshal.

229
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,609
- You're a dirt...
- It's no secret about it.

230
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:49,195
- You're a dirty thief, McCabe.
- Everybody knows it.

231
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:50,905
Wait a minute.

232
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:55,243
You don't think I could live
on the marshal's salary, do you?

233
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,997
- A measly $100 a month, Jim?
- Well, that's 20 more than I get.

234
00:15:59,163 --> 00:16:03,084
I know, but look...
Look at you.

235
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:06,421
Look at you. Jim, Jim.

236
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,050
You're a man of simple wants.

237
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,344
I just require a little more, that's all.

238
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:17,140
- Oh, come on, that's a lot of hogwash.
- Horses are watered, sir!

239
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:20,310
All right, Posey.
The men refill their canteens?

240
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:23,813
Well, the men did,
but I didn't notice you refilling yours.

241
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,815
That's right. I'm afraid I haven't.

242
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:27,275
There you go again.

243
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:30,028
Just when I think I got you
trained real good...

244
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:32,488
...you go forgetting things like now.

245
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:35,241
It's just downright
discouraging, lieutenant.

246
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,870
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sergeant.
It won't happen again.

247
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,831
Hey, Slim! Fill mine up
while you're at it, will you?

248
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:45,001
- Now, see here, civilian...
- Posey. Posey.

249
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,629
Marshal McCabe's our guest.

250
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:50,256
He's afraid of getting
his fancy boots wet.

251
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,508
<i>And me with my feet killing...</i>

252
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:55,303
Well, there goes another man
with simple wants.

253
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,971
Eight beers.

254
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:37,929
There he is,
the blessing of the Lord.

255
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,182
Clay, Pete, come here.

256
00:17:56,573 --> 00:17:57,907
<i>William.</i>

257
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,909
William!

258
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:01,953
- William!
- Anna!

259
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,706
Anna!

260
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,428
You sure seem to be popular
around here.

261
00:18:18,553 --> 00:18:21,890
The least you could do is tip your hat
or take a bow, make a speech.

262
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,474
Yeah, I might.

263
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:26,519
Except it's you they're cheering.

264
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:29,564
- Me?
- Yep.

265
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:37,280
You'll find him.

266
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:41,409
- You'll find my Toby!
- Here now, Mary. Now, Mary.

267
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:08,394
Well, he's here.

268
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:11,314
Does he know what he's here for?

269
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,108
That's not my department, sir.

270
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,947
Well, maybe we can
make it your department.

271
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:22,784
Yes, sir.

272
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,206
- Mrs. Frazer.
- Welcome back, Jim.

273
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:29,791
Thank you.

274
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,293
He'll find our son.

275
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,754
I know he will.

276
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,840
I could see a light...

277
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:41,177
...shining around his head.

278
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:43,846
Just like a halo.

279
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,559
You mean to tell me
you dragged me 40 miles...

280
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:49,477
...all the way out here, for that?

281
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,604
I did not drag you, Marshal McCabe.

282
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:54,190
You had reasons of your own
for coming, remember?

283
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:55,859
All right, Jim. All right.

284
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:59,320
Let's just say that I got my own
good reasons for going back.

285
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:02,198
- Lf I could catch a few hours sleep...
- Sleep?

286
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,659
Could you sleep knowing
what a disappointment...

287
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,661
...this is going to be
to those people?

288
00:20:06,828 --> 00:20:08,538
I'll sleep like a baby.

289
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:11,165
- I'll be happy to prove it.
- Now, wait. Take it easy.

290
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:14,002
You saw how those people looked
at you when we rode in.

291
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:15,587
I sure did. I sure did.

292
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:18,673
Now that you explained to me
why they looked at me like that...

293
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,550
...I can't say I'm too impressed.

294
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:23,887
That was the same kind of a look
the Romans gave the Christians...

295
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,306
...just before they turned
the lions loose.

296
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:29,434
All right. But you've had dealings
with Quanah Parker before.

297
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:32,604
He knows you. He trusts you.

298
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:36,524
Quanah Parker
wouldn't trust his mother.

299
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:40,153
Of course I've had dealings with him
with horses and hides.

300
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,529
A little gold one time.

301
00:20:41,696 --> 00:20:44,699
- Weapons?
- Yeah, yeah, a few weapons.

302
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:48,203
But I'll tell you this, I never once
rode out of that camp of his...

303
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:52,498
...without having the feeling that I'd
left something important behind me.

304
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,459
Like my scalp, for instance.

305
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:57,629
Would money influence your decision?

306
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:02,550
Yeah. Yeah, might.

307
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:05,386
I'd be exceeding my authority...

308
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:08,806
...but I'm prepared
to enrol you as a chief scout.

309
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:11,809
The pay is that of a first lieutenant.

310
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:16,314
- Eighty dollars a month?
- And found.

311
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:21,986
<i>Well, now, major...</i>

312
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,155
Now, I'll tell you what I'll do...

313
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,908
...just to show you
my heart's in the right place.

314
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:30,828
Now, there's 100,
2, 3... There's $400.

315
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:34,791
Good Yankee currency. That'll buy you
five chief scouts for a month.

316
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,794
Now, you tell them just exactly
what you told me:

317
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,422
That all they have to do is to ride
into Quanah Parker's camp...

318
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:44,133
...and tell him they want all
the white prisoners...

319
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,095
...his Comanches have captured
in the last 15, 20 years.

320
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:50,348
You get any takers, you can pay it
out of that 400.

321
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,016
No, go on, take it.

322
00:21:52,183 --> 00:21:55,353
I'll be riding out here in a month or so.
I'll pick up what's left.

323
00:21:56,855 --> 00:22:00,400
Mr. Gary, perhaps Marshal McCabe
can share your quarters...

324
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:05,029
...until he's rested sufficiently to return
to his more lucrative duties in Tascosa.

325
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:07,115
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:10,368
I know Madam Aragon
will be glad to see him back.

327
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:12,787
- Won't she, Guth?
- Hell, now, Jim...

328
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:16,916
- Just what is your price, McCabe?
- Lf you'd call him Guth, he'll shave...

329
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:21,045
I don't know what this private joke's
about, but it's gone far enough.

330
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:26,885
Just how much do you think
human lives are worth, McCabe?

331
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:29,804
Whatever the market will bear.
No more, no less.

332
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:32,515
I've told you what I could pay.
That's all I can do.

333
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:35,435
Well, I believe you, major.

334
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:37,478
I believe you.

335
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:40,315
- So I'll take it.
- Sit down.

336
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,567
- Well, I'd prefer, sir...
- Sit down!

337
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,320
You understand,
this is just a matter of principal.

338
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:49,073
I'll make up the balance
from that bunch of sooners out there.

339
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,367
What balance?

340
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:55,872
- I figure it's worth about $500.
- What?

341
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,792
Five hundred dollars a head
for each captive I bring in.

342
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,378
If this is another joke,
I want to tell you...

343
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:04,881
...I regard it in extremely bad taste.

344
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:07,175
And you can consider that
my lowest offer.

345
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:10,929
- And you, sir, can go to the devil.
- All right.

346
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:12,722
Suit yourself.

347
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:15,975
Suit yourself, but just remember this:

348
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:19,145
Now, you can't send a troop
into Comanche territory...

349
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:21,272
...without breaking the peace treaty.

350
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:24,359
One false move, and you have
another Indian war on your hand.

351
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:27,529
- Wouldn't look good on your record.
- Never mind my record.

352
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:31,074
They'd bust you, major.
They'd bust you, and you know it.

353
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:34,327
In the meantime, you got congressmen
breathing down your neck...

354
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:36,829
...to do something about
those constituents there.

355
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:41,292
Now, what you need is a civilian to pull
the Army's chestnuts out of the fire...

356
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:44,420
...and you want me to work
for Army pay. Oh, no.

357
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:47,340
Those sodbusters out there
haven't $500 between them.

358
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:51,386
They've begged, borrowed, and
sold everything to get this far.

359
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:54,556
That's my problem,
that's not your problem. My problem.

360
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,559
Now, you just give me three hours
out there in that camp...

361
00:23:57,725 --> 00:24:00,436
...and if there's any hard cash...
- He'll smell it out.

362
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:01,980
That's correct.

363
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:04,482
That's... I'll smell it out.

364
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:07,694
Now, are you gonna make
the decision for them, major...

365
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:11,155
...or are you gonna let them make up
their own minds like they should?

366
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:14,409
I don't know how the word got out
that I'd sent for you...

367
00:24:14,576 --> 00:24:15,702
...but somehow it did.

368
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:17,704
And they've been
expecting a messiah...

369
00:24:17,871 --> 00:24:20,707
...a Moses come to deliver
their children from bondage.

370
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:22,959
And I've got to send them you.

371
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:24,752
Get him out of here.

372
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,589
And leave the door open
to let in a little fresh air.

373
00:24:27,755 --> 00:24:30,258
A pleasure to do business
with you, major.

374
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:32,093
Pleasure.

375
00:24:38,683 --> 00:24:41,144
They burned up the whole place.

376
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:44,272
The boy, they kill.
We find him the next day.

377
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:47,525
But the little girl, she was just gone.

378
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,944
- How old was she?
- Freda?

379
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:52,822
Freda was 9 year old.

380
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:55,450
- That would make her 16 now.
- Yeah.

381
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:59,996
Yeah. The fourth of August, 16.

382
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:01,915
Go home, Mr. Knudsen.

383
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:04,792
Go home.

384
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,546
Give it up.

385
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:11,799
Go on back to Minnesota,
forget you ever had a daughter.

386
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:13,509
Forget? Forget I...?

387
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,095
<i>The Comanche...</i>

388
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,140
The Comanches mate
their women early.

389
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:20,892
If your daughter's still alive...

390
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,561
...she's probably got a couple
half-breed kids by now.

391
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:27,190
Oh, come on, McCabe,
that's a hell of a thing to say.

392
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:30,360
That don't makes no matter to me.

393
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:31,819
No, by golly.

394
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:34,197
She's still my little girl Freda.

395
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:36,533
I don't go back without her.

396
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:39,786
Please, mister, listen to me.

397
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:42,372
For seven years we wait...

398
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,958
...Mama and me. Wait for the Army.

399
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:48,253
The Army to beat them,
them dirty devils.

400
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,256
So we can come back
here again for Freda.

401
00:25:51,464 --> 00:25:54,217
Seven long years we work and save.

402
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:59,556
I got $285, mister, for my Freda.

403
00:26:03,142 --> 00:26:06,354
All right,
take the description, Mr. Wringle.

404
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:08,147
All right, Ole.

405
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:10,441
What colour was Freda's eyes?

406
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:12,861
Eyes was blue.

407
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:15,697
Colour of her hair?

408
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:17,615
Hair was yellow.

409
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,243
Yellow like corn silk.

410
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:22,412
Yellow like gold, it was.

411
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah, just like gold, $285 worth.

412
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:29,669
You don't need me for this.

413
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:36,593
Form your square!

414
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,348
Ready your partner!

415
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:43,850
Now corners off.

416
00:26:50,231 --> 00:26:54,861
Of all the stupid...
Wait, you're breaking everything.

417
00:26:55,737 --> 00:26:58,448
I give up! I give up!

418
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,951
Well, now, that's more like it,
Miss Marty.

419
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:05,246
Back home, I usually come a-calling
for my gal at the front door.

420
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,540
May I have the honour
of the first dance?

421
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:10,501
I'm claiming the first dance, Ortho.

422
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:12,545
Now, fair play, Greely.

423
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,174
I get to get the first dance,
Miss Marty.

424
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:18,218
You do?

425
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:22,972
Come on, honey,
I'll help you down.

426
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:32,982
Good evening, miss.

427
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:36,444
Well, boys, looks like
an early winter.

428
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:39,072
- You all right?
- Of course she's all right.

429
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,115
Just having us some fun is all.

430
00:27:41,324 --> 00:27:43,910
You said, "Good evening,"
now you can say good night.

431
00:27:44,077 --> 00:27:47,163
- Greely Clegg!
- Well, he knows the rules.

432
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,124
Ain't no soldiers allowed
in this camp after sundown.

433
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:53,962
- Sorry, but I'm afraid I'm here on duty.
- You ought to be ashamed.

434
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:56,798
After the lieutenant brought
Mr. McCabe here to help us.

435
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:59,175
We ain't asking for no help...

436
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:01,803
...McCabe's nor the Army's.

437
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,390
Just to be let do
the thing we come here to do.

438
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:08,685
But no. Mustn't rile the Comanches.

439
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:10,728
Sit tight, they say.

440
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:12,772
While you Yankee blue-bellies...

441
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:16,401
...go parading up and down
as big as you please...

442
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:19,404
...we're sitting here waiting
for you to find one man.

443
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:21,239
One man, mind you.

444
00:28:21,406 --> 00:28:24,742
And he's supposed to do
what all us put together couldn't do.

445
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,327
Good evening, miss.

446
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:28,746
How much is he
paying you, Yankee...

447
00:28:28,913 --> 00:28:32,709
...out of what he's claiming
to ransom our kinfolk?

448
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:43,052
There's only one way I'd like
to answer that question...

449
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:46,139
...but I'd have to be
out of uniform and off duty.

450
00:28:46,264 --> 00:28:48,558
Right now, I'm neither.

451
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,020
By the way...

452
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:56,816
...if you'd like to repeat that question,
be at the post armoury at 4 tomorrow.

453
00:28:57,025 --> 00:29:00,028
- I'll be there.
- And I'll be off duty.

454
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:02,655
Of all the contemptible,
mean-minded...

455
00:29:02,864 --> 00:29:05,200
...ungrateful men I've ever met.

456
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,995
There you be, Greely.
You know, that fits you to a T.

457
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:12,290
Reckon now that means I get
the first dance, huh, Miss Marty?

458
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:14,667
Go wash your faces.

459
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:18,421
And your mouths too. Go on, scoot!

460
00:30:21,192 --> 00:30:22,527
Now, Martha...

461
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:25,530
...stop torturing yourself.

462
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,198
Why don't you let me have that?

463
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:30,076
Let me give it away.
Or better yet, destroy it.

464
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,047
What did Mr. McCabe say?

465
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:46,050
Nothing much. Mostly, he listened.

466
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:48,928
I thought you'd be at the dance.

467
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,389
I'll tell you what.

468
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,725
You put on that pretty pink dress
of yours...

469
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:55,894
...and we'll go to the dance together.

470
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:02,192
It'd be good for you
to have some fun...

471
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:04,736
...mix more with the young people.

472
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,365
I'd rather not, Father.

473
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:16,247
Well, I think I'll turn in.

474
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,795
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Father.

475
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:25,256
I won't have those people exploited...

476
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:28,718
...milked of every last dollar
to line McCabe's pockets.

477
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:31,513
He'll get chief scout's pay
and not one cent more.

478
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,098
- I thought you agreed to...
- I agreed to nothing.

479
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:36,351
The man's a scoundrel.

480
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,603
I'll use him and kick him out.

481
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:41,356
Mr. Gary, I'm placing you
on detached duty.

482
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:43,816
You'll take those settlers
as far as Oak Creek...

483
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:45,944
...the limit of our patrol area.

484
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,404
- Sergeant Posey will accompany you.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,449
Posey will remain with orders
to bring them back here...

486
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:53,493
...if you don't return in three days.

487
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,788
- Is that clear?
- Well, no. Not entirely.

488
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:58,414
Return from where?

489
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:01,543
I'm ordering you to volunteer
to go with McCabe...

490
00:32:01,668 --> 00:32:03,294
...and meet with Quanah Parker.

491
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,630
Well, what about the treaty?

492
00:32:05,838 --> 00:32:07,465
The department's orders?

493
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:11,845
They can scarcely apply
to a deserter out of uniform.

494
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,307
If you don't return, mister, that's
exactly what will show on your record.

495
00:32:16,474 --> 00:32:20,854
If I don't return, it won't make much
difference what shows on my record.

496
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:24,065
When am I ordered to desert, sir?

497
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,276
I don't know
what you're talking about.

498
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:28,444
Get out of here.

499
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:31,614
Thank you, sir.

500
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,492
Good evening, Jim.
Where are you going?

501
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:36,703
To desert.

502
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:19,996
Hey, isn't that pretty heavy?

503
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:22,081
Better let me help you.

504
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:23,875
Oh, it's not too heavy.

505
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:26,252
Looks heavy enough from here.

506
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:29,839
There.

507
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:53,112
That's our wagon over there.

508
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,697
All right.

509
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:58,409
Oh, say...

510
00:33:58,618 --> 00:34:01,287
...you picked a good spot too.

511
00:34:01,454 --> 00:34:03,289
Out of the wind.

512
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:07,502
Far enough from the crick so you
won't get too many mosquitoes.

513
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:11,381
Near a dead tree
that'll keep you in firewood.

514
00:34:11,798 --> 00:34:14,217
You're an old trail hand.

515
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:22,725
Well, maybe not too old.

516
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:26,563
Have you been in the Army
very long, sir?

517
00:34:26,729 --> 00:34:30,149
The name's Jim. Jim Gary.

518
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:33,444
Yeah, about nine years.

519
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:38,533
What's the matter?

520
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,955
It was just nine years ago
that my brother was captured.

521
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,707
Oh, I was up north then.

522
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:49,878
- Montana territory. I just got out...
- It was my fault, you know.

523
00:34:50,336 --> 00:34:53,673
- What do you mean?
- I was supposed to look after him.

524
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,968
When the Indians came, I ran and hid.

525
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,387
He was only 8 years old.

526
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,348
How old were you?

527
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,477
Thirteen, I think.

528
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:07,896
Yes.

529
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:10,648
Where was your father
and the others?

530
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:15,028
Hadn't been any Indians within 50
miles. He'd gone to visit a neighbour.

531
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:16,738
They weren't even touched.

532
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:19,365
It was a small raiding party, I guess.

533
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,076
I was still hiding
when Father came home...

534
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:23,953
...too frightened to come out...

535
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,414
...after I knew the Comanches
had ridden away.

536
00:35:27,665 --> 00:35:29,709
<i>Well, it...</i>

537
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,420
It sounds to me, Miss...?

538
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,297
Marty.

539
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,925
Sounds to me, Miss Marty...

540
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:40,261
...like there wasn't anything
you could have done anyway.

541
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:44,557
Except get captured yourself.

542
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:50,104
I have a picture of him.

543
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:55,610
Do you think you could get Mr. McCabe
to look at it before he goes?

544
00:35:56,694 --> 00:35:58,947
I'll make sure he does.

545
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:01,491
I'll get it.

546
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:10,124
Real Pennsylvania rye.

547
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,126
If you don't say
that's good whiskey...

548
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,587
...my name isn't Wringle,
Henry J. Wringle.

549
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:20,260
That's Henry J. All right.

550
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:22,053
Yes, sir.

551
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,889
- Now, what about this boy of yours?
- No, no, no.

552
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,059
Not my boy, my wife's.

553
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:29,936
By her first husband.

554
00:36:30,103 --> 00:36:34,357
See, I promised her I'd do everything
I could to find that boy of hers.

555
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:38,069
In fact, I... I had to give her my word
on it before she'd marry me.

556
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,321
Well, that seems natural enough.

557
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:43,074
Oh, yes, yes, it's natural.

558
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:47,203
But it certainly isn't practical.
Not when you've got a business to run.

559
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,330
Now, this journey.

560
00:36:49,497 --> 00:36:51,457
Why, this thing could
go on for months.

561
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:54,335
All these people setting
these camps up every night...

562
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:55,753
...eight, nine miles... No.

563
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,631
I just haven't got
that kind of time to waste.

564
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:00,425
Well, maybe you'll be lucky.

565
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:02,135
McCabe...

566
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:05,430
...I've always been a man
that made his own luck.

567
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:07,891
And if I'm any judge of character...

568
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,976
...so have you.

569
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:15,690
You know, my wife hasn't seen
that boy of hers since he was 2.

570
00:37:16,024 --> 00:37:18,193
Be 17 now.

571
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:20,320
McCabe...

572
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:24,490
...I will guarantee that you
could bring in any boy that age...

573
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:26,910
...tell my wife that it was her son...

574
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:30,163
...she'd accept him without question.

575
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,707
And then you could get back
to your business.

576
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,669
Then I could get back
to my business.

577
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:39,339
I'd be willing to give 1000...

578
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:42,759
- Five hundred dollars for...
- You said 1000.

579
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:47,305
All right, I'll make it 1000.

580
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:52,268
And, McCabe, any boy would do,
you know?

581
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,730
Well, he'd have a good home,
get an education.

582
00:37:55,897 --> 00:37:58,983
- What's wrong with that?
- Not a thing.

583
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:01,236
Not a thing, Mr. Wringle.

584
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:03,947
Maybe in time, he'd grow up
to be a man like you.

585
00:38:04,113 --> 00:38:05,657
- You bet your life.
- All right.

586
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:07,033
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

587
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,164
- Fine, thanks a lot.
- I'll take the keg, to bind it, huh?

588
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,458
All right, you can go...

589
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:18,336
- Hello, lieutenant.
- Interrupting something?

590
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:22,841
Oh, no, no, no. I was just wishing
Mr. McCabe good luck.

591
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:26,010
- Good luck, McCabe.
- Yes, sir.

592
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,680
Yes, sir, Mr. Wringle.

593
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:31,432
Yes, sir.

594
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,309
That was Mr. Wringle.

595
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:36,771
- Happy fella, isn't he?
- Mr. Wringle.

596
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,524
You know, that's the trouble
with the world today.

597
00:38:39,691 --> 00:38:41,276
There are too many Wringles.

598
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:43,778
Why, they're just all Wringles
all over the place.

599
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:48,032
There are too many Wringles in the
bed, there are Wringles in your shirts...

600
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,578
...there are Wringles in your face.
There are too many Wringles.

601
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:54,122
You better give me this keg.
You've had enough.

602
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:57,208
We're pulling out of here
in the morning, you know.

603
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,878
- We?
- We.

604
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:03,298
What, was this Frazer's idea
or was it your idea?

605
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:05,925
Major Frazer. Direct orders.

606
00:39:06,134 --> 00:39:08,720
- Doesn't he trust me?
- Who does?

607
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:10,889
Does he think
I ought to have a chaperone?

608
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:12,807
- Probably. You need one.
- I need one?

609
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,435
I got enough trouble trying
to keep my own scalp...

610
00:39:15,602 --> 00:39:18,188
...without having to try
and look after your scalp.

611
00:39:18,354 --> 00:39:20,356
Look, you don't have
to worry about me.

612
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:23,276
I can take care of myself.
There's no point in arguing.

613
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,820
There's no point in arguing.
I'm going with you.

614
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:28,531
- You've seen very few Indians...
- Now, wait a minute.

615
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:32,285
- When were you planning to pull out?
- I was planning to pull out at sunup.

616
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:35,455
All right, change your plans
and pull out a little before.

617
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:37,916
I don't want people
to know I've gone with you.

618
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:39,542
Yes, sir!

619
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:42,045
- Yes, sir! Lieutenant, yes, sir!
- Oh, cut it out!

620
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:44,714
- Is there any other orders?
- Stop acting like a fool.

621
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:48,092
Is there any other orders?
If there are no further orders...

622
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:51,763
- Knock it off, will you! - Is it
all right if my friend and I go out?

623
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,973
And I go someplace
where it's quiet...

624
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,684
...and drink to all
the Wringles in the world?

625
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:58,394
Look, cut it out, Guthrie.

626
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:00,438
We've been friends too long.

627
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:03,483
Whatever gave you that idea?

628
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,200
- Hiya, Posey.
- Evening, sir.

629
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,870
- Did you have a good supper?
- Oh, yeah, fine. You seen McCabe?

630
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,041
Oh, him. He's over at
the old Hickman place with a keg.

631
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,459
That figures.

632
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:24,379
There's some coffee over there
if you'd like to join Dad.

633
00:40:24,546 --> 00:40:27,507
- Well, thank you, ma'am.
- I'll see you.

634
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:34,639
<i>- Well...
- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

635
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:38,017
Now, if you two want to stroll down
lover's lane holding hands...

636
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:41,062
...you can do it someplace else,
because this is my room.

637
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:43,523
I'm sorry,
we didn't mean to startle you.

638
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,151
Well, the least you could've done is
knock, because this is my room.

639
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:51,281
Now, wait a minute. She wanted to ask
you something special before you left.

640
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,157
- Is that so?
- Yeah, that's so.

641
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:54,951
This picture.

642
00:40:57,328 --> 00:41:00,498
It's my brother,
the one we're looking for.

643
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:04,294
Of course, he was very young there,
but it's all I have...

644
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,379
...and I thought it might help you.

645
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:11,551
How long has it been
since that picture was taken?

646
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:13,761
At least 12 years.

647
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:15,847
I think he'd be about 17 now.

648
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:17,974
About 17?

649
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:20,768
About 17.

650
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:26,608
You... You give me a picture of
a curly headed 5-year-old kid...

651
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:28,443
...with velvet knee-britches...

652
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,362
...and you think it'll help, huh?

653
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:36,075
Would you like me to tell you
what this little angel looks like now?

654
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,995
- Come on, Guthrie, cut it out.
- No, no, no. Let her know.

655
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,539
It's about time somebody
in this camp knows.

656
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:44,959
Here. Here. Now, let me...
Let me tell you something.

657
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:46,878
Do you...?

658
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:50,673
That kid has braids
down to here now.

659
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,092
Stiff, stinking braids...

660
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:55,053
...filled with buffalo grease.

661
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,764
And he's got a scar there,
right in his shoulder...

662
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:01,059
...where they stuck the pins
right in through his flesh.

663
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:04,354
Then took some rawhide ropes
and hung him up like that...

664
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:07,649
...so he'd sort of dangle like that
until the kid tore himself...

665
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:11,194
...off these pins
just to prove he's a man.

666
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:13,363
He forgot his English.

667
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,615
He just grunts Comanche now.

668
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,242
Just grunts.

669
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,285
And he's killed.

670
00:42:19,452 --> 00:42:22,455
And he's taken scalps,
white man's scalps.

671
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:25,542
And given the chance,
sister, he'd rape you.

672
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:27,961
- I told you to cut it out!
- Now you... You hush.

673
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:32,632
- I'm not gonna hush. Just shut up!
- I'm talking to the lady. You hush.

674
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:36,010
When he's finished, he'd trade you off
to one of the other bucks...

675
00:42:36,177 --> 00:42:38,388
...for a good knife or a bad rifle.

676
00:42:38,596 --> 00:42:42,183
Now, is that what you want me
to bring back to you, huh?

677
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,688
Is that what you want?

678
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:50,066
Why, you no...

679
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,279
Why didn't you knock her down and
kick her teeth in while you were at it?

680
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:56,197
How about a snort before you go?

681
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,241
Hey, Jim.

682
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:01,452
Jim!

683
00:43:01,828 --> 00:43:04,956
- Jim!
- Marty. Marty, listen.

684
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:07,750
That was the whiskey talking,
not McCabe.

685
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:09,377
So forget it, please.

686
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:11,087
Put it right out of your mind.

687
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:15,425
No, it wasn't the whiskey.
It was the truth.

688
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,343
I'm a fool for...

689
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,472
For crying over someone who
died nine years ago.

690
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:26,102
But I can't help it.

691
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:40,575
You leave her be.

692
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:42,869
Go on back to camp, Miss Marty.

693
00:43:43,077 --> 00:43:47,290
I'll go and come when I please,
Mr. Clegg, and with whom I please.

694
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:51,461
Well, then you'll oblige me
by stepping aside.

695
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:54,214
Now, Yank...

696
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,550
...I know this ain't
what you call your armoury...

697
00:43:57,717 --> 00:44:00,386
...and you got on your soldier suit
and all that...

698
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:04,599
...but I don't reckon hugging my gal
comes under the heading of duty.

699
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:07,602
I'm not your girl,
never have been nor will be.

700
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:10,480
Well, that remains to be solved.

701
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,983
Now, why don't you and me
just step out here a piece...

702
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:15,902
...and we'll get this thing started.

703
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,404
Get away, you stupid idiot.

704
00:44:18,571 --> 00:44:20,907
- He shoved you, Greely.
- I know he shoved me.

705
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:22,575
I know he done it. I seen it.

706
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:25,036
- You fellas gonna fight?
- Yes, Mr. McCabe.

707
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:26,412
Let me hold your coat.

708
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:29,832
- Here, give me your coat.
- Much obliged.

709
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,295
What are we looking for?

710
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:38,299
Looking for a chip
for him to knock off my shoulder.

711
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:41,302
Well, here, try him.

712
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:45,098
Thank you.

713
00:44:47,058 --> 00:44:50,270
- Hey, hey. I'll hold that.
- Thank you.

714
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,857
- Fight fair, Jim. Fight fair.
- McCabe, you keep quiet!

715
00:44:54,023 --> 00:44:56,401
I'm telling you, just shut up!
That's all.

716
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,779
I dare you to knock that piece
of firewood off my shoulder.

717
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:03,116
Go on, Jim, knock that piece
of firewood off his shoulder.

718
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:05,702
- I'm handling this.
- You stop this and go on home!

719
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,329
Marty, you stay over there.
Everything is going...

720
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:11,958
- Knock that piece of firewood off!
- Stay out of this!

721
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:14,586
Why don't you two knotheads go on
back to camp...

722
00:45:14,752 --> 00:45:16,504
...and wash up or something.

723
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,591
Come on, help me, Ortho! Get up!

724
00:45:20,508 --> 00:45:23,052
Jim, you just ain't half trying.

725
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,266
Hey, Greely, I've got him!

726
00:45:28,474 --> 00:45:30,268
I've got the scissors hold on him.

727
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:33,354
Ortho, it's me. You dumbbell!

728
00:45:33,646 --> 00:45:35,648
Mr. McCabe! They're killing him!

729
00:45:35,815 --> 00:45:37,609
- It's two against one.
- Two?

730
00:45:37,775 --> 00:45:40,320
I thought there were four of them.

731
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:45,867
My leg!

732
00:45:46,784 --> 00:45:49,370
- You dumbbell.
- Ma'am.

733
00:45:49,537 --> 00:45:52,248
You're... You're obstructing my view.

734
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:56,127
Come on, Jim.
You're going great, Jim.

735
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:03,218
Foul. Jim.

736
00:46:03,384 --> 00:46:04,719
Foul.

737
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,973
Sergeant Posey! Daddy!
They're killing Mr. Gary.

738
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,235
Choke him, Ortho! Choke him
till his eyeballs pop out.

739
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,155
Hey, that's my brother
you just poked.

740
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:38,920
I can't swim.

741
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,382
Come on, Greely.

742
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,468
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Really, it's nothing.

743
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,012
This hand is cut.
I've got to put ointment on it.

744
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:49,222
It's just a scratch.

745
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,975
Sir, it'd give me pleasure
to take those two tackies...

746
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,434
Forget it.

747
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:56,521
They've never been anything
but trouble since we started out.

748
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,740
Come on, Posey.

749
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:11,578
- What is it?
- Could be Comanche!

750
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:14,247
What is it?

751
00:47:14,497 --> 00:47:16,249
Godless Comanches.

752
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:19,210
- I killed one.
- All right.

753
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,302
Mrs. McCandless!

754
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:30,972
Toby!

755
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:34,267
Mr. McCandless, that's your wife!

756
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:39,022
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Toby! It's my little boy!

757
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,816
That was the wind you heard,
that's all. Now, come on.

758
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,777
Come, baby! Come, Toby!

759
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:47,030
Toby, come to Mama!

760
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,158
- My baby!
- Relax.

761
00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:53,494
Toby.

762
00:47:54,412 --> 00:47:57,248
It was my baby. Oh, Marty, help me.

763
00:47:57,415 --> 00:48:01,711
Help me. It's my little boy,
he's across the river. He needs me.

764
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:06,132
The Indians will get him!
He needs me! The Indians!

765
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:11,971
Clegg, if you and those two idiot sons
of yours cause any more trouble...

766
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:14,974
...I'm gonna have you
slapped in irons!

767
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,040
Hiya, Guth!

768
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,088
Pull up a chair,
have yourself some breakfast.

769
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,513
Had mine about an hour ago.

770
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:00,812
Little morning coffee?

771
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:07,569
There's one thing
we ought to get straight, though.

772
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:12,323
From now on, we take turns
doing the cooking.

773
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,576
Oh, yeah.

774
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,872
Yeah, and there's one thing more
we ought to get straight.

775
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:22,166
From now on, we ride together.

776
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,752
Is that clear?

777
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,299
Well, it's your scalp.

778
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,846
Your scalp.

779
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:41,144
You're crazy fool enough to risk it
for $80 a month, that's your luck, huh.

780
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,355
But don't buck me, Jim.

781
00:49:44,522 --> 00:49:47,692
Don't buck me. Don't interfere.

782
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,404
I'll do the talking,
I'll do the trading, not you.

783
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,615
Well, you sure do plenty of talking.

784
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,617
That's right.

785
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:04,292
Well, you make lousy coffee,
I'll tell you that for sure.

786
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,252
You...?

787
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,546
You talk good Comanche, huh?

788
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,299
I do all right, don't worry.

789
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,552
Well, you better start talking.

790
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,144
Remember now, I'll do the talking.

791
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,486
Quanah Parker.

792
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,738
You know me.

793
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,167
Quanah.

794
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:30,253
Quanah, this is my partner here.

795
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,048
This is Jim Gary.
He's from up north, Montana way.

796
00:51:34,215 --> 00:51:37,385
He's good friend.

797
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,971
Brain, big brain.

798
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,141
Lie.

799
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,270
Soldier. I see him before.

800
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,320
Well, you got a good memory.

801
00:51:55,612 --> 00:52:00,116
Yeah, I was with Major Frazer last year
when you signed the peace treaty.

802
00:52:00,366 --> 00:52:03,620
Now you break treaty.
You come here.

803
00:52:03,828 --> 00:52:05,580
No, no. No, I'm not in uniform.

804
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,416
You see, my coming here
has nothing to do with the Army.

805
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,502
We're here to trade.

806
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,755
- Yeah.
- Show him, McCabe.

807
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,381
You're still giving the orders?

808
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:19,260
Quanah, I'd like to talk
a little business with you.

809
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:23,890
We've got two pack horses here,
first-class, pretty merchandise.

810
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,143
- Oh, you.
- Oh, you.

811
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,202
Give me the white men.

812
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:30,206
I give the orders, not you.

813
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,188
We'll see who gives the orders.

814
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,818
Take them to a lodge.

815
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,373
You would have to come along.

816
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,253
Why didn't you tell me you'd met
Quanah Parker before?

817
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:20,298
There must have been
50 other officers at that parley.

818
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,258
He never even looked in my direction.

819
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,385
- Not much.
- No, he didn't.

820
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:29,724
Hey, who was the skinhead out there,
the troublemaker?

821
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,810
Stone Calf.
He's head of the Buffalo Shields.

822
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:35,897
They're some kind of a
warrior society.

823
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,525
Just for your information,
he claimed our scalps...

824
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:40,360
...for crossing the treaty lines.

825
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,113
Put your trust in the Lord,
young man.

826
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,158
- That's what I did.
- Who are you?

827
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,162
Now? Nakotah's woman.

828
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,624
My real name is Hannah.

829
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,752
Hannah Clegg.

830
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:00,547
I had a husband once.

831
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,758
And two sons.

832
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:06,219
Greely and Ortho.

833
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,304
Yes!

834
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,557
Do you know? You know my boys?

835
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:12,976
We... We sure do.

836
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,978
They're... They're fine boys.

837
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:16,688
Both of them.

838
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,481
They're full-grown men now.

839
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,609
They've come back
with their father to look for you.

840
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,528
Oh, no.

841
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,447
No. They must never do that.

842
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,658
- Why?
- They must never find me. Never.

843
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,786
You'd rather be listed as dead?

844
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,250
I am dead.

845
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:41,004
Ma'am, are there any other
white prisoners in camp?

846
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,384
Running Wolf.

847
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,512
And the girl, Wah-kay-nah.

848
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,222
She has two young'uns.

849
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,266
No others?

850
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,479
Mostly dead.

851
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:02,442
Some sold off in Mexico.

852
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,654
- Oh, I gotta go now. I gotta go.
- Mrs. Clegg.

853
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,157
I'm sorry.

854
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,456
Stone Calf's woman.

855
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,751
Stone Calf's woman, she's white.

856
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:24,714
But don't tell them about me.
No, please, don't tell them.

857
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,948
Well, I see you've been taking a look
at our merchandise.

858
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:37,996
It is many years since I trade
for glass beads and red flannel.

859
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,960
What do you want for these, McCabe?

860
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,462
Well, just before we start the trading...

861
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:51,259
...I'd like you to know that I don't enjoy
being treated like a prisoner.

862
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,762
I came here of my own free will,
and I want your promise...

863
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,558
...that we can leave the same way,
all in one piece.

864
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,145
Now, of course, if Stone Calf's
the new head man around here...

865
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,272
...maybe I ought to be talking to him.

866
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,524
Stone Calf.

867
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:11,404
He still says words over buffalo shield
to turn away bullets.

868
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,990
But we know different, don't we?

869
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,533
All right.

870
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,036
Now that brings up
an interesting question.

871
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,747
I understand he has a white wife.
Is that right?

872
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,832
One of the captives?

873
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,630
As a matter of fact, Quanah, this...
That's the reason we're here.

874
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,798
We want to buy back some captives.

875
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,761
We want to buy back a boy
named Running Wolf.

876
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:38,640
Want a girl named...
What was the name of that girl?

877
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,684
- Wah-kay-nah.
- Wah-kay-nah.

878
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,605
We also want to buy back
Stone Calf's woman.

879
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,030
Handles real nice, doesn't it?

880
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,909
I imagine a repeater like that
would come in mighty handy...

881
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,788
...if you ever had to have a showdown
with a troublemaker like Stone Calf.

882
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,002
You think it over.

883
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,964
Think it over, Quanah.
Take your time.

884
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:27,313
That's Stone Calf, huh?

885
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,983
Big medicine.

886
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,079
Why am I taken?

887
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,665
I send you back to your people.

888
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:50,211
No, I am a Comanche!
No, I'm no white man.

889
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:56,092
- Is he white?
- Boy is white.

890
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,136
Wah-kay-nah.

891
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,937
What's your name?

892
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,358
Is it...? Is it Freda?

893
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,611
Freda?

894
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,905
Can you speak English?

895
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,741
Freda.

896
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,619
Don't you remember? Fre...

897
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,084
- Freda Knudsen.
- Freda Knudsen.

898
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,713
Sixteen the fourth of August.

899
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,132
I've had enough of this.
Let's forget it.

900
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,843
Yeah, the time to forget it
was before we started.

901
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,763
I'm gonna take that kid
back to Henry J. Wringle.

902
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:46,267
All right, squeeze what you can
out of Henry J. Wringle, but she stays.

903
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,810
- Wait!
- All right.

904
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,940
- You make trade for one more.
- No, no, Quanah.

905
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,193
Looks like you're gonna have
to handle Stone Calf yourself.

906
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,028
Now, that shouldn't be too hard.

907
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:00,406
- Six more rifles.
- All right, six more rifles. Come on.

908
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,408
Come on!

909
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,906
You made trade with me, McCabe.

910
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,368
- I keep the rifles.
- All right.

911
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,746
All right, I'll stick to my end
of the bargain.

912
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,626
- You trust me, don't you, Quanah?
- No.

913
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,473
Well, who are you?

914
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,187
I am Stone Calf's woman.

915
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,731
Well, that's no white woman.
She's a squaw.

916
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,441
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

917
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,110
No, wait a minute.
That's no Comanche.

918
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,115
How do they call you, señorita?

919
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,412
- Elena.
- Elena, huh?

920
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:33,041
Elena. Well, that'll do for now.

921
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,751
Stone Calf know about this?

922
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,545
No. But he will find out.

923
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,714
And when he does,
he will follow, señor.

924
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,258
Of that you may be sure.

925
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:44,886
If you are wise,
you will send me back.

926
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,804
You mean, you want to go back?

927
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:50,350
It does not matter.

928
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,686
For five years, I have been
Stone Calf's woman.

929
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,272
His squaw.

930
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,235
I'm not worth fighting for.

931
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,989
All right, come on. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

932
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,534
Well, are you coming or aren't you?

933
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:11,204
Stone Calf will never let me go.
He will kill you both!

934
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,833
Yeah, I know. All right now, you can
stay here or you can come with us.

935
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,085
It makes no difference to us.
Come on.

936
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,446
All right, hold it.

937
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,368
Well, this looks like
as good a place as any.

938
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,745
We'll stop here.

939
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,375
Señorita, how about you rustling up
some firewood?

940
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,211
I could do with a pot of coffee.

941
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,726
You're not gonna build a fire.

942
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,730
Why don't you send up
smoke signals while you're at it?

943
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,899
I can't spell.

944
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,904
Let me set you straight.

945
01:04:26,321 --> 01:04:28,406
While there's daylight, we travel.

946
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,075
- All right, you go ahead.
- What are you gonna do?

947
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,536
Sit here and wait for him
to catch up with you?

948
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,121
Yeah, something like that.

949
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,998
Unless you've got some better ideas.

950
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,751
What, with all that
West Point training of yours...

951
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,920
...maybe you think
we ought to surround him.

952
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,214
Oh, come on, use your head.

953
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:48,635
Killing Stone Calf or him killing us
could set off another Comanche war.

954
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:52,764
All right, if I get killed I kind of hope
maybe they will set off another war.

955
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,266
I'm not gonna argue, McCabe.
I'm giving an order!

956
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:58,061
Well, I've taken just about
all the orders I can stand.

957
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,730
- You don't bluff me with that!
- Now, wait a minute.

958
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,982
Just a minute, Jim.

959
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,818
Just a minute.

960
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,780
Now, you think back.

961
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,491
Now, I haven't drawn on
very many men...

962
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:16,120
...but when I did I wasn't bluffing,
and I'm not bluffing now.

963
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,167
Now, don't you make me prove it.

964
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:26,965
I'm giving you fair warning, McCabe.

965
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:30,260
I'll jump you the first chance I get.

966
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:34,722
You're just bull-headed enough
to do it, aren't you?

967
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,183
Aren't you?

968
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:46,192
All right, Jim, you want to go on ahead,
I want to stay here. We'll split up.

969
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,778
- You take young Wringle with you.
- What about her?

970
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:51,698
Hey, señorita, come here.

971
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,992
Now, he's going on ahead,
I'm gonna stay here.

972
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,535
What do you wanna do?

973
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,621
- I stay with you.
- There you are.

974
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:05,378
Now, remember, McCabe...

975
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,047
...don't expect any help.

976
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,383
When I leave here, I'm gone.

977
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,387
- And I won't be back.
- Good riddance. Come on.

978
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,598
Keep an eye on junior, Jim!

979
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:20,018
You know he's worth
1000 bucks to me!

980
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,607
Go on. Go on.
Get the fire ready. Go on.

981
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,374
William.

982
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:44,834
That's him.

983
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:48,546
Good morning, sir.

984
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,551
I believe this is what you wanted.

985
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,815
Posey.

986
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,817
Yes, sir.

987
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,378
Toby! Toby!

988
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,655
All right, now that's enough.
Keep going.

989
01:07:56,114 --> 01:08:00,076
All right, file by and take a look
if you want to, but keep going.

990
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,590
One boy's not gonna satisfy
those people. What can I tell them?

991
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,509
How can I convince them
there's no hope for the others?

992
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:19,220
- It happens to be the truth, sir.
- It's not the truth.

993
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,181
Not when you admit
talking to Mrs...

994
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:24,934
What's her name? The wife of that
bible-thumper, Mrs. Clegg.

995
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:28,563
- You disobeyed orders, Mr. Gary.
- Yes, sir.

996
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,816
And you stood by while McCabe
traded weapons with Quanah Parker.

997
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:33,359
Yes, sir.

998
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,987
Now you're willing to condone
a further deception...

999
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:38,698
...by passing off Running Wolf
as the Wringle boy...

1000
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,992
...when there's not
a particle of proof he is.

1001
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,621
- He fits the description.
- Well, he fits a half-dozen descriptions.

1002
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,331
No, sir.

1003
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,333
Not going to be a party to any fraud.

1004
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,960
Let McCabe whistle
for his blood money.

1005
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,254
For all we know,
he'll never come back anyway.

1006
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,507
Sir, I promised.

1007
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:59,344
He earned the money, even if
he never gets a chance to spend it.

1008
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:02,555
I see no reason to honour
a promise to a dead man...

1009
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:06,184
...when it entails
a cruel lie to the living.

1010
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,770
I'll handle this in my way, mister.

1011
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,730
Yes, sir.

1012
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,734
Jim, I know you did
what you thought best.

1013
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,321
By trying to spare people pain
you can sometimes cause more.

1014
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:22,408
This was a job for a hard man.
That's why I picked McCabe.

1015
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:27,163
I thought he might be able to teach you
something I've never been able to.

1016
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,082
Well, what's that, sir?

1017
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,627
That only God
has the right to play God.

1018
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:57,819
- What? Why, you dirty, rotten gut...
- Come on. Come on now, that's enough.

1019
01:09:57,986 --> 01:10:00,280
- Comanche... Get off of me!
- Move him out.

1020
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,657
- Come on.
- What kind of an army you got here?

1021
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,243
I'm a decent taxpayer,
and no dirty, rotten...

1022
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:12,876
He was an officer
in the American Army.

1023
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,880
Lieutenant Thompson.

1024
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:22,260
<i>We met at this baile, this dance...</i>

1025
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,637
Veracruz?

1026
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:30,560
My father had been transferred there
from the presidio at San Fernando.

1027
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,521
<i>We...</i>

1028
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,523
We danced.

1029
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,442
We laughed.

1030
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:42,113
<i>- And you fell in love.
- Sí, we became engaged.</i>

1031
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:50,038
And so, on my 17th birthday,
we began the journey.

1032
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:55,084
My father, an escort of dragoons
from his regiment...

1033
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,795
<i>...my dueña.</i>

1034
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,341
Well, do you have no mother?

1035
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,801
No.

1036
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,305
She died when I was very young.

1037
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,185
Two days after we had crossed
the Rio Bravo...

1038
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:18,316
<i>...the Comanches...</i>

1039
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,369
Did you hear something?

1040
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,706
No. No.

1041
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,960
No, I didn't hear anything.

1042
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,051
Say, why don't you come over here
and sit down?

1043
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,053
Over here.

1044
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,974
Sit over here.

1045
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,313
No, no. Look, over here.

1046
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,737
There, that's better.

1047
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:09,701
It's a little more companionable
like that.

1048
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,413
Being a dark night and all that.

1049
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:21,004
You don't mind if I put my arm
around you, do you?

1050
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,178
<i>Now...</i>

1051
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,972
Now, go on with your story now.

1052
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,934
What were you saying?

1053
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,061
The Comanches attacked?

1054
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:05,173
Shut up!

1055
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:33,701
Go on, the horses.

1056
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,637
<i>Now, I want to...</i>

1057
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,139
I assume that you've
all had an opportunity...

1058
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:58,768
...to look at this captive boy
Lieutenant Gary brought in.

1059
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:03,147
And I want to say to all of you
that we haven't the slightest inkling...

1060
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:05,191
...as to this boy's identity.

1061
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,694
That's my boy. That's my Toby.

1062
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:11,739
Or where, or how,
or even when he was captured.

1063
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,200
Certainly must've been very young.

1064
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:17,078
He neither speaks nor understands
a word of English.

1065
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:20,874
Major, may I have a word, please?

1066
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,834
Do you think it possible...

1067
01:14:23,001 --> 01:14:28,673
...that an older boy, say 7 or 8, could
forget his English so completely?

1068
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:32,886
Well, I wouldn't say it was likely,
Mr. Purcell, but certainly possible.

1069
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:35,180
Hearing nothing
but Comanche for 10 years.

1070
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,348
Living like one.
Getting to think like one.

1071
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,850
Yes, I've known cases.

1072
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:41,352
- Please, Mr...
- Stand him up.

1073
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,982
- Get up there, Injun!
- Watch it! Watch it!

1074
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:53,573
Well, anyone here
want to claim him?

1075
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:57,452
Oh, no. Not me.

1076
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:00,872
You couldn't pay me
to take in a mad dog like that.

1077
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,334
I say we've come
on a fool's errand, all of us.

1078
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:09,547
Let the dead past bury its dead.
Let's go back home where we belong.

1079
01:15:13,635 --> 01:15:16,304
You sure you didn't see my Freda?

1080
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:18,848
She was 9 year old.
Blue eyes, gold hair...

1081
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:23,561
No. No, Mr. Knudsen,
I told you, I didn't see her.

1082
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:31,152
I say we should go back home
where we belong.

1083
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:33,738
I agree with Mr. Wringle.

1084
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:36,741
I've thought so
for a long time, Marty.

1085
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:39,869
If this unfortunate boy is an example
of what we can expect...

1086
01:15:40,078 --> 01:15:42,288
...then I say we're too late.

1087
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:44,958
Major, give him his freedom.

1088
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,503
Send him back
to the only life he knows.

1089
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:50,755
Why, no.

1090
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:54,008
Why, no, you can't send him back.
That's my boy.

1091
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,178
Why, Marty,
you know that's my Toby.

1092
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:00,557
William, tell them that's our Toby.

1093
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,725
Oh, William, don't let them
send him away!

1094
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:06,187
- Don't let them send him away!
- Relax now. They won't send him away.

1095
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,940
- Toby!
- Mrs. McCandless, please.

1096
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,775
- Marty, that's my Toby!
- Easy, lad.

1097
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,737
I'll take the boy, sir,
since no one else wants him.

1098
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,074
Do you really think he might be
your son, McCandless?

1099
01:16:18,783 --> 01:16:21,536
Between the two of us, no, sir.

1100
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:25,415
But if you ask me again
I'll swear on the Bible he is.

1101
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:31,087
Major, my Mary ain't ever gonna
know what's real and what ain't.

1102
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,506
But if I can give her
comfort in a lie...

1103
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,885
...I'm sure God won't kick me
out of heaven for it.

1104
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,721
So with your consent, sir...

1105
01:16:39,888 --> 01:16:44,142
...I'll take our Toby
and do the best I can for him.

1106
01:16:44,559 --> 01:16:46,895
Well, you're taking on
a serious responsibility...

1107
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:48,396
...and a dangerous one.

1108
01:16:48,563 --> 01:16:50,815
But he's yours.
Good luck to you.

1109
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,592
Mrs. Frazer, ma'am!

1110
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,387
Mrs. Frazer, on the double, please!

1111
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:25,058
You, you're supposed to be dead.

1112
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:28,478
I'm sorry, Slim. I didn't quite make it.

1113
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,280
Come on. Come on.

1114
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:44,452
Mrs. Frazer.

1115
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,454
<i>Marshal McCabe,
we thought you...</i>

1116
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:49,123
Yes, yes, I already heard about that.

1117
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:52,001
I wonder, ma'am,
if you'd take care of her.

1118
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:54,295
Her name's Elena.

1119
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:56,589
Elena de la Madriaga.

1120
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,508
You're very welcome, my dear.

1121
01:17:58,675 --> 01:18:00,552
Thank you, ma'am.

1122
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,644
You are not going to leave?

1123
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,897
<i>No, I wouldn't...</i>

1124
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:16,109
No, I'm not gonna leave.

1125
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:22,907
You go on there.

1126
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:31,207
Come on, marshal,
this will be a pleasure.

1127
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:40,717
Evening, ma'am.

1128
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:42,510
Evening.

1129
01:18:55,023 --> 01:18:56,649
How are you?

1130
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,653
Hi, Reverend.

1131
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,239
Ortho. Greely.

1132
01:19:07,535 --> 01:19:09,496
What's the matter with them?

1133
01:19:11,164 --> 01:19:13,875
Well, I'll be damned.

1134
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,002
Hi, Jim.

1135
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:18,671
Should've stuck around.
Missed the excitement.

1136
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,841
- Yeah, I must've.
- Yeah.

1137
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,843
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait.

1138
01:19:24,052 --> 01:19:27,222
Hold on. Now this kid's supposed
to belong to Henry J. Wringle.

1139
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:30,808
- Oh, and just who says so?
- I do.

1140
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:33,645
I wouldn't take him
if you'd pay me 1000 dollars.

1141
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:36,397
Now, wait a minute, Henry.
You and me made a deal...

1142
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:40,443
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't know what I'm talking about?

1143
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,820
Maybe the major
wants to know what...

1144
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:46,825
The major would, McCabe,
but the matter's been settled.

1145
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,661
The boy's been identified
and claimed by the McCandlesses.

1146
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:53,873
- Well, I'll just straighten you up.
- This is my boy.

1147
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,669
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1148
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:00,880
Wait a minute, what...?

1149
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:04,425
Jim, I told you that Henry J. Wringle
was supposed to get that kid.

1150
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:08,555
Yeah, well, you heard Henry J.
He wouldn't take him as a gift.

1151
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,141
- The matter's been settled, McCabe.
- Oh, you keep out of it.

1152
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,185
You can't address me
in those terms, sir.

1153
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:16,354
What do you mean I can't?

1154
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:20,650
Just because you got that Yankee
soldier suit on, don't... Don't try and...

1155
01:20:20,817 --> 01:20:24,988
- You got no authority over me!
- That's where you're mistaken.

1156
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:26,823
You're still on the Army payroll.

1157
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:29,784
At $80 a month, Guth, remember?

1158
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:33,288
- All right, I quit, I resign. I quit.
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

1159
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,415
- Sure. Why...?
- Mr. Gary...

1160
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:38,334
...put him under house arrest,
till we can talk this over.

1161
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,836
Yes, sir.

1162
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:42,046
Hey, now, wait a...
Now, you listen to me...

1163
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:45,008
No, you listen to me for a change.

1164
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:48,678
Now, you coming along peaceably,
or do I have to get rough?

1165
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,055
Jim!

1166
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:55,476
You see, McCabe,
I don't bluff easy either.

1167
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:57,687
Now, don't make me prove it.

1168
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:00,440
- I've heard of the old Army...
- Sergeant.

1169
01:21:00,607 --> 01:21:02,650
- Yes, sir.
- Remove the body.

1170
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:06,779
- Marshal, this time I'll buy the beer.
- Jim!

1171
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:10,366
Jim, don't... You gonna let them
take me to jail?

1172
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:14,829
Evening, Marty.

1173
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:19,250
Looks like you're about ready.

1174
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:21,794
When do you expect to pull out?

1175
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,588
Sunup.

1176
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:27,634
So much left to pack, I don't know
where we're gonna put it all.

1177
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,178
<i>Well...</i>

1178
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:33,431
I haven't seen one of these things
in years.

1179
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:40,313
It was my brother's.

1180
01:21:40,522 --> 01:21:43,024
He wouldn't go to sleep without it.

1181
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:52,742
In a way, I guess, it's become
the voice of my conscience.

1182
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:55,578
He meant so much to my father.

1183
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:57,997
Everything was Steve.

1184
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:02,252
Talk of him going to college and
becoming a lawyer too.

1185
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:06,756
I was jealous of him,
I know that now.

1186
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:09,843
I used to pray to be
changed into a boy.

1187
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:11,886
Times I still do.

1188
01:22:12,387 --> 01:22:15,974
Climb trees, throw rocks, go fishing.

1189
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:19,018
Is that why you wear these clothes?

1190
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:21,312
Won't go to dances?

1191
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,232
Maybe.

1192
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,194
There's a dance tonight at the post.

1193
01:22:28,403 --> 01:22:30,780
Bachelor officer's hop.

1194
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:34,576
I'm a bachelor, you know?

1195
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:39,164
<i>Another thing
you ought to know is that...</i>

1196
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,291
How did you know?

1197
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,252
<i>Well, I...</i>

1198
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:47,505
I asked.

1199
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:53,011
Come here.

1200
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:58,892
Now, another thing you ought
to know about... Oh, excuse me.

1201
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:02,645
Another thing you ought to know
about me is I like the Army.

1202
01:23:02,812 --> 01:23:06,191
I just wouldn't be happy
anywhere else.

1203
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:10,195
Oh, I know the pay isn't much.

1204
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:13,198
Won't buy diamond earrings...

1205
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:16,826
...and fancy dresses, stuff like that.

1206
01:23:17,494 --> 01:23:20,705
And it can be a lonely life
for a woman.

1207
01:23:21,623 --> 01:23:24,417
But it can be a good life too.

1208
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:29,214
Are you proposing to me,
Lieutenant Gary?

1209
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:33,009
No! No, I was just asking you to go
to the dance with me tonight.

1210
01:23:33,218 --> 01:23:36,471
And as far as proposing,
I was gonna get around to that later.

1211
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:38,598
I'll call for you at 8, Marty.

1212
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:40,808
I haven't said I accept!

1213
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:44,521
I didn't promise you a thing,
Jim Gary!

1214
01:23:57,659 --> 01:23:59,327
Come in.

1215
01:23:59,577 --> 01:24:01,621
The prisoner,
present and accounted for.

1216
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,915
Good evening.
Care for a glass of sherry?

1217
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:06,543
- No, sir, I might take...
- That'll be all, sergeant.

1218
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:08,336
Yes, sir.

1219
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:16,219
No, I would not care
for a glass of sherry.

1220
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:20,932
I would care for a glass of whiskey,
a tall glass of whiskey.

1221
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,436
I've never liked you, Mr. McCabe.

1222
01:24:25,603 --> 01:24:27,772
Well, now you surprise me.

1223
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:30,483
However, I will concede...

1224
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:34,362
...that you have done me
and the Army a great service.

1225
01:24:34,696 --> 01:24:37,448
We can come to terms
with Quanah Parker...

1226
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:41,119
...but there was no reasoning
with hotheads like Stone Calf.

1227
01:24:41,286 --> 01:24:43,830
His death was most timely.

1228
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:47,876
Well, to your prompt return
to Tascosa.

1229
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,712
What's that mean?
I'm not under arrest?

1230
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:55,466
Here are your discharge papers,
Mr. McCabe.

1231
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:58,803
With some reluctance, I have
granted you an honourable discharge...

1232
01:24:59,012 --> 01:25:00,430
...and $40 for your services.

1233
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:03,433
- Well, you said it was $80 a month.
- Two weeks makes 40.

1234
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,102
I shelled out more than that
for the trade goods.

1235
01:25:06,269 --> 01:25:07,896
Yes, and for rifles.

1236
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:11,733
Too bad. Looks like you made
a bad investment.

1237
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:18,031
Well, here.

1238
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:24,120
- What was that for, sir?
- That's for the drink.

1239
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:30,960
Oh, you don't even store
honest whiskey.

1240
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,173
Guthrie.

1241
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,841
- She wants to speak...
- Guthrie?

1242
01:25:37,008 --> 01:25:39,928
- Will you go in, please?
- Yeah, that's my name.

1243
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:43,973
Why does she want to speak to him?

1244
01:25:44,182 --> 01:25:46,559
Oh, of all the stupid,
tactless people I've ever...

1245
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:49,687
- Well, I still want to know...
- Oh, shut up!

1246
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:52,732
Guthrie?

1247
01:25:57,654 --> 01:25:59,531
What is it now?

1248
01:26:01,908 --> 01:26:03,284
These people.

1249
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:08,289
They smile at me and show their teeth,
but it's the eyes that bite.

1250
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:12,669
I have not seen the back
of anyone's head since I came here.

1251
01:26:12,836 --> 01:26:18,424
Their eyes are all on my body
like dirty fingers.

1252
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:21,928
As if they would turn their backs,
I would leap upon them...

1253
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:25,682
...and my touch would have
to be washed off like filth.

1254
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:28,810
You should not have brought me here.

1255
01:26:29,269 --> 01:26:31,020
I do not belong with these people.

1256
01:26:31,187 --> 01:26:34,816
Running Wolf was brought in here
tied to a hand-led horse.

1257
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:36,401
You weren't, you know.

1258
01:26:36,568 --> 01:26:39,571
But how could I know
I would come back to this?

1259
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:44,617
For five years with the Comanches,
my eyes never saw a tear.

1260
01:26:44,784 --> 01:26:49,706
Now they see the silent questions.

1261
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:53,168
How many braves has she known?

1262
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:56,462
How many mestizo children
carry her blood in their veins?

1263
01:26:56,629 --> 01:27:00,758
Now, why didn't I kill myself?
I took a Comanche!

1264
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:04,762
<i>Well, that's great. That's...</i>

1265
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:08,933
That's great. You wanna go back, spend
the rest of your life as a Comanche?

1266
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,686
Hide behind that old war paint,
dead before you're 30.

1267
01:27:11,853 --> 01:27:12,979
I don't understand it.

1268
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:16,274
With all the Comanche
that's rubbed off on you, I don't know...

1269
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:18,484
Why didn't you soak up
a little backbone...

1270
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,320
...so you could stand up and fight?

1271
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:22,030
- Why didn't you do that?
- Fight?

1272
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:25,200
- Now, listen, you listen to me.
- How can I fight?

1273
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:28,870
Now, nobody wants their past
tattooed across their forehead.

1274
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:31,789
But you're gonna take those years
to the grave with you.

1275
01:27:31,956 --> 01:27:34,167
Sooner you learn to live
with them, the better.

1276
01:27:34,334 --> 01:27:36,586
Now, can't you understand that?

1277
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:42,258
You... You know, I prayed and prayed
that someone would come and help me.

1278
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:43,760
<i>And you. You...</i>

1279
01:27:43,968 --> 01:27:46,888
- Oh, now cut that out.
- I don't know how to show my gratitude.

1280
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:50,892
You hush. You hush.
Now, well... Stand up. Stand up.

1281
01:27:51,518 --> 01:27:53,728
<i>That darn thing. I...</i>

1282
01:27:53,895 --> 01:27:58,566
Now, just don't interrupt me.
I'm... I'm thinking.

1283
01:28:00,568 --> 01:28:03,822
Now, these people
are giving a dance tonight.

1284
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:05,365
Dance?

1285
01:28:05,532 --> 01:28:09,285
And you and me are gonna attend
that hoedown.

1286
01:28:09,494 --> 01:28:10,870
We're gonna, but...

1287
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:13,039
You're gonna have
to get yourself fixed up.

1288
01:28:13,206 --> 01:28:16,251
You gotta get a comb.
And you have to have a dress.

1289
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:18,419
Now, where am I gonna get a dress?

1290
01:28:18,628 --> 01:28:20,380
Jim Gary.

1291
01:28:20,588 --> 01:28:24,092
Jim Gary. He's engaged
to that little girl down at the settlers'.

1292
01:28:24,259 --> 01:28:26,803
He doesn't know it yet,
but he's engaged.

1293
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:29,305
She might have a dress.
She's about the same size.

1294
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:31,140
You turn around.
Well, never mind.

1295
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:32,976
Never mind. She might have a dress.

1296
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,478
And you've got to do something
about these.

1297
01:28:35,645 --> 01:28:41,609
<i>Either put them back,
or put them up like...</i>

1298
01:28:44,279 --> 01:28:47,699
Well, now, you get yourself fixed up,
I'll get the dress.

1299
01:29:42,128 --> 01:29:44,714
<i>So you are leaving...</i>

1300
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:47,967
When did you say you were leaving?

1301
01:29:49,052 --> 01:29:50,803
Sunup.

1302
01:29:53,932 --> 01:29:58,228
Independence,
that's a mighty long way.

1303
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:00,647
Yes, it is.

1304
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:03,066
<i>I...</i>

1305
01:30:03,233 --> 01:30:07,904
I've been thinking, I get a furlough
in about three months...

1306
01:30:08,822 --> 01:30:12,325
...do you think maybe I could come
and visit you?

1307
01:30:16,371 --> 01:30:20,875
Lieutenant Gary,
are you proposing now?

1308
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:24,546
<i>Yeah, I...</i>

1309
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:26,881
I guess I am.

1310
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:31,177
Well, aren't you...?

1311
01:30:32,804 --> 01:30:34,514
Don't you...?

1312
01:30:44,566 --> 01:30:46,067
Yeah.

1313
01:31:03,376 --> 01:31:05,628
Mama's gonna untie you.

1314
01:31:05,795 --> 01:31:08,673
I'm not going to leave you
tied up like that.

1315
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:26,524
Braid.

1316
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:32,322
Mama's gonna cut that off
so you'll be my darling little white boy.

1317
01:31:36,201 --> 01:31:38,411
Toby!

1318
01:31:49,506 --> 01:31:52,425
- Good evening.
- Evening, sir.

1319
01:31:57,555 --> 01:31:59,724
Come on, señorita.

1320
01:32:00,016 --> 01:32:02,602
Let's go in and knock them dead.

1321
01:32:10,276 --> 01:32:11,820
- Well, good evening.
- Hello, Jim.

1322
01:32:11,986 --> 01:32:13,863
Looking fit.

1323
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:17,200
Come on over here
and say hello to the major.

1324
01:32:19,953 --> 01:32:22,497
Major, you know
Señorita de la Madriaga.

1325
01:32:22,705 --> 01:32:24,082
- Major Frazer.
- Glad you could come.

1326
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:27,961
- And Mrs. Frazer.
- Very beautiful. Won't you sit down?

1327
01:32:28,169 --> 01:32:30,713
And you know Miss Purcell,
daughter of Judge Purcell.

1328
01:32:30,839 --> 01:32:34,092
- Of course. How are you, my dear?
- You know Marshal McCabe.

1329
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:37,804
Crusader of the law, diplomat,
adventurer, man-about...

1330
01:32:37,971 --> 01:32:41,474
Yes, thank you. Thank you.
Major, you have a very fine jail here.

1331
01:32:41,683 --> 01:32:43,726
I thought you'd appreciate it.

1332
01:32:43,893 --> 01:32:46,062
Well, you dance?

1333
01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:49,607
No, but I take an occasional drink.

1334
01:32:49,732 --> 01:32:52,026
Bar's right in there.

1335
01:33:12,839 --> 01:33:16,176
Can we get you ladies
some refreshments?

1336
01:33:17,677 --> 01:33:19,429
Marty?

1337
01:33:20,889 --> 01:33:22,307
Punch?

1338
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:25,059
Oh, yes.

1339
01:33:26,102 --> 01:33:29,939
- Well, excuse us.
- Yeah, we'll bring it right back.

1340
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:37,947
- Four, Posey.
- No, three.

1341
01:33:38,114 --> 01:33:40,700
- Enjoying the dance, marshal?
- No.

1342
01:33:45,914 --> 01:33:49,375
Well, looks like
we poisoned the waterhole.

1343
01:33:49,584 --> 01:33:51,294
Yeah.

1344
01:33:58,426 --> 01:34:02,347
Say, Upton, have you got a free dance
for Miss de la Madriaga?

1345
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:05,558
Sorry, Gary,
my program's all filled up.

1346
01:34:12,065 --> 01:34:15,193
Chase, how about you?
You got a free dance for the señorita?

1347
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,778
Well, sir, excuse me, but...

1348
01:34:16,986 --> 01:34:19,030
But this is our dance,
don't you remember?

1349
01:34:19,197 --> 01:34:22,742
Oh, wonderful. Excuse me, sir.

1350
01:34:50,061 --> 01:34:51,771
- Will you have some?
- No, thank you.

1351
01:34:51,938 --> 01:34:53,815
- Hey, that's a good idea.
- I thought so.

1352
01:34:53,982 --> 01:34:55,817
- Will you...?
- No, thanks.

1353
01:34:55,984 --> 01:34:58,611
- Major?
- No, thank you.

1354
01:34:58,903 --> 01:35:00,905
Would you care to dance, Marty?

1355
01:35:01,072 --> 01:35:02,740
Come on.

1356
01:35:02,949 --> 01:35:04,450
Come on.

1357
01:35:16,337 --> 01:35:20,633
Some of the ladies were inquiring...
Well, what they really wanna know is...

1358
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,721
...in this marriage to the Indian,
were there no children?

1359
01:35:25,305 --> 01:35:26,598
No, madam.

1360
01:35:26,764 --> 01:35:28,766
Oh, I see.

1361
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:45,116
My dear, we were wondering,
among the savages, is it true...?

1362
01:35:45,283 --> 01:35:46,659
Elena!

1363
01:35:57,128 --> 01:35:59,214
Now, you listen here.

1364
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:03,468
Now, you and me didn't get all
dressed up tonight for nothing.

1365
01:36:05,136 --> 01:36:07,096
Now, come on.

1366
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:16,773
You did that on purpose, Gary.
Don't you deny it.

1367
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:20,485
If you want satisfaction, Mr. Upton,
I'm at your disposal.

1368
01:36:20,652 --> 01:36:22,862
The same goes for you, Mr. Chase!

1369
01:36:23,029 --> 01:36:24,864
And that goes for all you gentlemen!

1370
01:36:25,073 --> 01:36:27,492
- Gary!
- Oh, please.

1371
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:30,537
I saw that, Mr. Gary.

1372
01:36:30,703 --> 01:36:33,206
You'll apologise to Mr. Upton
and this entire company.

1373
01:36:33,414 --> 01:36:35,959
I will not apologise, sir, respectfully.

1374
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:38,586
Major, please.

1375
01:36:39,128 --> 01:36:44,634
If there is any apology
to this assembly it is mine.

1376
01:36:44,801 --> 01:36:47,971
This is a military matter, Miss Madriaga,
nothing to do with you.

1377
01:36:48,096 --> 01:36:52,350
If I were not here tonight, major,
this would not have happened.

1378
01:36:52,475 --> 01:36:54,853
Am I allowed to speak?

1379
01:36:55,019 --> 01:36:58,314
Why, certainly. Yes.

1380
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:05,071
Ladies and gentlemen...

1381
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:10,410
...it seems like the only embarrassment
here tonight is my presence.

1382
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:13,746
If the truth will quiet
your unspoken questions...

1383
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:15,373
...I give it gladly.

1384
01:37:16,124 --> 01:37:20,295
For five years I was the woman
of the Comanche, Stone Calf.

1385
01:37:21,546 --> 01:37:23,590
He treated me like a wife.

1386
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:28,094
The work was hard,
the scoldings frequent...

1387
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:31,806
...and occasionally he beat me.

1388
01:37:33,057 --> 01:37:36,019
I did not bear him any children.

1389
01:37:37,061 --> 01:37:40,815
I know that many of you regard me
as a degraded woman.

1390
01:37:41,733 --> 01:37:44,486
Degraded by the touch
of a savage Comanche...

1391
01:37:44,611 --> 01:37:47,447
...by having had to live
as one of them.

1392
01:37:47,614 --> 01:37:52,285
You said I... Why did I not kill myself?

1393
01:37:52,452 --> 01:37:54,037
Why I did not...?

1394
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,831
- Why, I...?
- Go on. Go on, you're doing fine.

1395
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:00,919
- I can't!
- Well, I sure as hell can.

1396
01:38:01,419 --> 01:38:05,632
She didn't kill herself
because her religion forbids it.

1397
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:10,512
You know, sometimes it takes more
courage to live than it does to die.

1398
01:38:10,678 --> 01:38:13,223
You'd agree with that,
wouldn't you, major?

1399
01:38:13,389 --> 01:38:16,017
You know, I don't think
any of you folks in this room...

1400
01:38:16,184 --> 01:38:18,019
...have ever been
to a Comanche camp.

1401
01:38:18,186 --> 01:38:20,230
Have you, major?

1402
01:38:20,813 --> 01:38:22,440
<i>- Well...
- No. No.</i>

1403
01:38:22,607 --> 01:38:26,486
I have. I usually limit my visits
to three days.

1404
01:38:26,653 --> 01:38:29,197
Three days.
That's about 45 working hours...

1405
01:38:29,364 --> 01:38:31,199
...for a woman in one of those camps.

1406
01:38:31,324 --> 01:38:34,702
You know, a Comanche, he don't know
when Sunday comes.

1407
01:38:34,869 --> 01:38:39,040
<i>And cooking's sort of the recreation
for the women, they...</i>

1408
01:38:39,207 --> 01:38:42,836
And then, in their spare time, they
chew the glue out of buffalo hides...

1409
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:45,839
...so that their man can have
a nice soft pair of moccasins.

1410
01:38:46,005 --> 01:38:48,466
You can judge for yourself
what kind of life it is...

1411
01:38:48,633 --> 01:38:50,802
...by the number of survivors
we brought back.

1412
01:38:51,010 --> 01:38:54,264
- That's right, McCabe only...
- Yeah, but you shut up. You shut up.

1413
01:38:55,098 --> 01:38:56,933
And now some of you are asking...

1414
01:38:57,141 --> 01:38:58,977
...why this young lady
doesn't go back.

1415
01:38:59,185 --> 01:39:01,604
Well, it might be interesting
for you to know...

1416
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:05,483
...that this afternoon
she asked me to take her back.

1417
01:39:06,651 --> 01:39:09,279
Because she was treated much better
by the Comanches...

1418
01:39:09,445 --> 01:39:12,365
...than she's been treated
by some of you.

1419
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:17,120
Good going.

1420
01:39:18,872 --> 01:39:20,957
Permission to leave, sir.

1421
01:39:21,124 --> 01:39:24,919
Mrs. Frazer, it was a grand party.

1422
01:39:49,402 --> 01:39:50,778
Hold everything here!

1423
01:39:50,987 --> 01:39:52,780
Hold it! Hold it! What is this?

1424
01:39:52,947 --> 01:39:54,824
Cold-blooded murder,
that's what it is.

1425
01:39:55,033 --> 01:39:57,160
And in my opinion,
you're as much to blame...

1426
01:39:57,327 --> 01:39:59,704
...as that mad dog you brought in.

1427
01:40:00,371 --> 01:40:02,499
Come on!

1428
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:07,837
No, Mr. Wringle, don't blame him.
It was my fault, all of it.

1429
01:40:08,004 --> 01:40:09,422
God pity me.

1430
01:40:09,589 --> 01:40:12,509
- Oh, no, not Mrs. McCandless?
- Yes, Martha.

1431
01:40:12,675 --> 01:40:15,094
She cut him loose
so he could eat his food.

1432
01:40:15,261 --> 01:40:18,598
He grabbed the knife
and stabbed her through the heart.

1433
01:40:19,265 --> 01:40:23,269
Now, look!
Look, I know how you men feel...

1434
01:40:23,478 --> 01:40:25,647
...but there's not going to be
any lynching.

1435
01:40:25,813 --> 01:40:27,440
You think you're going to stop it?

1436
01:40:27,649 --> 01:40:28,942
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Yes, I am.

1437
01:40:29,108 --> 01:40:30,485
Ortho. Greely.

1438
01:40:30,693 --> 01:40:34,572
Now, this here no lynching be,
soldier boy.

1439
01:40:34,781 --> 01:40:38,868
The boy's had a fair trial
with a judge and a jury.

1440
01:40:39,035 --> 01:40:41,246
I can imagine the kind
of a defence he had.

1441
01:40:41,412 --> 01:40:44,374
Lieutenant Gary!
I defended him as best I could.

1442
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:47,877
- Yes, he did.
- But the jury decided different.

1443
01:40:48,086 --> 01:40:52,298
And I, as presiding judge,
pronounced the sentence.

1444
01:40:52,465 --> 01:40:55,927
He's to be hanged by the neck
until he's dead.

1445
01:40:56,094 --> 01:40:57,929
Now, wait a minute!

1446
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:04,686
All right, bring him out to the tree.

1447
01:41:15,113 --> 01:41:17,907
Hey! Hey!

1448
01:41:18,658 --> 01:41:21,286
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1449
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:24,205
Mine! Mine!

1450
01:41:24,372 --> 01:41:26,040
Mine!

1451
01:41:26,207 --> 01:41:29,169
Mine! Mine!

1452
01:41:29,335 --> 01:41:31,963
All right, get him up here
on the wagon.

1453
01:41:33,256 --> 01:41:36,426
No! No! No!

1454
01:41:36,593 --> 01:41:38,678
No!

1455
01:42:05,997 --> 01:42:08,291
McCandless!

1456
01:43:02,929 --> 01:43:04,389
Good morning, señor.

1457
01:43:27,745 --> 01:43:29,455
Hi there, Mr. McCabe!

1458
01:43:29,706 --> 01:43:32,125
Welcome home.

1459
01:43:38,715 --> 01:43:41,593
Ward, you're sitting in my chair.

1460
01:43:42,635 --> 01:43:44,304
<i>You...</i>

1461
01:43:45,346 --> 01:43:47,932
Those clothes look familiar to you?

1462
01:43:48,183 --> 01:43:50,435
- Yep.
- You got my clothes on?

1463
01:43:50,935 --> 01:43:52,812
No, sir, Mr. McCabe.

1464
01:43:52,979 --> 01:43:55,356
These ain't your clothes.

1465
01:43:55,523 --> 01:43:59,611
Belle, my fiancée,
Mrs. Aragon, that is...

1466
01:43:59,944 --> 01:44:03,948
...she sent off to San Antone for them.
Same place that you get yours.

1467
01:44:04,574 --> 01:44:08,119
I ain't wearing a single thing
belongs to you.

1468
01:44:08,411 --> 01:44:10,330
Excepting this star.

1469
01:44:11,122 --> 01:44:13,374
And that ain't yours no more.

1470
01:44:13,541 --> 01:44:15,710
Not since we had the election
last week.

1471
01:44:16,377 --> 01:44:19,088
I bet you can't guess
who's the new marshal.

1472
01:44:19,255 --> 01:44:20,882
Oh, don't tell me. Don't tell me.

1473
01:44:21,049 --> 01:44:23,009
Don't tell... Let me think this out.

1474
01:44:23,176 --> 01:44:25,762
Let me think. And you hush, Jim.
You hush.

1475
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:29,641
- No, I have... Nothing.
- Not a word. Not a word.

1476
01:44:31,226 --> 01:44:34,771
I didn't get to vote for myself,
not even once.

1477
01:44:35,772 --> 01:44:38,733
Say, you fellas
sure look hot and thirsty.

1478
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:42,529
How'd you like to have
a nice cold beer?

1479
01:44:42,695 --> 01:44:44,823
Honeybee.

1480
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,118
Honeybee?

1481
01:44:49,327 --> 01:44:52,288
Sounded like "honeybee."

1482
01:44:52,747 --> 01:44:54,582
Honeybee.

1483
01:44:58,086 --> 01:44:59,796
Thank you.

1484
01:45:06,261 --> 01:45:08,388
<i>Ma'am, I wouldn't go...</i>

1485
01:45:23,236 --> 01:45:24,946
- You said the room was...
- The room.

1486
01:45:25,113 --> 01:45:27,782
- But not here. We'll...
- What's your rush?

1487
01:45:27,949 --> 01:45:30,994
- You haven't introduced the lady to me.
- And I don't intend to.

1488
01:45:31,161 --> 01:45:32,495
Really?

1489
01:45:32,662 --> 01:45:34,455
Then I'll introduce myself.

1490
01:45:34,998 --> 01:45:36,875
Belle Aragon.

1491
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:40,253
And everything you see around here
belongs to me.

1492
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:42,172
Including the livestock.

1493
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:48,845
You are to be congratulated, madam.

1494
01:45:49,429 --> 01:45:51,806
"Miss," if you don't mind.

1495
01:45:51,973 --> 01:45:53,808
And you can drop the phoney airs.

1496
01:45:54,559 --> 01:45:58,646
I know all about you, Mrs. Stone Calf.

1497
01:45:58,855 --> 01:46:01,941
News travels fast in this country.

1498
01:46:02,484 --> 01:46:04,068
How'd you like a job, honey?

1499
01:46:05,278 --> 01:46:07,614
I could put your hair
in Indian braids.

1500
01:46:07,822 --> 01:46:12,160
A short skirt, some squaw boots,
a little bear grease.

1501
01:46:12,327 --> 01:46:13,912
You'd be quite an attraction.

1502
01:46:21,377 --> 01:46:24,839
- Does that stagecoach go to California?
- Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

1503
01:46:25,048 --> 01:46:28,885
That coach goes to El Paso.
You can change coaches there.

1504
01:46:29,052 --> 01:46:31,054
But you ain't going to California.

1505
01:46:31,221 --> 01:46:33,348
Yes, I am.

1506
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:37,101
Thank you very much
for being so kind.

1507
01:46:45,151 --> 01:46:47,445
Belle, I'm gonna beat hell
out of you!

1508
01:46:47,612 --> 01:46:48,905
Honeybee!

1509
01:46:52,325 --> 01:46:55,829
- You thought I was fooling.
- No, no.

1510
01:46:59,415 --> 01:47:01,626
Please, do you have room for me?

1511
01:47:01,835 --> 01:47:05,505
Proud to haul you, ma'am,
proud to haul you. Step right in.

1512
01:47:06,548 --> 01:47:08,508
Ward.

1513
01:47:08,758 --> 01:47:10,343
Thanks for the beer. Jim.

1514
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:13,429
And six months room rent.
And meals.

1515
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:18,268
And six months room rent.
And meals.

1516
01:47:18,434 --> 01:47:20,436
<i>And...</i>

1517
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,023
Jim.

1518
01:47:25,358 --> 01:47:27,443
Jim, take care of the Army.
They need you.

1519
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:30,446
- So long. Good luck.
- So long.

1520
01:47:30,613 --> 01:47:32,866
So long, Belle!

1521
01:47:34,242 --> 01:47:36,202
- Hey, Slim.
- Yes, marshal?

1522
01:47:36,411 --> 01:47:38,580
- Come here a minute.
- Stand by, Chuck!

1523
01:47:38,746 --> 01:47:41,791
Come on! Come on, fellas!
We're late.

1524
01:47:59,559 --> 01:48:01,227
Hang on, señorita.

1525
01:48:01,394 --> 01:48:03,855
Here we go!

1526
01:48:06,608 --> 01:48:09,569
So long, Jim!

1527
01:48:12,489 --> 01:48:14,782
So long, Guth!

1528
01:48:19,496 --> 01:48:24,042
You'd think a woman
with my experience...

1529
01:48:25,126 --> 01:48:27,545
...would know more about men.

1530
01:48:27,712 --> 01:48:29,547
Yeah.

1531
01:48:30,632 --> 01:48:32,926
Well, guess old Guth
finally found something...

1532
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:35,011
...he wanted more than 10 percent of.
