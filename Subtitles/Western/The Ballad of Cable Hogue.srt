1
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,831
Sorry, old-timer...

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,231
...but you're only part poison,
and I'm hungry for meat.

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,670
Getting a little thirsty too.

4
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,152
Taggart?

5
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,673
Bowen, go easy.

6
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,312
You peckerwoods just raised hell
with our supper.

7
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,356
Find any water?

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,234
I appreciate humor, boys...

9
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,756
...but I'm beginning to think
you're cutting it a mite thin.

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,672
What else we got to do?

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,391
What did you find?

12
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,269
Ten thousand gallons of sand,
that's what we found.

13
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,988
We had you shaking, didn't we, Cable?

14
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,272
Hold him, boy. Get over there.

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,956
It's just like you said, Hogue.

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,078
There's water enough for two,
but not for three.

17
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,437
You damn fool. You had us.

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,830
You just wouldn't pull the trigger.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,676
- Because you're yellow.
- Yeah, he's yellow. Just plain yellow.

20
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,196
- Hell, you're yellow, Hogue.
- Cable is yellow.

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,635
<i>Old Cable's yellow</i>

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,837
<i>Old Cable is white</i>
<i>Old Cable's dying</i>

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,319
<i>But that's all right</i>

24
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,831
<i>Taggart and Bowen as slick as you please</i>
<i>Took all the water and left for the trees</i>

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,231
Hey, fellas. Leave me a little.

26
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,073
- Please.
- It's all yours, Cable.

27
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,439
Fifty thousand gallons of sand.

28
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,078
- We've got your water, Cable.
- Yellow!

29
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,356
Call me yellow.

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,079
Leave me to dry and blow away.

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,075
Sing a song about it!

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,909
Laugh at old Cable Hogue, huh?

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,555
I'll get out! I'll get out!

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,280
Don't you worry none about that!

35
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,358
You just...

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,115
...worry about when I get out.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,350
I'll find you, Taggart.

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,557
You, Bowen,
you mealy-mouthed little pimp.

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,555
You never could tell gold-shine from
lizard shit, and there's a big difference.

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,836
A big difference!

41
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,113
I'll live to spit on your graves!

42
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,835
<i>Old Cable's yellow</i>

43
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,828
Yellow!

44
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,793
We got your water.

45
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,432
Ain't had no water
since yesterday, Lord.

46
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,111
Getting a little thirsty.

47
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,390
Just thought I'd mention it. Amen.

48
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,117
Yesterday, I told you I was thirsty...

49
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,193
...and I thought you might
turn up some water.

50
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,151
Now, if I sinned,
you just send me a drop or two...

51
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,436
...and I won't do it no more...

52
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,955
...whatever in the hell it was I did.

53
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,711
I mean that, Lord.

54
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,030
Four days without water. You don't
think I've put in my suffering time...

55
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,793
...you ought to try going dry for a spell.

56
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,713
Listen to me. Listen to me.

57
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,670
If I don't get some soon,
I ain't gonna have no chance to repent.

58
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,476
Careful, now.
You're about to get my dander up.

59
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,433
Lord...

60
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,276
...you call it.

61
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,679
I'm just plain done in.

62
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,231
Amen.

63
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,671
Hogue...

64
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,037
...found it.

65
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,235
Told you I was gonna live.

66
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,071
This is Cable Hogue talking.
Hogue. Me.

67
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,835
Cable Hogue. Hogue. Me.

68
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,754
Me. I did it. Cable Hogue.

69
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,957
I found it. Me.

70
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,278
Wagons.

71
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,232
Stagecoaches.

72
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,834
Buckboards.

73
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,395
With kids and mamas.

74
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,273
People.

75
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,150
Going somewhere on a road.

76
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,151
And I'm on it.

77
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,514
Me and my water hole.

78
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,151
I whipped them bastards.

79
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,110
Now all I gotta do is wait.

80
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,873
Get out of there, boy.

81
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,918
Get with it. Hop on.

82
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,276
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.

83
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,873
Please.

84
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,470
Is something the matter?
Why are we stopping? Are we in trouble?

85
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,868
He is, we ain't.

86
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,838
- Nice evening, fellas.
- You're a long way from home.

87
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,670
- I'm halfway to hell and looking for help.
- You got it, pilgrim.

88
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,719
You've fallen among good hands.
The Gospel says: Do unto others...

89
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,553
- You want a ride in?
- He can ride inside with us.

90
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,912
- Matthew, chapter 2, verse 3.
- Daniel, are you sure?

91
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,514
I've told you never
to question my judgment.

92
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,399
As I hear, I judge,
and my judgment is just.

93
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,996
- John, chapter 5, verse 30.
- I've never questioned your judgment.

94
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,630
In the 26 years of our marriage,
blessed by a devotion to the Lord...

95
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,076
...I have never questioned
your judgment. But I am now.

96
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,791
It seems ridiculous to sit in the middle
of the desert, watching men drink.

97
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,075
We're near halfway in.

98
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,034
- How about $3?
- Nope.

99
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,316
If sugar were 2 cents a barrel...

100
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,075
...I couldn't afford a pinch of salt
or an egg to put it on.

101
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,798
- I was robbed about five days back.
- Robbed? Robbed?

102
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,554
- Robbery, did you say?
- They nailed me on the flats.

103
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,595
- They took everything I had.
- Mister, you're damn lucky to be alive.

104
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,513
Your language is disgusting.
Both of you.

105
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,999
Hell, we know that.

106
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,754
Well! More profanity.

107
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,356
Shoot, partner, crawl on up.
You can ride for nothing.

108
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,592
- What do you expect me to do?
- I expect you to take action.

109
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,479
We should leave.
Will you please instruct the driver?

110
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,279
- No, thanks.
- Driver, it's getting late.

111
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,271
Don't fret, Your Honor.

112
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,953
We're just fixing to leave
as soon as I count my money.

113
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,989
- Count your what?
- Soon as I water my mule.

114
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,229
Watering his mule?
What on earth does he mean?

115
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,358
- I'll explain it to you later.
- How far is it to town?

116
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,399
- Oh, Deaddog's...
- Twenty miles.

117
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,835
- And Gila City is about...
- Same old 20 miles.

118
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,231
- I don't see any mules.
- Looks like you could use another stop.

119
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,992
Wouldn't be no good without water.

120
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,833
This stage appears to me
to be driven by horses.

121
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,399
Please.

122
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,994
No water between Gila and Deaddog?

123
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,513
Nope.

124
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,080
Sure don't seem to bother me none.

125
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,558
Daniel, are you going
to do something or am I?

126
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,518
Be worth a lot if a fella was to find it?

127
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,671
Worth a damn sight more than gold.

128
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,233
- Driver, it's getting dark.
- Generally does about this time.

129
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,154
- Damnedest thing I ever saw.
- Get him to start this vehicle.

130
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,515
Got enough water to hold you?

131
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,114
- Never, anywhere.
- Just... Daniel.

132
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,829
- Yep.
- I demand you start this vehicle at once.

133
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,599
Fellas?

134
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,995
Sure do... Well, many thanks.

135
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,594
- Many thanks till you're better paid.
- Start this vehicle.

136
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,991
I am going to report you
to your superiors.

137
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,068
You shall never drive again,
do you hear?

138
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,471
The wrath of God cometh
on the children of disobedience.

139
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,110
- Ephesians, chapter 5, verse 6.
- Amen.

140
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,715
Hallelujah, brother! The Lord
giveth and the Lord taketh away.

141
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,077
- Matthew, chapter 2...
- When are you coming back?

142
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,676
Next week. You sure
you don't wanna ride with us?

143
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,718
No.

144
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,798
No.

145
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,191
I'll be right here, Hogue.

146
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,438
Right here.

147
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,397
Hey, feller.

148
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,718
Hey, hold up there a minute, feller.

149
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,316
That's 10 cents. That's my water.
My land, my water.

150
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,590
- Found it where it wasn't. Ten cents.
- Here's your pay.

151
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,994
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Is that so?

152
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,831
- Give me that rifle.
- I'll give you what's in it.

153
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,278
Now get out.

154
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,269
Drop by again.
Always open for business.

155
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,873
You're my first customer.

156
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,238
Appears to me you've been
17 kinds of a damn fool.

157
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,080
Not that it seems to bother you none.

158
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,393
Peace and goodwill, brother.
I come as a friend.

159
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,553
- Careful, son, I'm a man of God.
- Well, you damn near joined him.

160
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,200
- Anybody with you?
- I'm alone.

161
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,675
I am the Reverend
Joshua Duncan Sloane...

162
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,719
...preacher to all of eastern Nevada
and selected parts of northern Arizona.

163
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,075
Well, you're a sorry preacher.

164
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,394
And a hell of a sneak.

165
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,155
In my case, sir, those thus attributed
often go hand in hand.

166
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,029
And speaking of such,
here is mine in all good fellowship.

167
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,551
I'm Cable Hogue.

168
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,156
Cable? That's rather
an unusual name, isn't it?

169
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,400
You have builded an oasis
out of this wilderness.

170
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,951
Oh, no, I just stumbled on that mud hole
over there and I dug it out a little.

171
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,790
You might call this place
Cable Springs. Sound good?

172
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,593
Yeah.

173
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,638
That excavation, a wine cellar perhaps?

174
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,475
No, that's a three-holer.
Expecting a lot of business.

175
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,676
I see tragedy has already struck
this cactus Eden.

176
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,558
No, that's no tragedy.

177
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,030
Shot the son of a bitch.
With his own rifle. He tried to kill me.

178
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,749
He was my first customer.
You're my second.

179
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,755
Well said and well done. Defend thyself
with the jawbone of an ass if need be.

180
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,990
You're a Good Samaritan to offer help...

181
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,709
...to a needy traveler...
- Hallelujah, brother. At 10 cents a head.

182
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,718
Water to men, sheep and hogs, 10
cents. Horses, mules and cows, 2 bits.

183
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,956
- Of course.
- In advance.

184
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,031
- In advance.
- In advance.

185
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,715
Which means before you drink,
you pay 10 cents. In advance.

186
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,236
Cast thy bread upon the waters,
let this man have his just needs.

187
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,030
You talk like a man of God, all right. But
I worked like hell for that there water.

188
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,715
My poor, misguided friend,
you are a sinner in need of redemption.

189
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,074
I will redeem you.

190
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,630
Ten cents, you pious bastard,
or I'll bury you.

191
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,477
What church did you say you was with?

192
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,270
The Church of the Wayfaring Stranger.
A church of my own revelation.

193
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,438
Just like that?

194
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,389
- Just like that.
- Where's it located?

195
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,199
Wherever I go, it goes with me.

196
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,159
Would you like to see some
of my parishioners? Sisters of the spirit.

197
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,635
Why, that one's naked
as a jaybird's ass.

198
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,395
Naked we come into this earth,
naked we shall return.

199
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,951
Well, well, brother Hogue.

200
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,710
I foresee a great community
springing out of the sand.

201
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,429
Busy thoroughfares, alabaster buildings...

202
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,114
...a thriving community
filled with the faithful.

203
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,397
- Amen.
- How much of this land is yours?

204
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,718
To sell, of course. I wish to buy.

205
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,878
Well, considerable.

206
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,679
I didn't see any boundary stakes
anywhere.

207
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,470
I suppose you've been too busy to go
into the land office and file your claim.

208
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,191
You know, if anyone were to drop
a word of this in Deaddog or Lizard...

209
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,318
...there would be 47 men
riding out here by sundown...

210
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,358
...with a claim in one hand
and a gun in the other.

211
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,557
Yes, this information could mean
quite a lot of money...

212
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,990
What a blessing religion must be,
preacher. It touches my heart.

213
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,957
The loan of your horse.

214
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,237
It's nothing, my friend.
Ride in good health with my blessing.

215
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,391
I hate to go in among them...

216
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,754
...but you've shown me the way
to salvation and a secured claim.

217
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,710
My only aim in life is to help
the misbegotten, the downtrodden...

218
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,429
...and the members of my parish.

219
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,670
God bless you, preacher.

220
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,637
Make yourself to home.

221
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,713
Only don't forget, every time you take
a drink, leave 10 cents in the cup...

222
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,110
...or I'll blow your ass
into next Wednesday.

223
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,838
Come on, get up there. Get up there.

224
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,593
Well, get in...

225
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,877
...get it over with...

226
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,837
...then get out.

227
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,078
Please, miss.

228
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,038
Yes?

229
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,353
Please...

230
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,356
Well, hell, could you tell me
where the land office is?

231
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,435
Well, you're looking right at it.

232
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,115
Can't you see the sign?

233
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,268
Well, you see, miss, I...

234
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,198
Well, hell, I don't read too goddamn
good. My name's Cable Hogue.

235
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,192
Which one is it?

236
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,034
It's right there, with the white sign.

237
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,875
Thank you kindly, miss.

238
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,995
The stage office?

239
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,113
It's kitty-corner from here,
across from the bank.

240
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,158
- Thank you, miss.
- My pleasure.

241
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,038
Thank you truly.

242
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,512
How much it cost to file?

243
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,353
Will this be under the Desert Land Act
or homesteaded?

244
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,318
Well, I wanna do what's right.

245
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,155
Under the Desert Land Act, an individual
can file for up to 320 acres...

246
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,629
...at a dollar and a quarter an acre.

247
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,472
Plus proof of reclamation.

248
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,949
Now, whoa. Hold up there, fella.

249
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,918
What the hell does all that mean?

250
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,516
Land without water is not allowable.

251
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,319
If you can't substantiate
either agricultural...

252
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,789
Hold on there, fella. I got water.

253
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,313
Water?

254
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,196
- Where?
- West.

255
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,592
Eight miles through that Red Rock pass.
Off by the wagon road there.

256
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,912
- Seems to be open at present, but...
- But my ass.

257
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,395
- There's no water there.
- Yeah? Come on out.

258
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,028
If you can't drink it,
I'll fry that claim paper.

259
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,872
Speaking of which, where is it?

260
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,270
All right. What's your name?

261
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,318
Cable Hogue.

262
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,153
C-A-B... L-E or E-L?

263
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,717
How do you spell Cable?

264
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,676
If you're bogging down on Cable,
wait till you get to Hogue.

265
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,389
- How much it gonna cost?
- Dollar and a quarter an acre.

266
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,393
Here.

267
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,078
What will that buy me?

268
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,029
- That will buy you two acres.
- Hang it in, then.

269
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,431
Let's see what it'll do,
as the lady said to the sailor.

270
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,752
- Two acres, Mr. Hogue?
- It's legal, ain't it?

271
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,197
- Well, yeah.
- Mark it.

272
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,999
Two acres at Cable Springs,
signed, sealed and delivered!

273
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,312
- You put her down right there.
- Yes, sir.

274
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,109
- I want a copy on my desk.
- Right away, sir.

275
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,751
You the boss here?

276
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,112
- I'm Quittner.
- Quittner?

277
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,236
Well, I'll bet you ain't
no quitter, are you?

278
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,350
So you bought yourself a claim
for two dollars and a half.

279
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,395
- So what?
- So it was every last cent I had.

280
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,671
I can believe it.

281
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,071
Where is this claim, Mr...?

282
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,708
- Mr...?
- Hogue.

283
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,950
C-A-B-L-E.

284
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,476
- It's at Jackass Flats, about a mile...
- What you got out there...

285
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,393
...is so important
you gotta bother me with it?

286
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,111
You trying to tell me you found water
between here and Gila?

287
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,757
If you was to give me $35...

288
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,435
...I'd cut you in for half.

289
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,636
This stage line's been operating
for 35 years.

290
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,951
We've looked under every rock
between here and Gila.

291
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,272
If there was water in that 40 miles,
we'd have found it.

292
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,116
- I'm telling you straight!
- No, I'm telling you straight!

293
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,478
I've had my belly full of broken-down
prospectors, hoboes...

294
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,835
...and get-rich-quick-on-my-money
promoters.

295
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,750
Every one of you comes by here
is trying to gouge money out of me.

296
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,118
You're the only son of a bitch that has
the gall to pour water on my britches.

297
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,273
Now, I let you talk, I listened to you
and I'm not interested.

298
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,476
Get out and stay out, partner.

299
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,318
- By God, this is worth something.
- Yeah, worth two acres of Jackass Flats.

300
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,798
- Eleven hundred.
- Twelve.

301
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,393
Thirteen fifty.

302
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,597
- Forty, 45.
- That's 1500.

303
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,158
One thousand one, two...

304
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,233
- Ninety-two hundred.
...three, four...

305
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,119
...five, six...
- Twenty-five, thirty...

306
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,558
- Something I can do for you?
- That chunk of paper there?

307
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,553
That's me. Mine. Mine.

308
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,396
Across the street there, they think
I'm lying. They say there's no water.

309
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,232
No water?

310
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,833
Listen.

311
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,151
I was robbed and left to die
without a drop.

312
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,275
Well, do I look dead?

313
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,230
No, sir. Climbed up on my hind feet
and walked straight to water.

314
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,072
W-A-T-L-E.

315
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,349
That grabs you by the short hairs,
don't it?

316
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,637
- You've got the floor.
- Those silly jackasses over there...

317
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,872
...can laugh at me all they want,
but they're in trouble.

318
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,474
Wouldn't you think
a stage line could see that?

319
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,599
In all the long, wrought-out,
back-breaking, kidney-shaking...

320
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,149
...bladder-busting
miles from here to Lizard...

321
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,198
...there's not one spot
of wet relief for man nor beast.

322
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,753
Now, if I could bring comfort to
the passengers, rest to the teams...

323
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,639
...food and drink to the drivers,
and water to all...

324
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,918
...what would be wrong with that? A
preacher out at my diggings will tell you.

325
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,799
- Would you doubt a man of the Gospel?
- Of course.

326
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,791
That's the first man I'd doubt.

327
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,274
By golly.

328
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,318
I'll be damned.

329
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,789
Looks like I came to the right place
after all.

330
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,516
What do you want?

331
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,316
Grubstake.

332
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,198
Thirty-five of them green ones.

333
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,510
Have you any collateral?

334
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,071
Do you own anything?

335
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,998
- Why, sure. I told you, there.
- That is $2 and a half.

336
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,068
Well, I'm worth something, ain't I?

337
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,990
I want to hear more.

338
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,349
- Why?
- Why not?

339
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,278
Hey, I always thought you bankers
stole for the rich.

340
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,989
- I didn't know you'd talk to trash like me.
- We don't steal.

341
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,795
Well, lend, borrow, invest
and mortgage and repossess.

342
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,349
What the hell else do you call it?

343
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,590
What's your name?

344
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,913
Cable Hogue.

345
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,150
Cable, with an L-E.

346
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,392
So, Mr. Cable Hogue...

347
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,599
...is $35 all you want?

348
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,508
Will a hundred get you started?

349
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,472
Hey, Hildy, you got a new customer.

350
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,356
Go on in, mister.

351
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,114
She's just waiting for you.
Go on in.

352
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,917
Standing like a jackass eating cactus.

353
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,989
Yes?

354
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,360
Hello.

355
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,229
Did you want to see me?

356
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,350
Well, come on in.

357
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,189
Honey, you was smelling bad enough
to gag a dog off a gut wagon.

358
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,430
I smell a lot better right now though.

359
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,035
Hey, look at that. Inside plumbing.

360
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,677
As good as anything you'll find
in Kansas City.

361
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,759
Sweet glory, love.

362
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,998
Well, I had to get you rinsed off,
didn't I?

363
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,471
I swear I never seen a man so dirty.

364
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,871
You know, you must have had
a pound of dirt on you.

365
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,920
Well, feel a lot lighter now, Millie.

366
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,270
My name is Hildy.

367
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,791
Well.

368
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,349
Now, don't you be mixing me up
with them other ones.

369
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,117
Don't worry. I won't.

370
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,231
You know, honey...

371
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,840
...if you're ever thinking
of quitting this job...

372
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,560
...I'm building myself a place.

373
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,557
It's gonna be something.

374
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,358
No.

375
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,078
I've had enough of this damn desert.

376
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,152
Not me. Not yet.

377
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,036
I'm on my way up.

378
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,719
Undo me.

379
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,519
San Francisco is my next stop.

380
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,398
San Francisco?

381
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,917
- And when I hit Frisco...
- Noisy, god-awful, claptrap town.

382
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,959
...I'm gonna hit it in style.

383
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,954
- Two days and you're tired of it.
- Tired of it?

384
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,073
I ain't even got there yet.

385
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,513
Oh, you'll get there, all right.

386
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,148
You bet your sweet life I will.

387
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,831
One way or another, love.

388
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,359
And when I do hit Frisco...

389
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,035
...I'm gonna be the ladiest damn lady
you ever seen.

390
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,757
I'm gonna marry me the richest man
in San Francisco.

391
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,234
Maybe the two richest men.
It's just a question of time.

392
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,631
Well, if you ever need any help...

393
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,115
- You remember my name?
- You remember mine?

394
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,149
Come here.

395
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,153
God's pure and natural elements
are being threatened by the devil, yes.

396
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,597
Sinners.

397
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,876
What's wrong?

398
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,197
The devil seeks to destroy you
with machines!

399
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,108
Ask me how I know.

400
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,434
There are those of us who talk to God.
God talked to me the other day.

401
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,756
He said:

402
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,917
"Inventions are the work of Satan.

403
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,352
Tell them how it is, James."

404
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,953
I gotta go. That pious son of a bitch
could have sold me out.

405
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,999
- What?
- Taking the stage to Gila. Sold me out.

406
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,071
Hogue.

407
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,675
Hogue.

408
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,351
- Come here.
- "Turn your backs.

409
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,990
And gather by the river
with me, James."

410
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,434
That's what the Almighty said.

411
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,268
Lost it. No good.

412
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,673
Trouble is, I... I forgot
to mark my boundaries.

413
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,993
Build me a claim monument.

414
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,039
- What in the hell are you talking about?
- Just know it.

415
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,316
- Bother me.
- Bother you?

416
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,990
All the way through it.

417
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,590
Keep thinking of that damn preacher
out there.

418
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,558
- Maybe come here to cheat me.
- Hogue.

419
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,439
Hell of a time to hold a goddamn
prayer meeting!

420
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,512
What is the matter with you?

421
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,157
Hey!

422
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,548
What?

423
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,473
- Ain't you forgetting something?
- What?

424
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,152
Well, what about me?

425
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,949
- Me. Me and my money.
- Money?

426
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,109
For what?

427
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,875
Well, if you don't want me here.

428
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,473
Easy. Easy.

429
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,191
Whoa, hold up there, now. Careful.

430
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,797
- Didn't take you long, mister.
- Just a damn minute.

431
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,238
Hildy, listen to me. I told you.
He's gonna take the stage to Gila.

432
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,391
Sold me out.

433
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,276
- I'll be back.
- Back, hell. You'll pay me now!

434
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,076
Look at him go!
Where's he going?

435
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,550
Attagirl, Hildy.

436
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,914
- There you are, you son of a bitch.
- I told you I'd be back.

437
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,152
- You call yourself a man?
- Well, of course I do.

438
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,630
- I got business at the springs.
- You got business with me.

439
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,031
Now, get up here and settle up.

440
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,997
- Later, Hildy.
- Later, hell!

441
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,235
Well, you know how it is, folks. Women.

442
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,715
Just a damn minute, Cable!

443
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,873
- Peace. Everything will be all right.
- Take your hands off of me.

444
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,271
- Not you. You!
- Will you get off my face?

445
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,159
Is that you, Robert?
What are you doing?

446
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,154
Get ahold of him, Frank.
He's getting away.

447
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,231
Get him! Get him!

448
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,114
Go get him, Frank!

449
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,628
Nasty man, we'll never see you again.

450
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,951
- Hope he breaks his neck.
- Get the hell out of here!

451
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,071
- Come on, let's ride him out of here!
- Why, you son of a bitch.

452
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,152
It's all right, folks.

453
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,799
Yeah, it's all right.

454
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,475
Hey, come back here!

455
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,234
Cable Hogue, you're no damn good!

456
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,312
- I'll be back!
- You aren't either!

457
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,310
You hussy!

458
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,399
Welcome back to the fold, brother.

459
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,831
Drink up, preacher.

460
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,152
Gonna get spruced up.
Going back in amongst them.

461
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,273
I got unfinished business in Deaddog.

462
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,509
Amen.

463
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,110
Thank you.

464
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,989
That collar comes off as easy
as it goes on.

465
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,915
Of course. If I cannot rouse heaven,
I intend to raise hell.

466
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,636
You see?

467
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,475
I told you. Went clean through.

468
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,873
She took her.

469
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,189
Children, we are gathered here under
the sight of the Lord Almighty...

470
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,715
Not now, Josh.

471
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,754
Hildy...

472
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,674
Now, Josh.

473
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,119
Children, we are gathered here under
the sight of the Lord Almighty...

474
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,196
Cable Hogue, take off your damn boots.

475
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,149
Now, that's better.

476
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,192
Well, the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

477
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,278
Good evening.

478
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,069
Just passing through.

479
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,713
Yes?

480
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,596
My apologies for intruding
in your time of obvious grief...

481
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,237
...but being a man of the cloth
I could not pass your door...

482
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,109
...without at least offering you
the solace of my services.

483
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,958
I am Reverend
Joshua Duncan Sloane.

484
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,199
Reverend, thank you for coming.

485
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,437
Come, child, take my hand.

486
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,717
The Lord works in many ways.

487
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,036
Sometimes, when he has dealt too much
for one to bear...

488
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,998
...he sends a messenger
to comfort and love.

489
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,798
- He does?
- Yes.

490
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,190
Such a messenger am I.

491
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,478
Come, child, lay your head
on my shoulder.

492
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,914
This is a shoulder for the grieving...

493
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,040
...a hand to be gripped in despair...

494
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,750
...a vial to pour one's heart into.

495
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,636
My only mission in life
is that of comfort and love...

496
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,635
...which I humbly offer you now.
- Oh, thank you, Reverend.

497
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,199
Now...

498
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,673
...what great weight can I lift
from your tortured soul?

499
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,315
It's Frank.

500
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,190
Frank? Frank. Where?

501
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,431
He's dead.

502
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,272
I just got the telegram today.

503
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,237
- Happened in Gila.
- How terrible.

504
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,231
He's been gone two days
and two weeks.

505
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,072
How pitiful.

506
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,835
Weep your heart into mine, child,
for it is weeping with you.

507
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,596
I will be the reservoir for your sorrow.
And your guide for a brighter tomorrow.

508
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,112
Reverend Sloane, it's so good to know
that somebody cares.

509
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,796
Thank not me, I am but an emissary
of the kingdom of heavenly love.

510
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,554
Out of the depth of your sorrow...

511
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,396
...we shall find the beauty of his love.

512
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,756
Even now as we stand here
in his shadow...

513
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,230
...feel your grief subside...

514
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:18,952
...as I absorb it through my palm
and into my hand.

515
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,156
I do, Reverend.

516
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,914
Feel your pain...

517
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,908
...flowing freely...

518
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,310
...out of your heart...

519
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,674
...and into my hand.

520
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,150
I feel it.

521
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,830
Come, child.

522
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,356
Together we shall purge this grief
from your soul...

523
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:48,629
...and release your true spirit
as we search a path to righteousness.

524
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,114
Claudia, it's me.

525
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,356
It's my husband.

526
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,472
- But he's the telegram.
- No, that's Frank, my brother.

527
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,916
- Clete doesn't know yet.
- Clete?

528
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,356
Claudia. Open the goddamn door!

529
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,319
Would you help console Clete
like you did me?

530
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,472
- Claudia!
- They were very close.

531
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,150
- What the hell is going on here?
- Silence.

532
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,835
There's been a death in the family.

533
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,514
It's Frank. He's dead.

534
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,110
Kneel.

535
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,671
Bow your heads.

536
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,673
In this, your moment of need,
I will comfort you.

537
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,151
Yea, I will comfort you.

538
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,879
And bring you to a better understanding
of the mysteries of life...

539
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,750
...and death...

540
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,311
...and love.

541
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,473
Thank you, Reverend.

542
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,756
I loved that kid, Reverend.

543
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,239
Crazy loon that he was.

544
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,069
I know.

545
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,796
I know.

546
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,274
She was a treasure waiting to be found.

547
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,557
A dew-kissed flower
sparkling in the sunrise.

548
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,678
- Her breath was that of a wanton angel.
- She's married.

549
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,196
I shall walk in her breezes,
bask in the rays of her beauty...

550
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,920
...lie in the golden arches
of her passions.

551
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,914
Oh, brother Hogue, it grieves me bad
to think of her with that goliath.

552
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,476
Your cup run dry, preacher.

553
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,279
Man's a poor sport
when another pleasures his woman.

554
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,750
I don't pleasure them, brother Hogue.
I baptize them...

555
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,037
...with loving care. That's all she needs.

556
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,510
There's been a death in the family,
and she needs help. My help.

557
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,877
Her husband will give her all the help
she needs or wants.

558
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,160
Hildy? Who gives her all the help she
needs and wants? You, brother?

559
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,518
Hildy ain't mine.

560
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,038
Nobody owns Hildy. She's got her life
and I got mine, right here.

561
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,278
Right where I wanna be.

562
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,679
That's not exactly true, Cable.

563
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,274
You love that girl.

564
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,835
Hey, up and at them! You're no help
to me sitting there on your ass!

565
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,510
Brother, sometimes I question
your sanity.

566
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,591
You don't know nothing
about swapping.

567
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,399
I gave a week's
watering rights for all this.

568
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,279
- That's a man's swap.
- You can't sleep unless...

569
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,115
...you're bedded on lizards and rocks?
- It ain't true.

570
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,669
Only thing I like about cities. City beds.

571
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:54,516
- My little Claudia springs to mind.
- I'll just bet she does.

572
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,399
I ought to venture into Deaddog
and pay my respects.

573
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,916
- Burning with passion, preacher?
- What about yours, brother Hogue?

574
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,718
I ain't never had a passion.

575
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,758
What do you call that vengeance
that gnaws at your soul?

576
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,708
That's the passion that'll nurture
the dandelions above your grave.

577
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,396
Taggart and Bowen left me to die.

578
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,711
If my feet don't get cold
and my legs will stay under me...

579
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,599
...I aim to kill them.
I don't call that a passion.

580
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,511
- "Vengeance is mine," sayeth the Lord.
- Well, that's fair enough with me.

581
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,752
Just as long as he don't take too long
and I can watch.

582
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,910
Get up there!

583
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,110
Did it ever occur to you, Cable...

584
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,716
...how wise and bountiful God was...

585
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,269
...to put breasts on a woman?

586
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,390
Just the right number in just
the right place. Ever notice that?

587
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,348
Well, where in the hell else would he
put them? On their backside?

588
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,996
It's a thought.

589
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,515
Have you ever noticed
a female person's legs?

590
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,879
Of course I have. Some go all the way
up to the lady's ass, others stop below.

591
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:57,114
The thigh, the soft abundance of the
female thigh. Have you ever noticed?

592
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,599
Cable.

593
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,593
There appears to be...

594
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,314
...a small hole in the sack.

595
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,638
- Howdy, Mr. Cushing.
- Afternoon.

596
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,078
- Thought I might pay you a visit.
- Well, this is it. Cable Springs.

597
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,674
You've done remarkable things
with $ 100.

598
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,957
Thank you, Mr. Cushing.

599
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,715
- I see you've got neighbors.
- Fred, keep that thing working.

600
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,313
Yeah, they'd like to be.

601
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,995
- Tell me, have they found anything?
- Not a drop.

602
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,516
And they've been digging for 13 days.

603
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,236
Any sign of water down there, fellas?

604
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,234
Looks like I bought the right
two acres, eh, fellas?

605
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,953
All right, Hogue, all right.
I give up, damn it.

606
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,112
Don't fill up the holes.
Just pick up those ladders.

607
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,317
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Let's go get a drink.

608
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,391
Never did like water anyway.

609
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,034
Good afternoon, Mr. Cushing.

610
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,869
Well, you got us, Hogue. We're beat.

611
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,917
Here's your contract.

612
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,752
I've already signed it.

613
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,038
Everything comes to he who waits.

614
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,675
Just sign your name right there.

615
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,079
That makes it official.
You're in business, Cable.

616
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,952
By the way, Hogue, I reckon this is
about the most important thing of all.

617
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,317
- Yeah? What's it gonna cost me?
- Nothing.

618
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,190
Well, now.

619
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,871
If that don't beat all.

620
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,594
Gonna have to buy you a flagpole.

621
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,157
I'll make my own.

622
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,436
Hey there.

623
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,433
Hey there. More, please. More.

624
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,592
Would you mind if I had
a tiny bit more also?

625
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,716
It's really very tasty.

626
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,718
- Good heavens.
- Nailed them down.

627
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,151
Makes them easier to wash.

628
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,592
Keep track.

629
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,754
- It's delicious.
- Desert stew.

630
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,233
- Good, fresh meat.
- What's in it?

631
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,751
- Jack rabbit.
- Coq au vin.

632
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,879
- Coq au vin? What's coq au vin?
- Coq au vin.

633
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,918
Breast of quail, dove thighs,
that sort of thing.

634
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:10,200
Yeah. Rattlesnake, ground squirrel...

635
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,632
...black gopher, horny toad,
grasshoppers for seasoning...

636
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,758
...and pack rats and prairie dogs
to fill in.

637
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,519
Of course, if you get ahold
of a wild onion, that'll help.

638
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,276
You see, out here what you gotta do is,
you gotta work and make do.

639
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,157
Hey, wait a minute, there's dessert!

640
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,119
Matthew, stop eating that!

641
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,593
Matthew, I'll spank the living daylights
out of you.

642
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,910
- All aboard!
- Matthew?

643
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,548
Matthew? Now, I said hurry, Matthew.
Come on.

644
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,396
All right, let's go, folks.
All aboard for Deaddog!

645
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,953
Cable, I'm off into Deaddog. The call
is upon me and cannot be ignored...

646
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,032
...without endangering my soul.
- Your soul?

647
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,954
- Careful your ass don't get shot.
- I'm doing the Lord's work.

648
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,350
It's a hell of a name to call it.

649
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,478
I reckon you're right.

650
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,116
- Josh, tell Hildy...
- I will, Cable. I'll give her your love.

651
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:20,353
That's all you can do. You can't convince
Hildy with anything but hard cash!

652
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,752
We'll see about that, Cable. We'll see.

653
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,273
Hildy, I don't know why you're here,
but I'm mighty glad you are.

654
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,635
I was asked to leave.

655
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,196
By the good people of the town.

656
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,033
Good people? Deaddog?

657
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,270
I never met any.

658
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,549
Except you.

659
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,272
Ain't got around to doing my dishes yet.

660
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,439
Sun makes them real pure, you see.

661
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,236
See Joshua?

662
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,956
Surely did.

663
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:14,513
Oh, he talks a lot, Cable...

664
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,511
...and well too.

665
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,632
But, you know, I just ain't ready
to be saved yet.

666
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,909
You make yourself to home.
Right at home. I'll be right back.

667
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,158
- Now?
- Now.

668
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,313
You've been awful nice to me, Hogue.

669
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,397
Never bothered you none what I am?

670
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,314
Hell, no, it never bothered me.

671
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,672
I enjoyed it.

672
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,912
Well, what the hell are you?

673
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,753
Human being. Try the best you can.

674
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,276
- We all got our own ways of living.
- And loving?

675
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,755
Gets mighty Ionesome without it.

676
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,314
You know, Miss Hildy,
sometimes out here alone at night...

677
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,597
Well, sometimes, I wonder
what the hell I'm doing out here.

678
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:05,069
- Why don't you live in town?
- I don't know about that.

679
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,434
In town I'd be nothing.
I don't like being nothing.

680
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,158
Been that before.

681
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,751
Out here I, well...

682
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,191
...got a good start.

683
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,476
- If you'd like to stay on awhile...
- Hogue, it's not my kind of life.

684
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,110
I can't stay.
We just don't think the same.

685
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,159
San Francisco for me.

686
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,271
But not tonight.

687
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,071
Now, that is a picture.

688
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,631
You've seen it before.

689
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,153
Lady...

690
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,159
...nobody's ever seen you before.

691
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,598
Blackie! Get on, boy!

692
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,512
Get up, boy!

693
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,274
Three hours early.

694
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,231
- What?
- Stagecoach.

695
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,949
Well, go get me a robe.

696
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,395
It's too little. Go get my robe.

697
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,310
Welcome to Cable Springs.

698
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,999
Get up there!

699
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,710
Won't be here much longer.

700
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,470
If I don't go now,
won't be much use in going later.

701
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,671
Soon as they come.

702
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,830
What if they never come?

703
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,229
Whoa, whoa, boy.

704
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:56,313
It ain't worth it, Hogue.
Revenge always turns sour.

705
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,596
You ought to just forget them.

706
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,751
Some things a man can't forget.

707
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,435
I got me two of them,
Taggart and Bowen.

708
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,919
I've been waiting a long time, Hildy.

709
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,237
Well, you couldn't handle them last time.

710
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,917
Next time you'll probably
just get yourself killed.

711
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:34,190
Even if you did get them, and you got
to San Francisco, how'd you find me?

712
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,239
Don't you worry none about that.
I'll find you.

713
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,355
But it's a big town, Hogue. A real city.

714
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,074
I don't care where you are, Hildy.

715
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:51,235
I said I'd find you
and I aim to do just that.

716
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,510
And quit changing the subject.

717
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,278
I think he's after me, Cable.

718
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,396
- He's gonna kill me.
- Then keep moving.

719
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,039
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

720
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,915
She was not a sister in purity.

721
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:21,278
I found her weeping by the stable. Clete
had taken to drink and left the child.

722
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,795
- And?
- Well, I consoled her for days.

723
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,077
Lovely days and nights.
He returned, the woman went to him...

724
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,879
...confessed and begged for forgiveness.
- So?

725
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,589
He never forgave me.
He swears I won't leave this desert alive.

726
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,354
- Good luck, preacher.
- Every moment we argue...

727
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,752
...death rides closer. We're in trouble.
- We? I never diddled nobody's wife!

728
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,878
To err is human, brother,
to forgive is divine.

729
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,719
Somebody's coming.

730
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,799
You better hide yourself.

731
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,872
- Don't go in the bedroom, Hildy's there.
- From Deaddog?

732
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,715
That's the one. And you better behave,
or I'll come gunning for you.

733
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,116
Morning, Preacher Sloane.

734
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,153
Good morning, Hildy.

735
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,279
- Can I help you, mister?
- Yeah, whose horse is that?

736
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,829
- Which one?
- The one that's all lathered up.

737
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,638
Oh, that.

738
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,318
That's mine.

739
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,596
- What's its name?
- That? That's...

740
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,514
Old Alexander.

741
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,433
I will protect you.
The violence might spread inside.

742
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,353
Joshua, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

743
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,314
Funny name for a mare.

744
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,197
Well...

745
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:24,592
...like the lady said to the sailor,
it all depends on how you look at it.

746
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,676
Yea, I will protect you as a shepherd
protects his flock.

747
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,308
Yeah, well, I heard about
them sheepherders...

748
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,074
...and you ain't sticking my feet
in your boots.

749
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,073
You listen to me.
I want that son of a bitch.

750
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,915
I'll pay a hundred dollars in gold,
wet or dry, dead or alive.

751
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,877
A hundred dollars?

752
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,469
- If I see him, you'll get him.
- I better.

753
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,232
So long, fella.

754
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,834
- Don't forget.
- I won't.

755
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,116
You better not.

756
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,318
Preacher! I told you to stay
the hell out of there!

757
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,630
Thank you, Cable, for sanctuary.

758
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,755
- My dear, this smells delicious.
- Thank you, Joshua.

759
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,394
- It is good.
- Hold up there, preacher.

760
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,597
- That'll be 50 cents.
- Oh, that's hardly fair.

761
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:21,839
- Not fair? He should pay me double.
- Why? You haven't charged me nothing.

762
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,679
That's because you
haven't charged me nothing.

763
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,320
Oh, brother, you really are
a true Samaritan.

764
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,711
Don't push your luck, Josh.

765
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,832
- Wouldn't you like to say grace?
- Not over my food.

766
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,716
Very well, then, I'll say grace.

767
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,916
Dear Lord, we thank thee
for all this good food...

768
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,640
...and that we can share it as one.

769
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,030
We thank thee for thy goodness
and thy mercy.

770
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,789
Bless this food, O Lord...

771
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,753
And bless this house.

772
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,669
- Amen.
- Amen.

773
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,513
Amen.

774
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,549
Thank you, Hildy.

775
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,793
Hogue...

776
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,914
...I'll be leaving tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

777
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,232
You knew I was only gonna stay
one day, maybe two.

778
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,359
It's been over three weeks already.

779
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:57,717
- It can't be.
- Has, though.

780
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,717
Guess I got used to your cooking and all.

781
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,068
It has been nice hearing you sing.

782
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,753
I admit, I thought a lot about staying.

783
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,512
You treated me like a real lady, Hogue.

784
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,751
You were good to me.

785
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,793
Not good enough?

786
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,079
Maybe too good, I don't know.

787
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,070
I just can't handle it.

788
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,191
Thank you very much for everything,
but I'm leaving.

789
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,592
Excuse me.

790
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,790
Sort of lost my appetite.

791
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,278
I better find you
a place to sleep, preacher.

792
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,998
No need.

793
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,316
That bed in there will suit me
just fine and dandy.

794
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,469
It's fine and dandy, but it ain't yours.

795
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,030
Well, isn't a guest
entitled to bed and board?

796
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,394
A paying guest.

797
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,552
Oh, stop it. Both of you
gonna sleep outside tonight.

798
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,077
Outside, both of you.

799
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,518
- Good night, Cable.
- Good night, Josh.

800
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:47,712
Morning, brother Hogue.
Sleep well last night?

801
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,359
Nope.

802
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,473
- Is Hildy up yet?
- Left early.

803
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,392
- How do you know?
- Well, you know how it is, Josh.

804
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,358
Funny thing...

805
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,399
...it doesn't matter how much
or how little you've wandered around...

806
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,790
...how many women you've been with.

807
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,990
Every once in awhile, one of them...

808
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,720
...cuts right through.

809
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,673
Right straight into you.

810
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,716
What do you do about it?

811
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:46,911
I suppose maybe when you die
you get over it.

812
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,238
So long, Cable.

813
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,037
So long, Josh.

814
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,911
It's me!

815
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:51,071
Cable Hogue!

816
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,951
Right here!

817
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,113
Waiting.

818
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:08,510
Right here! Waiting!

819
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,518
Come on, boy. Get with it.

820
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,396
Come on, Blackie! Get in.

821
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,434
Get in there, boy.

822
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,918
Whoa, boy.

823
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,950
Don't feed them, we're just staying
long enough to water the horses.

824
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,720
- And we're running late.
- All right, Ben.

825
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,390
Welcome to Cable Springs.

826
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,837
It's out in the back, ma'am.

827
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:36,032
I was wondering and worrying if you got
out of there all right. Glad you made it.

828
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,754
Howdy, Cable.

829
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,589
Hogue.

830
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,912
Come on and have a drink of the
best damn water for 50 mile around.

831
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,036
I found it where it wasn't.

832
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,955
- How long you had this place?
- Three years and a half.

833
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,474
Pretty big layout.

834
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,555
Well, I owe it all to you boys.

835
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:29,471
When I come out of there, I found this
water hole and just went into business.

836
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,551
Looks like you done real well.

837
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,309
Big, fat bankbook, huh, Cable?

838
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,756
Hogue in a bank?
You don't know him better than that...

839
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:44,478
...you don't know him at all.

840
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,312
Here you go, Cable.

841
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,869
Another month paid in full.

842
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,515
No, no banks for me.

843
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,468
I'll just put this in the old sock,
and I got it well hid.

844
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,633
- We're glad to hear you're doing so well.
- If I was doing half as good...

845
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,429
...I'd be a rich son of a bitch
instead of just a poor one.

846
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:08,599
All right, folks, let's go!
All aboard for Deaddog!

847
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,149
Well, I owe it all to you boys.

848
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,993
Now, you come back
and see me, now, you hear?

849
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,435
- We will.
- One of these days.

850
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,511
Now, you can count on it.

851
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:36,838
Blackie, get out of there. Come on, boy.

852
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,156
Get out of there.

853
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,151
- See you, Hogue.
- So long, Ben.

854
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:57,550
<i>Taggart and Bowen</i>
<i>As quick as you please</i>

855
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:01,713
<i>Took all the money and left for the trees</i>

856
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,836
Hey, Cable?

857
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,434
We come for that visit.

858
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,318
Cable!

859
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,469
I don't think he's here.

860
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,188
No, I don't think he is.

861
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,032
You check inside.

862
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:33,031
Come on, get up there.

863
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,238
We'll drink all your water, Cable.

864
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,039
<i>We'll drink your well dry</i>

865
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,790
<i>Water goes good with a bottle of rye</i>

866
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,430
Bowen. Bowen!

867
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,794
Just lookie what we got here.

868
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,557
Another one.

869
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,917
What do you think?

870
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,230
Well, we found the copper.

871
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,353
Gold and silver gotta be next.

872
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,399
Why in hell don't we just wait
till he comes back?

873
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,996
- Let him do the digging?
- Suits me, boys.

874
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,477
- You heard that.
- Shut up.

875
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,392
Come on out.

876
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,234
With your hands up, fellas.

877
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,799
Think it over.

878
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,796
I got lots of time.

879
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,554
What's he doing?

880
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:09,599
Well, I ain't gonna poke my head
over the edge to find out.

881
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,268
Hogue?

882
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,074
You know you ain't got no guts.

883
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,633
Why, last time you had a gun on us
you didn't use it.

884
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,439
Yeah, now, of course that's a fact.

885
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,991
You said I was yellow.

886
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,951
Wanna try your luck again?

887
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,432
- He's bluffing.
- Yeah, yeah.

888
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,955
Sun's kind of hot, ain't it, fellas?

889
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:37,078
Of course you could enjoy it
if you had plenty of water.

890
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,591
And that's what I got, plenty of water.

891
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,479
- Get over. Right up there.
- Right there.

892
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,234
I ain't running this time, fellas.

893
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,231
- Staying right here.
- Your gun.

894
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:55,758
- Sooner or later you gotta come out.
- Three count. Ready? Ready?

895
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,518
One, two...

896
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,113
...now!

897
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,793
- We got him.
- He might still be alive.

898
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,918
Take a look.

899
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:19,510
- You're sure?
- Damn it, take a look.

900
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,516
Give me a boost.

901
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,510
Easy and up we go.

902
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,115
Little higher, Taggart.

903
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,558
- Get up there.
- No. Just easy.

904
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,994
Easy.

905
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:42,438
Put me down.
Put me down, damn it, down!

906
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,909
- We never touched him.
- Where is he?

907
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,470
Well, why in the hell
don't you take a look?

908
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,197
Now what's he up to?

909
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,519
Hey, Taggart.

910
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,912
Oh, my God. Taggart, help me.

911
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:12,274
Hey. Hey!

912
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,759
- Hey, Taggart.
- Oh, my God.

913
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,428
Hey! Taggart!

914
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,871
Taggart. Son of a bitch, Taggart.
Please, Taggart.

915
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:27,599
God.

916
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,228
- Taggart, I'm leaving this place.
- Not without me.

917
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,150
Hold up there, boys.

918
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,832
Now, you can start taking off your duds.

919
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,112
Get them off.

920
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,511
Keep your underwear, that's all.

921
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,316
And your boots, get them off.

922
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,673
Boots.

923
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,833
- Socks too.
- Socks?

924
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,599
Now...

925
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:22,116
...you're gonna head back out
through them hills.

926
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,872
Because if I catch you on a road,
I'm gonna kill you.

927
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,508
But there's no water.

928
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,277
And don't that sound familiar?

929
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,396
I ain't going.

930
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,832
You ain't got the guts, Hogue.

931
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,351
No. No, no.

932
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,078
No, Cable.

933
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,673
No.

934
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,670
Hey, what's that?

935
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,637
- What?
- That.

936
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:09,435
I seen one once before.

937
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,798
- Out here, on them roads?
- It go anywhere.

938
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:21,271
Help! Help!

939
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,317
He's gonna kill me!

940
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:24,913
Kill me!

941
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,274
Stop!

942
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:27,953
Stop!

943
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:35,439
You damn, dumb, dumb bastards.

944
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:41,078
Horseless carriage.
Don't look that good to me.

945
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,831
Went right on by.

946
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,353
Well...

947
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:06,199
...that's gonna be
the next fella's worry.

948
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:50,354
I can't go it out there, Cable.

949
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,710
- That right?
- It wasn't my fault.

950
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,599
All I did was...

951
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:03,479
I'm sorry, Cable.

952
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:09,875
You know how it was with Taggart.

953
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,353
Yeah, I know.

954
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,792
Bury him.

955
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,678
Bury him.

956
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,996
He's under.

957
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:24,478
Good.

958
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,230
What else would you like me to do?

959
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,310
What kind of a cockeyed
schedule is this?

960
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,517
Ain't got no passengers,
just two, three sacks of mail.

961
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,353
Well, it don't matter really.
I'm leaving.

962
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,636
- Leaving?
- You leaving the desert?

963
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,394
It's a big world, fellas.
I wanna see some of it.

964
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,118
Next stop, San Francisco.

965
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,508
You serious?

966
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,114
So you're really going in
amongst them, Hogue?

967
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:06,191
- Shoot, that ain't like you.
- Ain't it?

968
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,669
- You just watch me.
- He means it.

969
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:11,718
- You bet I mean it.
- Now, hold on.

970
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,440
You just can't up and leave
the station like this.

971
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:18,115
Well, what are we gonna do
between Deaddog and Lizard?

972
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:28,830
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet my former partner...

973
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,070
...Samuel D. Bowen.

974
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,590
Hey, get some clothes on.

975
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,352
Yes, sir.

976
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,438
Now, wait a minute.

977
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,989
- You can't leave some fool...
- Samuel D. Bowen!

978
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:46,516
...running around in his long johns
in charge here.

979
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,590
My God, what's that?

980
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:54,158
Ugly-Iooking damn thing, ain't it?

981
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,032
Kind of strange, moving all by itself.

982
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,430
I seen two before.

983
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,271
That there lady is Hildy.

984
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,832
Hi, Hogue.

985
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,358
The ladiest damn lady I ever saw.

986
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,392
I beg your pardon, sir.

987
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:32,273
- Might I borrow a tank of water?
- No.

988
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:35,000
No, no.

989
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,156
Mr. Cable Hogue don't
let nobody borrow nothing.

990
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,953
Hey, Cable?

991
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,752
Cable.

992
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:09,238
How much water you think
this thing will take?

993
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,152
Three, maybe four horses' worth?

994
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:15,313
Well, how the hell would I know?
You're in charge here, Bowen.

995
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:22,599
That'll be five horses' worth,
not a cent less.

996
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:26,275
Pull it up on the rise
and help me fetch the water.

997
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,992
Get that damn thing out of here...

998
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:45,357
...before my team takes a notion
to tromp the hell out of it.

999
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,036
Hildy, you do look fine.

1000
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:57,797
I guess you found one of those rich
husbands you was always looking for.

1001
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:01,234
Well, let's just put it
this way, Hogue.

1002
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,630
I ain't hurting no more.

1003
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:11,315
I was just headed for New Orleans.

1004
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:17,713
I stopped by to check
to see if maybe you was ready.

1005
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:20,958
I'm ready.

1006
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,793
You'd leave your desert, Hogue?

1007
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,474
Hell, I've already gone, honey.

1008
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,392
I'll go get ready.

1009
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:37,915
I'll be back in a minute.

1010
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:43,637
We got nothing but time, Hogue...

1011
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,030
...nothing but time.

1012
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,839
Hey, fellas, I'm headed
for New Orleans, in style.

1013
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,878
By God, I wish
I was going with you.

1014
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:06,679
Hey.

1015
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,994
I seen two before.

1016
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:21,473
I guess you need the water
for the steam, huh?

1017
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,918
- No. It burns gasoline.
- Oh, yeah, burns it. Yeah.

1018
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,198
Did you hear that, Cable?
It burns gasoline.

1019
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,430
Well, of course it does.

1020
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:37,276
You know, maybe a fella could pick up
some extra money selling that too.

1021
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,829
That gasoline.

1022
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:45,794
Mister, that'll cost you 10 cents more.

1023
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,432
Hey, Bowen.

1024
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:53,436
- Hogue, watch out.
- Hold it.

1025
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:55,153
Hold it.

1026
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:02,350
Oh, my God. Hogue?

1027
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:11,477
Son of a bitch
kicks worse than a mule.

1028
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,315
- You hurt, Cable?
- Hell, I'm all right.

1029
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,035
No, I'm not.

1030
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:25,872
Hell, Hogue. It's a long ways
from your heart and on the wrong side.

1031
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:39,473
Well, thanks, fellas.

1032
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:41,949
Much better out here.

1033
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,193
Josh.

1034
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:03,320
Well, well, brother Hogue.

1035
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,913
What's all this?

1036
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:07,630
What in the hell is that?

1037
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,870
Just a means of transportation.

1038
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:13,510
- Well, it sure is an ugly thing.
- You don't look so good, Cable.

1039
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:17,070
- Are you in trouble?
- No trouble, just dying. Last reckoning.

1040
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:20,038
Well, it comes to us all.
Prepare yourself, Cable.

1041
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:24,034
Oh, shut up, Joshua. It ain't so.

1042
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,077
You'll be up and around in no time.

1043
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,595
- Cable?
- Yep.

1044
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,751
I wanna thank you
for what you've done.

1045
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:35,035
And here I waited three years
to get even with you.

1046
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:37,430
I was gonna piss on your grave.

1047
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:48,590
Boys, when I go just bury me where
the sand's soft and the digging's easy.

1048
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,638
Oh, hush, Cable.
You're gonna be just fine.

1049
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:55,156
Hildy. That man you was married to...

1050
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:01,393
He died about a month back
of a stroke, in bed.

1051
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:05,870
But he died happy.

1052
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,193
I'll just bet he did.

1053
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:14,751
As a matter of fact, if you gents would
be kind enough to move me inside...

1054
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:18,230
...I'd kind of like to throw a little...
- Oh, Cable Hogue.

1055
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,277
- Hang in there.
- Brother Hogue...

1056
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:24,956
...this is a time for deep and serious
reflection, not of base and vile lust.

1057
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,033
Josh, it's about time
you earned your keep.

1058
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:34,269
- Preach me a funeral sermon.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.

1059
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:39,470
A good one. Don't make me out no
saint, but don't put me down too deep.

1060
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,949
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

1061
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,475
It's not so much the dying
that you hate...

1062
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,916
...it's not knowing what they're
gonna say about you, that's all.

1063
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:51,595
Now, all my life I've been
scared of this living.

1064
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,478
Now...

1065
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,310
...gotta do the other.

1066
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,829
Well, come on, now,
I can't wait all day.

1067
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,877
I ain't got any time.

1068
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:06,191
- Brethren!
- Bull's eye! See?

1069
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:09,716
We are gathered here...

1070
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,631
...in the sight of God and all his glory...

1071
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:19,191
...to lay to rest Cable Hogue.
- Cable Hogue. Amen to that.

1072
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:25,438
Now, most funeral orations,
Lord, lie about a man.

1073
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:29,635
Compare him to the angels,
whitewash him with a really wide brush.

1074
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:33,554
But, you know, Lord,
and I know that it just is not true.

1075
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,948
Hang in there, preacher.

1076
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:38,715
Now, a man is made out of bad
as well as good, all of us.

1077
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,078
Cable Hogue was born into this world,
nobody knows when or where.

1078
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,676
He came stumbling out of the
wilderness like a prophet of old.

1079
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:48,273
Sounds right, is right.

1080
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:52,194
Out of the barren wastes
he carved himself a one-man kingdom.

1081
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:54,715
- I don't know.
- Some said he was ruthless.

1082
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,713
- Who said that?
- More than one, Hogue.

1083
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:00,269
But you could do worse, Lord...

1084
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:04,718
...than to take to your bosom
Cable Hogue.

1085
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,078
He wasn't really a good man,
he wasn't a bad man.

1086
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,349
But, Lord, he was a man.

1087
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:15,270
Amen to that.

1088
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,475
He charged too much...

1089
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,754
...he was as stingy as they come.

1090
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:28,277
Yes, he might have cheated,
but he was square about it.

1091
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:31,716
Rich or poor,
he gouged them all the same.

1092
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,871
When Cable Hogue died...

1093
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:37,112
...there wasn't an animal
in the desert he didn't know.

1094
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:41,233
There wasn't a star
in the firmament he hadn't named.

1095
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:45,113
There wasn't a man he was afraid of.

1096
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:55,910
Now the sand he fought and loved
so long has covered him at last.

1097
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:59,356
Now he has gone into
the whole torrent of the years...

1098
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,796
...of the souls that pass
and never stop.

1099
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:07,639
In some ways he was
your dim reflection, Lord...

1100
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,078
...and right or wrong,
I feel he is worth consideration.

1101
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:14,151
But if you feel he is not...

1102
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:18,836
...you should know that Hogue
lived then died here in the desert.

1103
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:23,195
And I'm sure hell will
never be too hot for him.

1104
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:29,549
He never went to church.

1105
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:32,952
He didn't need to.

1106
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:36,592
The whole desert was his cathedral.

1107
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:38,193
Hold up!

1108
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:40,794
I'm coming in tonight.

1109
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:43,151
Hogue loved the desert...

1110
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:45,675
...Ioved it deeper than he'd ever say.

1111
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:48,274
He built his empire...

1112
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:52,752
...but was man enough to give it up
for love when the time came.

1113
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:09,712
Lord, as the day draws toward evening,
this life grows to an end for us all.

1114
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,713
We say adieu to our friend.

1115
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:17,119
Take him, Lord.

1116
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:25,675
But knowing Cable,
I suggest you do not take him lightly.

1117
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:29,758
Amen.
