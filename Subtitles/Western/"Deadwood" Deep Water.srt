IS THIS FOR ME?

BROUGHT IT FOR YOU.

16
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,267
GET OUT.

17
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:27,801
POINTED THE GUN
AT HIM!

18
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,934
BOOM, SHOT HIM
RIGHT THERE!

19
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:32,000
THAT'S THE GUY
OVER THERE.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,968
HIM AND WILD BILL
GOT THE GUY RIGHT
IN THE EYE.

YOU TOUCH THAT
HOTEL'S KITCHEN, SETH?

22
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,300

YEAH, FELLA TO BE
PUT IN THAT BOX

25
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,133
MIGHT ARGUE WITH YOU,
REVEREND.

26
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,501
MR. BULLOCK
DID NOT DRAW FIRST.

27
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:11,634
AND I POINT TO HIS
COMMISSIONING ME

28
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,167
TO BUILD THE DEPARTED
A COFFIN

29
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,968
AND SEE TO HIS
CHRISTIAN BURIAL.

30
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,734
WELL, ANY IDEA
OF THE DEPARTED'S NAME?

31
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:21,567
IN HIS EFFECTS I FOUND
A LETTER ADDRESSED
TO TOM MASON.

32
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,834
WELL, I KNOW
A TOM MASON.

33
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,033
BUT THAT FELLER
KEEPING COOL IN THE CREEK,
THAT AIN'T HIM.

34
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,834
WHICH, HAVING PRAYED,
I DECIDED TO OPEN.

35
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:31,667
 <i>THE SENDER, MRS. WALTER</i>
 <i>MASON WRITES,</i>

36

"I'VE ASKED YOUR BROTHER NED

37
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:38,868
FROM WHICH I CONCLUDE
THE DEPARTED'S NAME IS NED.

38
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,634
NED MASON, HUH?

39
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:43,801
PERHAPS THE TOM MASON

MAN'S BROTHER?

 <i>IF HE IS IN CAMP</i>
 <i>HE SHOULD BE NOTIFIED.</i>

47
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:04,934
I CAN TELL YOU

48
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,834
- LEFT YOUR HOTEL, HAS HE?
- MOVED TO WU'S PIGSTY.

49
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:11,434

SHOOTOUT ABOUT?

50
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:14,300

SUSPECTED HE WAS
IN ON THE KILL.

55

58
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,234
( leg dragging )

59
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:34,534
IF YOU DON'T STOP DRAGGING
THAT FUCKING LEG...

00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,567
COFFEE?

61
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,367
I MIGHT HAVE
ONE CUP.

62
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,767
DID YOU KNOW ONE
SQUAREHEAD LIVED?

63
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:46,067
LITTLE SQUAREHEAD GIRL.
THEY TOOK HER TO THE DOC'S.

64
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:48,234
- WHAT CONDITION?
- I DON'T KNOW, AL.

65
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:50,501
IF SHE WAS TO LIVE,

66
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,200
WOULDN'T SHE HAVE
A STORY TO TELL?

67
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,734
( snorts )

68
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,801
WAKE UP.

69
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:35,934
- HOW'S THAT LITTLE ONE?
- SHE'S STILL AMONG US.

70
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:38,534
I'M ASKING YOU WHAT
HER PROSPECTS ARE?

71
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,334
IF HER WOUNDS
DON'T FESTER,

72
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,033
SHE MIGHT CAN HAVE
A FIGHTING CHANCE.

73
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,033
GOOD.

74
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,567
NONE OF THAT
TO HIM.

75
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,567
OH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

76
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,567
NOT A WORD.

77
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,734
- MORNING.
- MORNING, BULLOCK.

78
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:58,167
I WAS WONDERING
HOW THAT CHILD FARED.

79
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,300
IFFY.  TOUCH AND GO.

80
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,501
I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC.

81
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:04,167
HAS SHE SPOKEN?

82
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,067
SHE'S NOT CONSCIOUS.

83
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:08,834
BE SURPRISED
IF SHE EVER IS.

84
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:14,501
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
WHICHEVER WAY IT GOES.

85
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,133
IF YOU SEE BILL HICKOK,

86
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,667
 <i>OR THAT SORE ASSHOLE,</i>
 <i>CHARLIE UTTER,</i>

87
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,634
COULD YOU TELL HIM
I LOOKED TO THE STOCK?

88
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:24,868
SURE, I'LL LET HIM KNOW.

89
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:27,934
YOU'RE WRONG
NOT TO TRUST HIM.

90
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:31,133
HE FORMED A PARTY THAT
FOUND THAT LITTLE ONE

91
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,901
AMONG ALL THE DEAD
OF HER FAMILY.

92
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,501
DIDN'T HE?

93
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:39,334
AND DIDN'T HE ALSO
SHOOT A MAN HE SUSPECTED
IN THE MURDERS?

94
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,167
AND IF I WERE
TO CONFIDE IN HIM

95
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,634
 <i>WOULD HE</i>
 <i>CIRCULATE MY OPTIMISM?</i>
 <i>I MEAN, WOULDN'T HE SAY,</i>

96
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:47,400
"WHEN THE LITTLE ONE SPEAKS,
YOU'LL SEE I WAS RIGHT.

97
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,133
NOT THE SIOUX
KILLED HER FAMILY,
BUT ROAD AGENTS"?

98
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:54,033
AND SUPPOSING
IT WAS ROAD AGENTS,

99
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,367
AND THEY HEAR HIS TALK,

100
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,968
WHERE'S THE LITTLE ONE
STAND THEN?

101
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:03,133
YOU GOT A DARK
TURN OF MIND.

102
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:07,734
I SEE AS MUCH MISERY
OUTTA THEM MOVING TO JUSTIFY
THEIRSELVES

103
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:10,634
AS THEM THAT SET OUT
TO DO HARM.

104
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:21,834
Charlie:
SAME DEAD ROACH
IN THE SAME DAMN BISCUIT.

105
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,901
HE STUCK TO
HIS POSITION.

106
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:27,801
- MORNING.
- MORNING, MONTANA.

107
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,200
YEAH.

108
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,067
- JOE?
- MUCH OBLIGED.

109
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,667
- YOUR FRIEND ASKED ME TO SAY
SHE'S LOOKED TO YOUR STOCK.
- THANKS.

110
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,100
SHE'S BACK NOW WATCHING
OVER THAT CHILD WE FOUND.

111
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,501
FAR AS HER CHANCES,
THE DOC'S NOT OPTIMISTIC.

112
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,501
FROM THE LOOK OF HIM,

113
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:54,000
THINK THAT DOC'S BEEN WRONG
ONCE OR TWICE IN HIS LIFE?

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,467
MAYBE ONCE
OR TWICE.

115
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,634
WE'LL LIKELY BE BY

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,968
- DO WHAT?

TO THE GEM, ELLSWORTH.

171
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:29,567
FURTHER EFFORTS'LL ONLY
BENEFIT THE FARO DEALERS.

172
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,901
THIS EXACT SPOT SHOWED A FISTFUL

173
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:36,300
WELL, DON'T WEAKEN,

174
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,801

176
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:44,501

181
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,467
BUT WHAT I WAS THINKING

182
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:13,601
IS DAMNED IF AL DIDN'T
CENTER SHOOT THE BULL'S-EYE.

183

00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:20,267
BUT IT WAS
PERSIMMON PHIL,

00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,400
TOM MASON AND THAT CROAKER
HEADED FOR HIS COFFIN.

186
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,968

00:20:28,968 --> 00:20:30,434

335
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:32,634
SO GOD KNOWS WHERE
HE GOT OFF TO.

336
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:35,767
THAT'S YOUR CUT THERE.
THAT REFLECTS HE'S OUT.

337
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,501
- THERE'S NO CUT THERE-
- HE CAME HERE.

338
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,968
( sighs )
NO.

339
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:43,467
SAY NO AGAIN,
I'LL MURDER YOU
WHERE YOU SIT.

340
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,501
HE SWORE HE'D HEAD
TO CHEYENNE.

341
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:47,167
YEAH, BUT HERE'S CLOSER,
ISN'T IT?

342
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,534
ALL YOU COCKSUCKERS
GO FOR THE EASIEST CHANCE.

343
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,267
SO, WHERE IS HE NOW?

344
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:58,434
WHERE HE IS NOW IS HE
STIRS THE WHOLE CAMP UP

345
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:00,234
LAST NIGHT WITH
HIS MASSACRE STORY

346
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,734
TILL I'M GIVING LIQUOR
AWAY AND CUNT AT HALF PRICE

347
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,400
JUST TO KEEP
MY CROWD CONTROLLED.

348
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,200
PARTY MAKES UP
FROM NUTTALL'S TO RIDE
BACK OUT TO SPEARFISH.

349
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
WILD BILL HICKOK
AND THOSE TWO GUYS

350
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,868

351
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:15,033
TILL THEY SEE WHAT THE KID
HAS TO SAY ABOUT HIM.

352
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,601
WILD BILL HICKOK?

353
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:19,701
AND NED THROWS DOWN.

354
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:21,434

355
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:24,701
AGAINST HICKOK
AND THIS OTHER COCKSUCKER
WHO DRAWS ALMOST AS FAST.

356
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,000
SO IT'S A TOSSUP
WHO BLEW NED'S HEAD OFF.

357
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,734
CHRIST, AL...

358
00:21:31,734 --> 00:21:35,434
I'M REALLY
SORRY FOR THE BOTHER.

359
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:38,400

 <i>I SWEAR TO FUCKING</i>
 <i>CHRIST, AL.</i>

363
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,767
I DON'T WANT
YOUR FUCKING SHARE.

364
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,968
I DON'T WANT THAT KID
TELLING PEOPLE IN ENGLISH,

00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:54,968

00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,434
THIS CAMP COULD
BE UP FOR GRABS.

368
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,634
GOD KNOWS WHAT THESE
COCKSUCKERS ARE UP TO

369
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,701
OR WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DO ABOUT IT.

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,567
PLEASE DON'T
CUT MY THROAT.

374

DON'T PUT ANY PRESSURE ON IT,
JUST LAY IT ON LIGHT.

385
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,901
IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M PRESSING,
I'M NOT.

386
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:56,901
I'M NOT PUTTING
ANY GODDAMNED PRESSURE!

387
00:22:56,901 --> 00:23:00,000
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

388
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,767
Johnny:
 <i>DOC!</i>

389
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,400
I GOTTA GO.

390
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,534
I EXPECT CARE FOR THEM
WHORE'S BUSINESS AREAS

391
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,601
IS A BIG DAMN PART
OF YOUR INCOME.

392
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,701
THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO?

393
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:19,934
AH, YES.

394
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:22,300
AND DON'T
LET ANYONE IN.

395
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,234
BELIEVE ME, ANYONE TRIES
GETTING IN HERE

396
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,367
WHO'S NOT YOU IS GONNA BE
DAMN FUCKING SORRY.

00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,434
ALL RIGHT.

398
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,801
I MAY NOT
LET YOU BACK.

399
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,667
OUR CHRIST,
AS HE WAS CRUCIFIED

400
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:46,234
ADDRESSED THE THIEF
WHO WAS HANGING BY HIS SIDE.

401
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:48,267
"VERILY I SAY
UNTO THEE, THIS DAY

402
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:52,067
SHALT THOU BE
WITH ME IN PARADISE."

403
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:55,367
 <i>YOUR WAYS ARE NOT</i>
 <i>OUR WAYS, O LORD.</i>

404
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,734
 <i>WE ABIDE THE JUST</i>
 <i>AND THE UNJUST ALIKE</i>

405
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,200
 <i>UNDER YOUR TEARLESS EYE.</i>

406
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
TEARLESS NOT BECAUSE
YOU DO NOT SEE US, 

407
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,667
BUT...

408
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,067
BECAUSE YOU SEE
WHAT WE ARE SO WELL.

409
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:15,901
LAMB OF GOD, WHO TAKEST
AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD,

410
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:19,300
SEND YOUR ANGELS TO WELCOME
THIS BODY INTO PARADISE.

411
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,767
 <i>LAMB OF GOD, WHO TAKEST AWAY</i>
 <i>THE SIN OF THE WORLD,</i>

412
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:25,267

ETERNAL REST.

413
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,734
AMEN.

414
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:30,434
THAT'S A REAL GENEROUS
PERSPECTIVE, REVEREND.

415
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:34,400
AND DON'T WE NEED ALL
THE GENEROSITY WE CAN GET?

416
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,734
THEY BUTT INTO
OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS

417
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:51,901
AND MAKE THE BUSINESS
OF OTHERS THEIR OWN,

418
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:54,667
THESE BOUGHT-OUT
NO-GOOD COCKSUCKERS.

419
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:57,133
WHAT, HICKOK
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

420
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,767
FUCKING BIGSHOT
THAT HE IS.

421
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,167
BIG FUCKING SHOT
WHEN HE'S STANDING
IN FRONT OF YOU.

422
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,267
ONE IN HIS EAR
FROM BEHIND, I'D LIKE
TO SEE

423
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,133
- HOW FUCKING TOUGH HE WAS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.  COCKSUCKER.

424
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,434
- <i>( knocking )</i>
- ANYWAY, REST HIS SOUL.

425
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:10,033
THAT'S ALL.

426
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,634
CONDOLENCES, TOM.

427
00:25:12,634 --> 00:25:14,734
HE'S GONE, JOHNNY.

428
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:17,067
I DON'T THINK
YOU EVER DID MEET HIM.

429
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,701
AH, NO.
DOC'S HERE.

430
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
FUCK HICKOK!

431
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,968
AND WHAT HE DID
TO YOUR POOR BROTHER, HUH?

432
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,868
THIS IS FESTERED

433
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:33,267
BECAUSE YOU WON'T TAKE
A FLAME TO YOUR NEEDLE.

434
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,868
I DO, DOC, EVERY TIME
BEFORE I USE IT.

435
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,667
- STOP LYING.
- ANYWAYS, I'M QUITTING.

436
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,200
THEY SAY YOU'RE LOOKING
TO A LITTLE ONE, DOC.

437
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,467
- HOW'S THAT UNGUENT WORKING?
- IT'S NICE AND COOL
ON ME, DOC.

438
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,601
I'M TRYING JUST A LITTLE
BIT MORE LANOLIN IN IT.

439
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:50,501
HEY, GIVE ME
A DOLLOP OF THAT!

440
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,334
HOW'S THAT PUSSY
LOTION FEEL?

441
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:56,434
SHOULD I TRY
SOME ON MY ASS?

442
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:58,300
AL.

443
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,801
WILL SHE LIVE?

444
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:02,267
LET ME LOOK
AT YOUR BELLY.

445
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:04,300
Woman:
 <i>I DIDN'T KNOW</i>
 <i>YOU CARED, DOC.</i>

446
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,200
WILL WHO LIVE, AL?

447
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,734
NORWEGIAN KID.
HOW MANY CHILDREN
YOU CARING FOR?

448
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,567
I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC.

449
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:12,634
I SEE.

450
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:14,267
WHERE ARE YOU
IN YOUR MOONS?

451
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:16,400
- 'BOUT TWO WEEKS ALONG.
- SHE SPEAK ENGLISH?

452
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
WHAT'S SHE GOTTA SAY
FOR HERSELF ANYWAY?

453
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,334
SHE HASN'T SAID A WORD
OR BEEN CONSCIOUS
FOR A SECOND.

454
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:23,367
OH, TOO BAD.

455
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:27,000
SHE COULD SETTLE
WHO KILLED HER PEOPLE,
ROAD AGENTS OR SIOUX.

456
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,467
I DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THAT.
DOES THAT HURT?

457
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:32,834
- LITTLE BIT.
- IF SHE DOES SEE,
THAT'S THE POINT.

458
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,701
SHE COULD SETTLE IT.

459
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,033
I DOUBT SHE'LL
SETTLE ANYTHING.

460
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,567
I DOUBT WE'LL EVEN KNOW
WHAT LANGUAGE SHE SPOKE.

461
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:46,133
GIVE THESE GIRLS
A GOOD GOING OVER, DOC.

462
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,133
LOOK TO 'EM LIKE
THEY'RE YOUR OWN.

463
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,067
DON'T TELL ME MY JOB
OR HOW LONG TO DO IT IN.

464
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,167
I CAN SEE TO THEM
AND I CAN SEE TO THE WAY

465
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:57,868
I'M GODDAMNED ABLE,
AND THAT IS ALL I CAN
GODDAMNED DO!

466
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:00,534
OH, WHAT'S YOUR TIME
OF THE MONTH, HUH?

467
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:11,901
ARE YOU POORLY, DOC?

468
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:14,767
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
I KNOW WHAT I AM.

469
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,868
WHAT I'M NOT.

470
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:35,133
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

471
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,234
DOC ASKED ME
TO SEE YOUR PATIENT.

472
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:42,767
WHAT FOR?
WHAT DO YOU
KNOW ABOUT IT?

473
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,300
WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU?

474
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,667
HEY, DON'T YOU
FUCKING IGNORE ME!

475
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:54,601
YOU DON'T WANT
TO INTERFERE WITH ME.

476
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,367
- THINK I'M SCARED OF YOU?
- SURE YOU ARE.

477
00:27:57,367 --> 00:27:59,534
IF I TAKE
A KNIFE TO YOU,

478
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:02,067
YOU'LL BE SCARED WORSE
AND A LONG TIME DYING.

479
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:03,934
I AIN'T SCARED
TO DIE.

480
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,367
I AIN'T SCARED
OF NOBODY.

481
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,934
 <i>GET AWAY FROM HER!</i>

482
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,100
LE-- LEAVE--

483
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,334
LEAVE THAT LITTLE
ONE ALONE!

484
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,801
- <i>LEAVE HER ALONE!</i>
- HELLO.

485
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,934
LEAVE HER!
LEAVE--

486
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,267
LEAVE HER ALONE,

487
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,133
DO IT TO ME
IF YOU HAVE TO!

488
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:33,100
WHY WOULD 
I DO IT TO YOU?

489
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,834
( sobbing )

490
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,000
DID YOU HURT HER?

491
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,300
NO.

492
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,434
NO, DOC.

493
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:10,467
BUT SHE'S BETTER
THAN YOU THOUGHT.

494
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:12,834
HER EYES ARE OPEN.

495
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,601
( sobbing )

496
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:35,367
I FELL APART.

497
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:38,100
I COULDN'T LOOK OUT
FOR THE LITTLE ONE.

498
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,968
FUCKER LOOKED AT ME

ALL RIGHT.

501
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,734
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST.

502

NO, I'M NOT THE FIRST.

503
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:54,868
 <i>WHO SAID I WAS</i>
 <i>THE FIRST?</i>

I'LL LOOK AFTER HER.

512

WAS HE A ROAD AGENT?

513
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,100
WAS HE AMONG THEM

514
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,534

00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,701
IN MY OWN FUCKING
PLACE!

664
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:38,334
AND HERE'S MY COUNTER-OFFER
TO YOUR COUNTER-OFFER.

665
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:41,334
GO FUCK YOURSELF!

666
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,801

GET HIM AWAY
FROM ME.

669
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,934
MISTER.

670
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:58,300
THE BEST BATH
AND BLOWJOB YOU EVER HAD'S

671
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,234
NOT 12 STEPS
UP THEM STAIRS.

672
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,968
Trixie:
 <i>MISTER!</i>

673
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,834
Brom:
 <i>I MAY AS WELL</i>
 <i>CONFIDE IN YOU, ALMA.</i>

674
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,467
OF COURSE.

675
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,601
I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL
WE'VE BEEN DUPED.

676
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:20,534
 <i>OUR GOLD CLAIM</i>
 <i>MAY BE WORTHLESS.</i>

677
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:23,000
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK THAT EVEN

678
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,601
SWEARENGEN'S
NAME SHOULD BE ADDED
TO THE CONSPIRATORS' LIST.

679
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:29,334
- HOW DISAPPOINTED
YOU MUST BE.
- I KNOW.

680
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,901
I TOLD YOU I'D BELIEVED
I'D FOUND A FRIEND IN AL.

681
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:33,801
AS I NOW LOOK BACK,

682
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:36,501
AL NOT ONLY PRESIDED
THE SALE,

683
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,167
HE FACILITATED
MY INVOLVEMENT
AT EVERY TURN.

684
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,834
WELL, I SUPPOSE
A COMMUNITY SUCH AS THIS

685
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:45,501
ATTRACTS A CERTAIN
KIND OF MAN.

686
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:50,501
I'VE MENTIONED TO YOU
EXCHANGING HELLOS

687
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,968
WITH WILD BILL HICKOK
IN THE HOTEL HALLWAY?

688
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:56,033
YES, YOU SAID HE SEEMED
VERY FRIENDLY.

689
00:39:56,033 --> 00:39:59,434
VERY FRIENDLY.
IN THE HALLWAY AND ON
THE STAIRS.

690
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:03,367
DO YOU SUPPOSE
WE MIGHT ENLIST HIM
TO OUR CAUSE?

691
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:07,200
DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S
THE SORT OF THING HE DOES?

692
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,968
FOR A FEE, A PERCENTAGE
OF THE MONIES RECOVERED,

693
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:13,601
I'D SAY THAT'S
EXACTLY HIS LINE.

694
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:15,601
HMM.

695
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:19,601
I MAY WELL INCLUDE
THE NAME OF AL SWEARENGEN

696
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:21,334
WHEN WILD BILL
AND I CONFER.

697
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:24,567
Sol:
THIS CAMP IS
A GOING CONCERN.

698
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:26,534
WE COULD SECURE
OUR FUTURES HERE.

699
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:29,067
- HARDWARE COULD
JUST BE A START.
- CAMP NEEDS A BANK.

700
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:32,000
CAMP ALSO NEEDS A BANK
IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

701
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,667
SETH.

702
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,834
IF YOU SEE ALL
THESE POSSIBILITIES

703
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,934
WHY GET SIDETRACKED
BY THAT SALOON-KEEPER?

704
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:41,767
WE JUST WANNA
BUY HIS LOT.

705
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,634
WHAT ABOUT WHAT
HE CALLED YOU?

706
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:45,567
I BEEN CALLED
WORSE BY BETTER.

707
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:50,567
GET IT IN WRITING
FROM THAT SON
OF A BITCH.

708
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,601
WE BUY THE OTHER HALF
IN OCTOBER.

709
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:55,501
- JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

710

- EVENING.
- EVENING.

712
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,767
BILL AND ME DIDN'T
MAKE IT TO YOUR TENT TODAY.

713
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,934
TOMORROW'S ANOTHER DAY.

714
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:14,234
PROSPECT.

715
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:18,000
HIS EXPRESS PURPOSE
COMING TO THIS CAMP.

716
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,234
MAKE A STAKE
FOR HIS NEW WIFE.

717
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,834
HIS IDEA.

718
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:27,634
DON'T SUGGEST
BUYING A SHOVEL
OR A SIFTING CRADLE.

719
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:28,834
HUH-UH.

720
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:30,701
( flatulence )

721
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:33,968
AH, UH-OH.
AH.

722
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:36,767
ANYWAYS,
HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

723
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,667
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET,
BULLOCK?

724
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,434
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

725
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:45,334
YOU GOT SOME
OF BILL'S QUALITIES

726
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:47,801
 <i>BUT THEN YOU GOT</i>
 <i>SOMETHING HE'S MISSING.</i>

727
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:51,501
GET ALONG WITH PEOPLE,
TURN A DOLLAR, 

728
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,734
LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF.

729
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:56,734
HE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

730
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:58,667
 <i>YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?</i>

731
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:01,801
I LIKE TO KNOW YOUR SECRET

732
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:03,534
SO'S THEN I CAN TELL IT
TO BILL.

733
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:05,968
I DON'T KNOW
ANY SECRETS.

734
00:42:05,968 --> 00:42:07,601
DON'T TELL ME
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

735
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:10,200
FIND OCCASION
AND TELL HIM YOURSELF.

736
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,801
HE LIKES YOU.

737
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:15,367
JUST DON'T
WAIT TOO LONG.

738
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,701

OH, OH.

801
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,901
HE SCARED ME,
CHARLIE.

802
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:08,634
I AIN'T BEEN SCARED
LIKE THAT

803
00:46:08,634 --> 00:46:11,133
SINCE I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL.

804
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:12,901
OH.

805
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:14,834
OH, JESUS.

00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:42,434
IS DOC COCHRAN'S OFFICE.

810
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:46,801
IF THAT LIMEY COCKSUCKER
COMES FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL,

811
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:50,834
I GOT HIM TRIANGULATED.

812
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,334
IF HE COMES FROM
THAT WAY I GOT HIM,

813
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:56,033
AND IF HE COMES
FROM THAT WAY...

814
00:46:56,033 --> 00:46:57,968

HERE I GO.
REVENGE FOR MY
FUCKING BROTHER.

818
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:19,367
THE MAN'S GUN NEVER LEFT
HIS HOLSTER, MR. HICKOK.

819
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:20,868

FOR HIS GUN.

I GUESS HE DID
MEAN YOU HARM.

825
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:48,100
YOU'RE HALF FUCKING
BLIND, AIN'T YOU?

826
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,634
SOMETIMES IT'S
A FUCKING BLESSING.

ABOUT THE WHORES.

833
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:47,133
NO.

834
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:49,801
YOU KNOW I'LL COME
THROUGH YOU IF I HAVE TO.

835
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:53,534
LET ME REMIND YOU
OF SOMETHING, DAN.

836
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:55,634
IF YOU KILL ME...

837
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:01,667
 <i>THEN YOU ARE UP TO YOUR</i>
 <i>ELBOWS IN SNATCHES,</i>

838
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:05,000
 <i>JUST LIKE YOU WERE BEFORE</i>
 <i>I CAME TO THIS DAMN CAMP.</i>

839
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,167
TAKING CARE OF 'EM.

840
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:09,968
NURSING 'EM,
DAY IN, DAY OUT.

841
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:13,300
 <i>TAKING HEAT FROM AL</i>
 <i>EVERY TIME ONE OF 'EM'S</i>
 <i>POORLY.</i>

842
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,000
UP TO YOUR ELBOWS.

843
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,934
BETWEEN THAT
AND A SLIT THROAT

844
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:20,701
THAT AL WILL GIVE ME
IF I LEAVE THAT CHILD ALIVE,

845
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:22,968
I THINK YOU KNOW WHICH ONE
I'M GONNA CHOOSE.

846
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:28,100
YOU JUST GO AHEAD
AND DO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA
DO 'CAUSE I'M NOT MOVING.

847
00:50:32,067 --> 00:50:34,000
JESUS CHRIST.

848
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,300
YOU'RE PITTING ME
AGAINST AL.

849
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,801
SO THE FUCK BE IT.

850
00:50:45,534 --> 00:50:48,667
WELL, I AIN'T
GOING IT ALONE.

851
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:51,367
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME
TO MAKE THE CASE.

852
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,434
JESUS CHRIST.

853
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,767
JESUS CHRIST.
HAVE WE BEEN ASLEEP
AT THE SWITCH?

854
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:08,000
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- WHY'S HE GOT HIS ARM
ON THE DOC?

855
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,133
YOU WITH THAT UGLY FUCKER
OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL?

856
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:12,834
( whispers )
YES.  YES, I AM.

857
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:19,033
I'D RATHER BE LUCKY
THAN SMART.

858
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,501
WORD FOR WORD
WHAT THE HARDWARE GUY SAID.

859
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:27,167
- THE HARDWARE GUY?
- THE HARDWARE GUY.

860
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,267
DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
THE HARDWARE GUY WAS STANDING
NEXT TO HICKOK?

861
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:31,934
THE HARDWARE GUY SAID
SOMETHING LIKE,

862
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:33,801
"HICKOK'S RIGHT.
HE WAS GOING FOR HIS GUN.

863
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:35,934
- I SAW HIM
GOING FOR IT."
- SOMETHING LIKE.

864
00:51:35,934 --> 00:51:38,067
MY TOOTH WAS PAINING ME
SOMETHING AWFUL,

865
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:40,267
BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT
WAS THE GIST OF IT.

866
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:42,734
GET SOME DOPE
FROM JOHNNY.

867
00:51:42,734 --> 00:51:45,167
Man:
 <i>THANKS AN AWFUL LOT,</i>
 <i>MR. SWEARENGEN.</i>

868
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,033
 <i>MY TOOTH'S ABOUT</i>
 <i>BROUGHT ME TO MY KNEES.</i>

869
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:51,601
TELL ME ONE THING.

870
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:55,167
WHEN THAT IDIOT MADE
HIS MOVE, DID HE TIP IT?

871
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:57,467
TOM DIDN'T
SAY BOO, AL.

872
00:51:57,467 --> 00:51:59,801
HICKOK MUST'VE
JUST SMELLED HIM.

873
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:03,601
AL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.

874
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:05,667
WHAT?

875
00:52:06,868 --> 00:52:09,601
LUNATIC THAT
RUNS WITH HICKOK

876
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:12,534
JUST ABSCONDED
WITH THAT CHILD.

877
00:52:12,534 --> 00:52:14,634
MUST BE UNDER
HIS PROTECTION.

878
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:24,567
COME HERE.

879
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:38,133
YOU'RE SURE THAT GIRL DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE?

880
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:42,968
AL, I'M CONFIDENT THAT GIRL
DON'T KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE.

881
00:52:42,968 --> 00:52:45,300
BUT NO, I CAN'T GUARANTEE
THAT TO A MORE CERTAINTY.

882
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,934
I KNOW YOU GOT
YOUR WHOLE OPERATION HERE

883
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:51,167

00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:01,467
 <i>SO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?</i>

888
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:04,567
YOU WANT ME
TO JUST STAY OUTTA CAMP
UNTIL YOU DEAL WITH ALL THIS?

889
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:06,367
 <i>WHY DON'T I DO THAT, AL?</i>

890
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:09,601
HOW 'BOUT YOU HAVE JOHNNY

HEY AL, THINK I GOT TIME
