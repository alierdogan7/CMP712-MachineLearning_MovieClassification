1
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,160
Think he means it this time?

2
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:01,283
We'll see.

3
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,535
Hold your fire!

4
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:54,595
- After him before he starts the war again.
- Noche, Hondo.

5
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,222
Mr Weddle, maybe you can
get your name in the papers.

6
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:03,648
(gunshot)

7
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,985
(gunshots continue)

8
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:12,114
- Massai.
- Get back where you belong.

9
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:16,531
You saw the peace pipe
in Geronimo's hands.

10
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,870
He does not speak for me.
I remember others who surrendered.

11
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:24,879
Shipped off like cattlle to a faraway place
called Florida, never to return.

12
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,129
- But at least you would be alive, Massai.
- You call that life?

13
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:32,964
If an Apache cannot live where
his forefathers did, he is already dead.

14
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:35,936
- Now get back where you belong!
- (gunshots)

15
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:54,530
Stay down.

16
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,157
Firing stops, they are close by.

17
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,845
Put that away.

18
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,265
You want us to kill you,
don't you, Massai?

19
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:18,232
Out here in front of
all your bloodthirsty brethren,

20
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,736
so they can sing your praises
and start another war in your honour.

21
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:29,117
That'd be a sweet death,
wouldn't it, Massai?

22
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,653
A warrior's death.

23
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,709
But you're not a warrior any more.

24
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:40,080
You're just a whipped injun,

25
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:42,671
and nobody sings about handcuffs.

26
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:47,552
Take him along, Hondo.

27
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:06,735
"..you will carry out the following orders:

28
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,195
inasmuch as Geronimo
has led his warriors

29
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:13,031
off the reservation for the third time,
causing much bloodshed,

30
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:17,000
it is directed by General Niles
that Geronimo and said warriors

31
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,456
be transported to Fort Marion, Florida,

32
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:22,878
on this day, April  4th 1886".

33
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:38,186
Why don't you let us die with them?

34
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,357
Nobody's going to die.
Florida's not the moon.

35
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,191
For an Apache it is the same as dying.

36
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:47,779
Cheer up, Santos.
With Geronimo gone, you'll be chief.

37
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,907
Chief!

38
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:51,951
To old men and boys.

39
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,327
22, 3...

40
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:59,042
They are thirsty. But they will not
take water from a soldier.

41
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,968
All right, Nalinle, go ahead.

42
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,058
47...

43
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:09,759
Don't worry, Santos.

44
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:13,100
Maybe she has got her cap set for Massai,

45
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:17,528
but any young buck'd pay a big price
to marry somethin' like that.

46
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:21,024
Enough to keep you in firewater
the rest of your life.

47
00:06:22,076 --> 00:06:25,410
- It's a great day, Sieber.
- Yeah, i'm gonna kinda miss em.

48
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,789
A man knew he had a job to do
when them bucks were around.

49
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:48,054
What'd you give him?

50
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:50,395
He's got a knife!

51
00:06:56,364 --> 00:07:00,196
I knew Geronimo and Chochise
when they were that buck's age.

52
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:04,704
There's another one of the same breed.
A real bronco Apache.

53
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:19,074
Leave it alone.

54
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:21,826
Take it easy.
We're just stoppin for water.

55
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:24,413
We'll tell you when we get to Florida.

56
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:29,833
- These men want pictures for the paper.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,457
- What are the blinds down for?
- Safety measure.

58
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:35,963
They have no idea what sort of world
there is outside the windows.

59
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:38,589
Even Apaches are scared of the unknown.

60
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:41,762
You shoulda seen em when
they heard the racket in St Louis.

61
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,853
L'd be scared, 2,000 miles from home.

62
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,066
- Which one's Geronimo?
- Here, right over here.

63
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,236
The last fighting chief of the West,
but we cut him down to size.

64
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,034
- What's he in irons for?
- The last one to surrender.

65
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,073
- OK, let's shoot the pair.
- Oh, wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

66
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:03,544
Bettler cover up these irons for the picture,
or we'll have some old ladies screaming.

67
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,496
Hold it.

68
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,622
Take it easy, boys. Take it easy.

69
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,249
You'd bettler open one of those windows.

70
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:18,516
- Everybody off.
- That's all, boys.

71
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:21,135
- We have time for one more quick one.
- I'm sorry.

72
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,763
- Just Geronimo and you.
- Me and Gero...

73
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,765
Oh, well.

74
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,811
Up. Up.

75
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:32,314
- Can i say you captured him, Mr Weedle?
- Weddle's the name.

76
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:35,321
Yes. Yes, you can say i done my duty.

77
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:40,663
- All aboard!
- All right, boys, let's go.

78
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:42,833
If you leave that way, it'll be quicker.

79
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:47,042
All right, come on. Speed it up
before this thing starts movin'.

80
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,410
(bell ringing)

81
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,427
Fire! Fire!

82
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:09,364
Get your evenin paper! Get your Courier!

83
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,786
Get your evenin paper!
Get your news here!

84
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,581
Get your evenin Courier!
Get your evenin paper!

85
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:17,705
Get your news right here!

86
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,879
Pardon.

87
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:24,376
(boy) Get your news!
Get your evenin paper...

88
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:32,938
Hey, what's the idea? Put that back.

89
00:12:33,064 --> 00:12:35,104
There must be a big fire.

90
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,761
(speaking in Chinese)

91
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:12,931
Ah, good evening.

92
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,327
Good evening.

93
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:35,296
Good evening.

94
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,517
(lively piano)

95
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,575
(music continues)

96
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,416
(music stops)

97
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,672
See and hear the wonder of the age, folks.

98
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,921
We also have organs, wind
and string instruments. This way.

99
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:22,590
Follow the leader. This way.
Follow the leader, folks.

100
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:43,324
- What's he doin' here?
- He's scared o' that littlle muttl.

101
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,781
Sic him, Rover. Tear him up!

102
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,957
Hey, look at those moccasins.

103
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:50,162
- Are you an indian?
- Sure he's an lndian.

104
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:53,583
- Where you from, Sittlin' Bull?
- That's Rain-in-the-Face!

105
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:57,798
- He wants to go back to the reservation.
- What's the fuss about? What'd he do?

106
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,137
That littlle dog too much for you?

107
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,552
- Hey, he's got handcuffs on.
- Sic him, Rover. Tear him up!

108
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,477
Come on!

109
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,859
(whistle)

110
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,639
(whistle)

111
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:46,268
(woman screams)

112
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,606
Police! Police! Police!

113
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,123
(door opens)

114
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:29,673
Would you kill a brother?

115
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,513
- What tribe are you?
- Cherokee.

116
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:40,102
Is this the land of the Cherokee nation?

117
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,688
Yes, it is called Oklahoma Territory.

118
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,777
- What tribe are you?
- Apache.

119
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,114
Apache. The Apache country is far away.

120
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:57,834
But we can talk in the house.

121
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,044
I have seen the house.
lt is a white man's house.

122
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:03,497
It is my house.

123
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,148
It's all right. He will soon see
that we are friends. Get some food.

124
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:33,037
I understand. You killed
the white man and took his house.

125
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:36,581
Cherokees and white men live
side by side. There is no difference.

126
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,332
(cuckoo clock chimes)

127
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:43,289
You see? We even keep the same bird.

128
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:46,427
If the Cherokee is like the white man,
he is Massai's enemy.

129
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:49,888
- I am the enemy of no man.
- Then the Cherokee is a woman!

130
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:53,350
I am no woman. My people have
fought the white men many times,

131
00:18:53,478 --> 00:18:56,848
but were always driven West -
first from a place called Carolina,

132
00:18:56,982 --> 00:19:00,316
then to the land of the Tennessee
and then at last to Oklahoma.

133
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:02,900
But here our chiefs grew wise.

134
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:05,948
They did not fight and they did not run.

135
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:10,537
- Neither does the turtle.
- Are you afraid of the turtle?

136
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,995
Then put your knife away.

137
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:17,500
Eat.

138
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:20,711
You needn't be afraid of the food.

139
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,593
Your feet are cold and bleeding.

140
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:33,012
- Heat some water.
- You will have to fill the bucket.

141
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:39,687
You have a woman and...
yet you carry the water?

142
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:42,573
Some of the white man's ways are hard.

143
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:36,957
Nobody, not even an Apache,
could open that window quietly.

144
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:40,959
- I must get back to my people.
- There could be a life for you here.

145
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:44,512
On the reservation there's nothing,
even if you can get there.

146
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:47,014
I will get there.

147
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:49,184
Then take this.

148
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:54,147
I have food.

149
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:59,103
So i see.
But this is seed corn of Tahlequah.

150
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,613
If you are wise, you will plant it, not eat it.

151
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:05,575
- Apaches are warriors, not farmers.
- You've seen the world of the white man.

152
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:09,324
Their numbers are like leaves of the trees.
Has it taught you nothing?

153
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,455
The warrior's day is over. Once
we Cherokees were like the Apaches.

154
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:18,802
We feasted when the hunting was good.
We starved when it was bad.

155
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,634
But the white man
ate the whole year round

156
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:24,719
because he raised his own food.

157
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:29,313
We found we could live with
the white man only if we lived like him.

158
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,731
You can do the same

159
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,277
with the corn of Tahlequah,
and your people, too.

160
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,287
At least leave by the door,
not the window.

161
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:05,415
Ain't ya hungry enough?

162
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:09,294
We're gonna finish this road now,
not next year.

163
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:13,967
I'm sick and tired o joltin my eyeteeth
loose every time l go to town.

164
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:20,299
From now on, l'm gonna ride soft
and easy right over your achin backs.

165
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:23,888
(Weddle) Now lay into it or you don't eat!

166
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:26,811
Not one single, solitary bean.

167
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:58,599
I am told that soon i will be
made corporal. It is an honour.

168
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,563
I know you have worked
very hard, Hondo.

169
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,097
You keep your buttlons very shiny.

170
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,437
To be made corporal
also means greater wealth.

171
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,857
A girl of marriageable age
should think about this.

172
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,621
It will soon be dark.

173
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:23,451
If you are late back to the fort,
you might not be promoted.

174
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:34,888
For your father.

175
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,395
Goodbye, Nalinle.

176
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:44,106
Goodbye.

177
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:54,782
- Did you have kind words for him?
- I obeyed your wishes, Father.

178
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:58,164
Good. There are only
a few young men left.

179
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:02,164
Even a hawk is an eagle among crows.

180
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:06,005
Did he...?

181
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,844
Yes.

182
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:31,403
- Massai!
- (Santos) What are you saying?

183
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:34,248
Massai was carried off
on the train with Geronimo.

184
00:25:34,374 --> 00:25:37,125
She is right, Santos.
I am back with my people.

185
00:25:37,252 --> 00:25:40,703
This cannot be.
No man could do this thing.

186
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,333
Only Massai.

187
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:47,543
- If this is true, the soldiers follow you.
- No, nor will they find me till i am ready.

188
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,345
Bring cups. We will do
honour to this miracle.

189
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,887
I saw Nalinle with Hondo,
who wears the soldiers coat.

190
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:59,972
I saw Hondo walking in the village
and no one spit when he passed by.

191
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,897
I have come back just in time.

192
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,901
There is no pride left in our people.

193
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:08,156
Pride is a warrior's word.

194
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:17,086
I have seen much, Santos. And i tell you
pride is not only a warrior's word.

195
00:26:17,212 --> 00:26:20,546
We can look the white man in the eye
and meet him on his own ground.

196
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:23,759
- In peace?
- A warrior's peace, between equals.

197
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:27,670
You've heard of the Cherokees. They walk
in peace and hold their heads high,

198
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:30,132
and work for themselves,
not the white man.

199
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,889
- You have seen this?
- With my own eyes.

200
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:35,726
Here is the secret of
their pride and their wealth.

201
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:39,309
Here is the seed of a new life for our tribe.

202
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:41,437
The corn of Tahlequah.

203
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:45,190
I ask you, Santos, call the young men
together that l may speak to them.

204
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:49,276
There are no young men here.
Even the young are old now.

205
00:26:49,414 --> 00:26:52,997
But will they not say that
growing corn is woman's work?

206
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:56,827
I am a warrior. What i do
can never be woman's work.

207
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:01,295
And what Cherokees do,
Apaches can do bettler.

208
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:03,883
The young men will follow me.

209
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,719
A rabbit like Hondo,
we will change all that.

210
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:13,143
Squaws are for men.

211
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:16,144
Such thoughts come
too fast for an old man.

212
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:22,155
You are weary, and the young men
are out working on the road.

213
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:25,237
Sleep now. Sleep, Massai.

214
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:27,576
I am weary.

215
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:31,288
And it's been long
since i drank aguardiente...

216
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,874
and long since i closed both eyes.

217
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:42,175
You can close both eyes here.

218
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,845
Tell me, does Mr Weddle pay
for the work on the road?

219
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:50,891
- (Santos) Except when he is angry.
- And he is always angry.

220
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:56,231
It is hard to be a man of peace.

221
00:27:57,112 --> 00:27:59,983
It would be so pleasant to kill Mr Weddle.

222
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:12,748
Our people have been dead.
Massai will make them live again.

223
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,463
A young girl thinks with her heart
and not with her head.

224
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:20,507
I say his words are smoke
to cloud an old man's eyes.

225
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:24,007
Smoke to make a sack of corn
seem the price of a squaw.

226
00:28:24,142 --> 00:28:27,641
That is not Santos talking,
it is the aguardiente.

227
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:32,522
Where are you going?

228
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:37,444
There is wisdom in the stars.

229
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:41,198
And i need much wisdom.

230
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:04,288
All right, take him out.

231
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:10,080
I thought you were my people.
Santos has the heart of a snake.

232
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:14,214
And someday i will kill you like a snake,
and your daughter too.

233
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,513
I thought you said you delivered every
single young buck to Florida, Mr Weddle?

234
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:06,024
Maybe that Massai out in the calaboose
is somebody else with the same name.

235
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:09,188
Everybody knows you never
make mistakes, Sieber.

236
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:11,362
I'm only a common mortal.

237
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:15,109
It was a mistake, was it?
A clerical one, i suppose?

238
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:24,251
Look.

239
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:27,751
It is corn, corn from far away.

240
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:30,339
What do you mean, bustin in here?

241
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,257
Massai brought it back
from the land of the Cherokees.

242
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,217
He said they are a great people.

243
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,186
They raise corn
and live in peace with the white man.

244
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:40,269
He said Apaches can do the same.

245
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:44,609
- Massai said this?
- Yes.

246
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,894
Good thing Santos didn't fall for it.

247
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,656
My father is blind, blind with aguardiente.
You made him that way.

248
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,778
- Get outtla here!
- Shut up, Weddle.

249
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,244
Santos has forgottlen how to hope,
like all our people.

250
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,416
Massai can teach us to hope again.

251
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,333
And you want us to let him go.
is that right?

252
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,172
- Yes.
- Well...

253
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,800
- I'll let you know.
- You do not believe me.

254
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,472
I'll think about it.

255
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:31,447
Do you think it could possibly be true?

256
00:32:31,578 --> 00:32:34,116
No Apache ever became a farmer yet.

257
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:37,582
Oh, them's my sentiments exactly.

258
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:43,546
But if just one Apache tries it...
what have we got to lose?

259
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:47,293
Our scalps, likely.
These young bucks are growin up fast.

260
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:49,801
Give em a leader like Massai
an watch out.

261
00:32:49,931 --> 00:32:51,924
Massai isn't a chief.

262
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:56,223
He just sneaked across half of the USA.
They're bound to follow a man like that.

263
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:59,689
He's the last buck on earth
to make a successful farmer.

264
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:02,605
Right now he hates everybody,
and when an Apache hates,

265
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:05,193
he hates high, wide and handsome.

266
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:08,364
Well, all right.

267
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:11,284
Back to Florida.

268
00:33:11,413 --> 00:33:14,533
That's your job, Weddle.
I've got a couple of your murderers

269
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,790
eatin' their heads off in my guardhouse.

270
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,920
- Take them along, too.
- The supply train comes next week.

271
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:22,965
Well, take 'em up to Holbrook.
Put 'em on the mainline.

272
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:25,500
Do you think you can find Holbrook?

273
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:29,220
And we don't want
any "clerical errors" this time.

274
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,079
Lace it a littlle?

275
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:00,378
When.

276
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:03,593
I was beginning to think
you forgot the word.

277
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:08,766
Why'd that lousy indian
have to turn up to plague me?

278
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:13,104
He's sure been a thorn in your side.
And trust Sieber to make the most of it.

279
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:17,181
All i get's insults.
No expense money outtla this.

280
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:19,774
I wish he'd try to escape just once more.

281
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:22,111
You bettler just settlle for that drink.

282
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,444
No buck wearin leg irons
is gonna even try to escape.

283
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:29,784
Hey.

284
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:32,407
Hey, what about Jackrabbit Hill?

285
00:34:32,543 --> 00:34:35,213
This team can't haul
four prisoners up that grade.

286
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:38,375
- Meanin what?
- Meanin they'll have to get out and walk.

287
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:42,755
- And they can't do that with leg irons on.
- Glory be! They sure can't.

288
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:45,972
Any fool lndian'd know
that's his chance to run.

289
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,092
Try to run for it.

290
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:51,430
To make it look right,
we'll have to finish 'em all off.

291
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:55,562
Mr Weddle, you'll get
your name in the papers yet.

292
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:10,823
Whoa!

293
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,000
Everybody out!

294
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:18,003
Now, you lazy bucks,
you're gonna get some exercise.

295
00:35:18,135 --> 00:35:22,596
Come on, move along. Everybody out.
You heard. Move along. Come on.

296
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:05,431
Sure'll be nice to get to town.

297
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:11,818
I wonder if... i wonder if Sadie's
still runnin' that place down by the wash.

298
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:16,938
Sure. Holbrook wouldn't be
Holbrook without Sadie.

299
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:04,701
Where will we go?
The soldiers will be after us now.

300
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:08,998
Go where you will. Massai does not walk
the warpath with thieves and murderers.

301
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,215
- Massai saved us. We are his friends.
- I have no friends.

302
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:15,344
Geronimo and all the true Apaches
are gone. I fight alone.

303
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:17,843
Go. Go!

304
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:26,774
You will live, Mr Weddle.
Long enough to tell them who they fight.

305
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:08,733
- Maybe it's just some hunter.
- A drunken injun playin Fourth of July.

306
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:11,188
- Take a look, Joe.
- You take a look.

307
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,349
No, Joe, don't shoot or we're goners.

308
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,040
Telegraph lines
have been cut for two days.

309
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,215
I get crazy reports from every
fool rancher who ever saw an indian.

310
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:08,299
How many bucks are missing?

311
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:11,796
Santos says none of them are.
Got the scouts out checkin.

312
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:14,766
Who can be doing this?
Renegades from the mountains?

313
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:16,932
I got a verified report right here.

314
00:39:17,062 --> 00:39:19,469
"Cattlle stampeded at Willow Springs".

315
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:23,022
"Railroad bridge destroyed
30 miles away."

316
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,903
Somebody knows
how to hit us where it hurts.

317
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:50,260
Sergeant of the guard!
Sergeant of the guard!

318
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,349
- Get the surgeon.
- Shut up.

319
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:04,149
Do you think i want
the whole fort to see me this way?

320
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,071
Get the surgeon!

321
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:32,264
Weddle! What happened?

322
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:35,643
Massai.

323
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,242
Surgeon!

324
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,740
(cavalry charge)

325
00:41:10,393 --> 00:41:12,433
Fire! Fire!

326
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:18,307
- Move out to the right. You, to the left.
- Every man on this post, get a bucket!

327
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:25,275
Sergeant, get the powder
outtla that building!

328
00:41:43,846 --> 00:41:46,385
More water!

329
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:15,083
Weddle is dead. lt's Massai!

330
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:18,672
No.

331
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:26,513
Massai is back. l'm a dead man.

332
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:39,193
Don't worry, Santos. You will live
a littlle longer, as Mr Weddle lived.

333
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:43,369
You will have time to think
of your daughter, and she of you.

334
00:42:55,675 --> 00:42:58,000
Not so much as a busted twig.

335
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:01,256
She knows i'll follow. She'll leave a sign.

336
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:03,429
Unless he's killed her.

337
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:05,598
Anyway, no use trackin blind.

338
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,560
We'll move at sunup.

339
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:28,039
(gunshot)

340
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:00,035
Step where l step.

341
00:44:00,162 --> 00:44:04,076
lf you leave one track for
the soldiers to see, you die before l die.

342
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:56,841
Not too much.
I cannot stop for a sick woman.

343
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:04,268
You go now to kill my father?

344
00:45:10,697 --> 00:45:12,524
You cannot reach the water.

345
00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:15,694
Without you to sell,
Santos cannot reach the aguardiente.

346
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:18,497
It is worse than death.

347
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:51,364
(train whistle)

348
00:45:51,491 --> 00:45:53,531
That's all of it.

349
00:46:57,522 --> 00:46:59,561
Come. We go.

350
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,030
Still only one horse.

351
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:50,325
It's mighty tired.

352
00:48:20,654 --> 00:48:22,694
Build a fire.

353
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:30,654
I am weak.

354
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,246
We have not eaten in two days.

355
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,917
I do not have Massai's strength.

356
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,585
Build a fire!

357
00:48:46,766 --> 00:48:49,091
Is it in your mind to kill me now?

358
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:55,977
I did not betray you, Massai.

359
00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:00,688
The day Geronimo surrendered,
you wanted to die.

360
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:05,780
I wanted to die with you.
It would have been a great honour.

361
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,280
You came back from far away.

362
00:49:12,794 --> 00:49:16,958
Weary from a journey that
no warrior had ever made before,

363
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,842
but not too weary to think of your people.

364
00:49:19,968 --> 00:49:23,587
And i knew there had
never been a chief like Massai.

365
00:49:23,723 --> 00:49:26,392
You looked at me and i was proud.

366
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:30,306
And when the soldiers took you,
I pleaded for you.

367
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:34,853
My father wronged you.

368
00:49:34,985 --> 00:49:37,108
Many men have wronged you,

369
00:49:37,237 --> 00:49:40,772
but now you make yourself
worse than they are.

370
00:49:40,908 --> 00:49:43,743
Now there is nothing in you but hate.

371
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:47,950
You fight only for yourself.
You kill only for yourself.

372
00:49:48,082 --> 00:49:51,534
You're like a dying wolf,
biting at its own wounds.

373
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:00,050
Shoot...

374
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:03,880
if it will make you braver
and stronger to kill a woman.

375
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:56,483
She's still alive. There's her tracks.

376
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,698
Keep me covered.

377
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:28,981
Rode off that way.

378
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:33,238
- The horse carried double?
- Can't tell. The ground's too hard.

379
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,148
Can't follow "em without makin" noise.

380
00:51:37,285 --> 00:51:39,324
Best to wait here.

381
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,988
Massai might not come back.

382
00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:45,580
The brush beds in there
ain't been slept on.

383
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:47,953
He wouldn't leave without tyin' her.

384
00:51:48,088 --> 00:51:50,128
Sure he can't trust her?

385
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:53,633
I'm sure.

386
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:58,139
You sound like a bridegroom talkin.
All the same, we'll have a look around.

387
00:51:58,266 --> 00:52:01,267
All right, scattler out.
Get rid of them horses.

388
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,586
Sieber and the soldiers.

389
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:38,931
Stay.

390
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:54,152
(gunshot)

391
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:57,997
(gunshot)

392
00:52:58,123 --> 00:52:59,617
(gunshot)

393
00:53:05,756 --> 00:53:07,583
Get the horse!

394
00:53:12,096 --> 00:53:14,136
Come.

395
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:27,439
It was a very small rabbit.

396
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:32,198
I killed the rabbit. It's for me to decide
whether it was large or small.

397
00:53:37,249 --> 00:53:39,206
Why do you look at me?

398
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:43,582
I could feel. lt was like
when you aimed the gun at my back.

399
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:47,048
You talk like a child.
There is no gun in my hands now.

400
00:53:47,176 --> 00:53:49,632
There is a gun in Massai's mind.

401
00:53:54,726 --> 00:53:57,182
Why did you warn me about the soldiers?

402
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:03,227
- Why did you warn me?!
- Massai must know.

403
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:11,949
Where are you going?

404
00:54:13,997 --> 00:54:16,619
Will you be gone long?

405
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,748
Massai does not have to answer.
I know what is in his mind.

406
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,750
This time he will not come back at all.

407
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:27,720
- What are you doing?
- I am going with you.

408
00:54:27,846 --> 00:54:29,388
No!

409
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,701
Do you want to die? You cannot
keep up with me and i will not feed you.

410
00:54:57,837 --> 00:55:01,502
Go back to the reservation. Go anywhere!
i will not have you with me.

411
00:56:34,317 --> 00:56:36,356
Massai.

412
00:57:15,778 --> 00:57:17,818
Massai.

413
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:25,361
Why did you follow me?

414
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:29,456
I'm only a woman.

415
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:33,833
Made for bearing children,

416
00:57:33,965 --> 00:57:36,883
cooking, sewing.

417
00:57:39,388 --> 00:57:41,427
If i lost you, i was nothing.

418
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,683
- But you could have found another man.
- There is no other Massai.

419
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:59,777
You know why i had to leave you?

420
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,615
I could not bring myself to kill you...

421
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:07,415
and there was no place
in Massai's life for love.

422
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:10,497
Love is for men who can walk
without looking behind.

423
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,960
For men who can live
summer and winter in the same place.

424
00:58:15,093 --> 00:58:18,260
Every white man, every lndian,
is my enemy.

425
00:58:18,388 --> 00:58:22,386
I cannot kill them all,
and someday they will kill me.

426
00:58:24,103 --> 00:58:26,559
Then we will live until someday.

427
00:58:46,586 --> 00:58:48,875
Nalinle's.

428
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:51,377
So she up and married him
behind your back.

429
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:53,548
Too bad, Hondo.

430
00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:58,762
Might at least have
invited you to the weddin.

431
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:01,049
She'll be a widow soon.

432
00:59:01,185 --> 00:59:06,144
Don't bet on it. He wouldn't stay within
20 miles of a dead giveaway like this.

433
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,485
I'll give a cigar to anybody
who finds a track.

434
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:59,119
(laughter)

435
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:53,053
What is this?

436
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:56,053
It's nothing. A young girl's foolishness.

437
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,728
It's like the Cherokee corn.

438
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,349
I kept it. A littlle of it.

439
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:06,526
To me it was a part of Massai.

440
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,785
A young girl believes
what she wants to believe.

441
01:01:19,169 --> 01:01:21,208
Maybe it's just as well.

442
01:01:30,973 --> 01:01:33,013
You're very silent.

443
01:01:34,102 --> 01:01:37,186
There are times when words
come hard to a woman.

444
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,730
Not often.

445
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:49,527
Will you still smile if l tell you
there will be another Massai?

446
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,700
A littlle one.

447
01:01:53,957 --> 01:01:56,412
I would smile even if it were a girl.

448
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:00,251
(gunshot)

449
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:03,421
Stay down.

450
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:23,485
Only a hunter, shooting a deer.

451
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,072
Pack everything you can carry.

452
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:38,370
Is it the hunter you fear?

453
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:41,376
Not this hunter, but there will be others.

454
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:49,554
We must think now of the littlle Massai.

455
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:56,605
The mountains to the west,
we could go there.

456
01:02:58,861 --> 01:03:00,900
They are high, with much snow.

457
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:10,579
I know what you're thinking. You want
to send me back to the reservation.

458
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,873
It is the only wise thing.

459
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:18,377
You have seen them on the reservation.

460
01:03:18,507 --> 01:03:21,793
Do you want your son to grow up
to be another Santos?

461
01:03:34,983 --> 01:03:37,521
We will go - the mountains to the west.

462
01:04:13,942 --> 01:04:15,982
Massai did well.

463
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:23,699
Now there'll be something
besides water in the stew.

464
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:28,579
One rabbit in a week.

465
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:32,413
I saw a deer, but it was
too far for the bow.

466
01:04:32,546 --> 01:04:34,586
Next time i take the rifle.

467
01:04:35,424 --> 01:04:39,125
- But if the shot is heard...
- It's bettler than starving.

468
01:04:50,732 --> 01:04:53,224
Once you could fire a gun without fear,

469
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,065
because you were always on the move.

470
01:04:56,197 --> 01:04:58,818
Now l keep you tied to one place.

471
01:04:59,826 --> 01:05:04,287
I am only thinking of the littlle Massai.
This Massai is finished.

472
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:08,364
I can live a year, maybe two or three,
but in the end i must die.

473
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:22,388
But if you stopped fighting?

474
01:05:27,606 --> 01:05:29,646
I cannot stop fighting.

475
01:05:29,775 --> 01:05:32,527
I am the last real Apache left
in all the world,

476
01:05:32,653 --> 01:05:35,061
except for the littlle one to be.

477
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,941
He must not be born here.

478
01:05:37,075 --> 01:05:40,526
When i am gone, you and he
will be left alone to starve.

479
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:44,078
I know now what i must do.

480
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:47,956
When the snow melts,
I will take you back to your people.

481
01:05:51,757 --> 01:05:54,130
I will never believe that.

482
01:05:55,303 --> 01:05:58,008
Even when the soldiers took you,

483
01:05:58,139 --> 01:06:00,809
I could still dream of a life with Massai.

484
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,850
A life like the Cherokees.

485
01:06:06,732 --> 01:06:09,188
I will not stop now.

486
01:06:16,826 --> 01:06:18,866
Dreams are for fools!

487
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:25,957
Come spring, i will gather the young men

488
01:06:26,086 --> 01:06:29,253
and give my son
something to remember me for!

489
01:07:05,713 --> 01:07:07,789
Hello, Santos.

490
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:11,589
I see you're still stickin'
close to Uncle Sam.

491
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:14,045
Quit worryin'. Massai ain't after you.

492
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:19,057
He's just got you staked out on
an ant hill, that's all - a dry ant hill.

493
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:22,727
Long time between drinks, huh?

494
01:07:27,445 --> 01:07:29,485
You don't have to tell anybody.

495
01:07:35,912 --> 01:07:38,997
His Majesty, chief of all the Apaches!

496
01:07:42,044 --> 01:07:46,338
We've combed that whole country.
They're not there any more.

497
01:07:46,466 --> 01:07:48,542
Well, maybe the war's over.

498
01:07:48,676 --> 01:07:50,883
It's been prettly quiet around here, too.

499
01:07:51,012 --> 01:07:56,007
Hasn't even begun. The reservation bucks
are already makin' a legend out of him.

500
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:58,301
They haven't made a move,
and they won't.

501
01:07:58,437 --> 01:08:02,517
Well, that's only because
he hasn't called 'em out, but he will.

502
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,643
But if he can't be found...

503
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:08,063
Look, Sieber, headquarters
officially declared this a war.

504
01:08:08,198 --> 01:08:12,030
Now they'd like to officially call it off.
Forget your pride and let 'em.

505
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,616
Well, it takes two to call off a war.

506
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:20,125
He's got to be in those mountains
somewhere, and now's the time.

507
01:08:20,252 --> 01:08:24,796
Snow's meltin' and even Massai can't
navigate mud without leavin' tracks.

508
01:08:24,924 --> 01:08:27,546
You sound prettly confident.

509
01:08:27,677 --> 01:08:31,592
I've been confident, ever since
he got himself that squaw.

510
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,526
Shall i pack the rest now?

511
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:51,445
The ground is not yet firm enough.
We leave tomorrow or the next day.

512
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:57,872
Massai, look!

513
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:02,247
All the way from Cherokee land.

514
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:06,757
- It's a sign, Massai.
- Of what? That corn will grow?

515
01:09:09,723 --> 01:09:13,258
But why did it grow here?
And why did we find it now?

516
01:09:13,394 --> 01:09:17,890
I say it speaks words we were meant to
hear again: the words of the Cherokees.

517
01:09:18,024 --> 01:09:21,060
We cannot live on three stalks of corn.

518
01:09:21,194 --> 01:09:23,400
Maybe the hunting will be bettler now.

519
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,819
Maybe they've forgottlen you.

520
01:09:25,949 --> 01:09:27,989
Sieber will never forget me.

521
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:32,537
Besides, we cannot stay
too long in one place.

522
01:09:32,665 --> 01:09:36,164
Is any place safer than here,
where the corn talks to us?

523
01:09:36,294 --> 01:09:38,915
I hear no words from the corn,
but many from you.

524
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:41,253
They come too fast for me.

525
01:09:47,973 --> 01:09:51,508
I must hunt with the bow again.
I may not be back tonight.

526
01:09:54,146 --> 01:09:58,358
- You will come back?
- You know l would not leave my rifle.

527
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,741
What's the mattler?

528
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:17,162
I thought the corn might tell me
where to find a deer.

529
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:48,660
What is this?

530
01:10:50,666 --> 01:10:53,039
I'm going to plant some corn.

531
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:55,625
In that littlle scratch in the ground?

532
01:10:57,048 --> 01:10:59,753
The Cherokee corn
grew without even a scratch.

533
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:02,969
The Cherokee corn
could do anything, even talk.

534
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:12,764
See? lt is not so easy.

535
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,190
Only a woman would call it hard.

536
01:11:22,618 --> 01:11:25,287
This is stupid. There's no corn to plant.

537
01:11:30,335 --> 01:11:33,668
I stole it this morning.
The store in Gurney Springs.

538
01:11:33,797 --> 01:11:36,039
That's clear down the mountain.

539
01:11:36,174 --> 01:11:39,709
You were a fool!
Worse, you must have left tracks.

540
01:11:44,225 --> 01:11:46,264
Look. For you.

541
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:49,476
Aren't they beautiful?

542
01:13:02,226 --> 01:13:05,596
Aren't you planting it too deep?
How can it ever come up?

543
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:10,309
Have i not seen the white man's
cornfield? Don't tell me how to plant corn.

544
01:13:10,444 --> 01:13:13,895
Have you ever seen anyone
put the seed in the ground?

545
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:17,115
A squaw should work,
not ask foolish questions!

546
01:13:21,706 --> 01:13:23,331
Shoo!

547
01:13:27,045 --> 01:13:30,331
- I'm all right.
- I've been a fool to let you work.

548
01:13:30,465 --> 01:13:33,550
You rest. I'll finish the planting -
not so deep.

549
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:37,506
I can help. I want to.

550
01:13:38,516 --> 01:13:40,972
What can i do? i can't beat you.

551
01:13:41,102 --> 01:13:43,427
(pigeon coos)

552
01:13:58,913 --> 01:14:02,496
Howdy, Mr Sieber. See you're still at it.

553
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:05,995
I'll be needin' a side o bacon,
a sack o' beans,

554
01:14:06,129 --> 01:14:08,751
some flour and saleratus.

555
01:14:11,093 --> 01:14:14,545
- You takin' inventory or ain't ya?
- Yes, sir.

556
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,468
Didn't expect you back
this way so soon, Mr Sieber.

557
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,222
You must have heard
about our big lndian raid.

558
01:14:20,353 --> 01:14:23,224
Can't say as i did.
We'll have some coffee, too.

559
01:14:23,356 --> 01:14:28,696
Yes, sir. indian uprising right here. You
want some Gordon's coffee or Coulter's?

560
01:14:28,821 --> 01:14:32,653
Coulter's will be all right. Throw in
a plug o tobacco while you're at it.

561
01:14:32,783 --> 01:14:34,776
Yes, sir.

562
01:14:34,911 --> 01:14:40,250
Them savages didn't get no scalps.
No, siree.

563
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:43,497
But they sure enough lifted a pair o pants.

564
01:14:43,628 --> 01:14:46,084
Yes, sir, right from that shelf.

565
01:14:47,007 --> 01:14:50,922
I reckon you know that folks are saying
you're a littlle teched in the head.

566
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:53,093
Are you one of those folks?

567
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,511
(clears throat) Uh...

568
01:14:55,642 --> 01:14:58,477
I can make you a good price
on some spinach.

569
01:14:58,603 --> 01:15:00,845
What would i want with spinach?

570
01:15:00,981 --> 01:15:03,020
What else did these savages take?

571
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,107
Oh, it wasn't no lndian.

572
01:15:05,235 --> 01:15:07,809
Why, he just took a sack full o seed corn.

573
01:15:07,947 --> 01:15:11,814
Now, you show me a lazy buck
that's interested in seed corn.

574
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:18,165
Maybe i'll take that spinach after all.

575
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:20,913
- Son, you wanna make a dollar?
- Yes, sir.

576
01:15:24,256 --> 01:15:27,127
I want you to take
this message to the fort.

577
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:34,297
See that Colonel Beck gets it personally.

578
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:36,474
Is it all right if i go, Mr Conroy?

579
01:15:36,603 --> 01:15:38,643
Yeah, i reckon so.

580
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:42,313
Teched in the head, huh?

581
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:45,986
Maybe.

582
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:16,644
(bird screeches)

583
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:26,111
(galloping hooves)

584
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:05,886
(Nalinle) Massai?

585
01:18:19,113 --> 01:18:21,486
I'm sorry, the fire is out.

586
01:18:21,616 --> 01:18:23,656
I didn't feel well enough.

587
01:18:25,662 --> 01:18:28,747
- Is it time for the littlle... ?
- Yes, i think so.

588
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:34,498
- Did you get a deer?
- No. No, i didn't see any.

589
01:18:36,465 --> 01:18:38,505
I'm glad Massai's back.

590
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:43,295
Your hand is cold,

591
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:45,471
but you've been running.

592
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:48,807
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

593
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:54,857
It's just that i've... i've never been
so close to having a son before.

594
01:18:55,945 --> 01:18:58,483
It is very close.

595
01:18:58,615 --> 01:19:00,654
And it will be a son, i know.

596
01:19:03,954 --> 01:19:06,825
They've found us, haven't they?

597
01:19:06,957 --> 01:19:08,997
I can feel the blood.

598
01:19:10,586 --> 01:19:13,042
They are not here yet, but soon.

599
01:19:13,965 --> 01:19:16,717
They are bound to see the cornfield.

600
01:19:16,843 --> 01:19:18,883
Someday has come.

601
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:23,391
Why did you come back, Massai?

602
01:19:23,517 --> 01:19:26,435
- This is where i belong.
- Is it?

603
01:19:27,646 --> 01:19:29,805
Is this where you want to die?

604
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:35,362
Only a warrior chooses his place to die.
l am no longer a warrior.

605
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:39,777
Once before you said that,

606
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:44,204
when from the Cherokees
you brought the corn of Tahlequah.

607
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:47,498
And then you tried again, here, for me.

608
01:19:49,462 --> 01:19:54,124
But the blood l feel here,
it is still warrior's blood.

609
01:19:54,259 --> 01:19:57,176
- It wants to fight.
- Don't speak of these things now.

610
01:19:57,304 --> 01:19:59,925
- There is time for you to go.
- I will not leave you.

611
01:20:00,057 --> 01:20:04,185
Why? They will not harm me
or the littlle Massai.

612
01:20:04,645 --> 01:20:07,136
It is too late for me to get away.

613
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:11,436
Then die the warrior's death
you've always wanted.

614
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:14,440
Don't let Sieber cheat you out of it again.

615
01:20:33,134 --> 01:20:35,804
You will sing of it to the littlle Massai?

616
01:20:40,142 --> 01:20:43,143
Would you have me
sing to him of the plough?

617
01:21:49,593 --> 01:21:51,051
(yells)

618
01:21:57,226 --> 01:21:58,969
(yells)

619
01:22:24,881 --> 01:22:28,416
Get around the cornfield.
I'm goin in an' flush him out.

620
01:22:28,552 --> 01:22:31,221
Surround the cornfield!

621
01:25:21,073 --> 01:25:22,982
(baby cries)

622
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,664
Hold your fire!

623
01:26:15,758 --> 01:26:17,964
He planted that corn and made it grow,

624
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:20,549
something no Apache ever did before.

625
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,298
I wish the bucks
on the reservation could see this.

626
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:33,814
Looks like he called the war off.

627
01:26:35,112 --> 01:26:37,782
Then what are you lookin so glum about?

628
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:41,156
Gettlin' old, i guess.

629
01:26:42,203 --> 01:26:44,243
This was the only war we had,

630
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,948
and we ain't likely to find another.
