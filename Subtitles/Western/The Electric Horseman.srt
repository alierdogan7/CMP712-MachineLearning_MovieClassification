00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,077
Take it easy, we're comin'.
Shake it up, we gotta go.

2
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,113
What do you think I'm doin'? I'm pushin'
his boot and he won't even help.

3
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,437
# Whiskey river... don't run dry...

4
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,835
- All right, here.
- Thanks.

5
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,309
Hey, how about a little coffee?

6
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,280
Here you go... Can you use a little of that?

7
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,758
Put his arm in that sleeve, Leroy.

8
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,916
Got a little somethin' to go with that?

9
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,076
- Got his wires?
- Go get my wires.

10
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,715
- You said to put his arm in the sleeve.
- Button his shirt.

11
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,037
Button his shirt, put his arm
in the sleeve and get the wire.

12
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,675
- His hat. Where's his hat?
- I'm buttoning his shirt.

13
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,758
Ooh... It's pinchin' my hair.

14
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,440
Come on, let's go. Here we go, rollin'.

I'm all right. Let me go.

16
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,588
- Is he gonna make it?
- Sure. Don't he always?

17
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,470
No.

- We all should.

That's the beauty
you're ridin' in Vegas Friday.

66
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,557
He ain't gonna ride him.
Just sit on him up on the stage...

67
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,036
...and he's gonna have
little rubber booties on his hooves.

68
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,118
Leroy, you wanna sign this?
It's for that Watkins kid.

69
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,028
He drawed ol' Little Venus over
in Fairview. Let's send him some luck.

70

I don't think he's gonna need it.

71
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,469
- You stayed on worse than Little Venus.
- Ain't no worse than Little Venus.

72
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,276
The hell there ain't. Nameless was worse,
and he did eight on Nameless.

73
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,188
Well, I ain't on Nameless any more.
And I got no intention of bein'.

74
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,520
That was a little compliment there.

Fork instead of that Malibu house.

Oh, Spanish... What's the matter
with the Malibu house?

78
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,959
I don't remember your minding it so much.
You was in the water half the time...

79
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,232
...wearin' them flippers, lookin' dumb,
actin' like a damn penguin.

80
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,436

You're not on the bacon-and-bean circuit.

Livin'... better than we got a right to.

- Beats havin' a bull tap-dance on you.

85
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,670
- Leroy, get them pants pressed, will you?
- And it beats havin' your legs braided.

86
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,236
And it beats havin' a bull
use your head for a floor mat. Don't it?

Now, if there's anything you need,
just say the word.

109
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,318
We got about half a dozen
movie people here...

110
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,193

Joanna Camden just came in...

112
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,911
He'll appear on stage with Sonny Steele,
the cowboy we use in Ranch Breakfast.

113
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,395
You think he's worth coverin'?

114
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,555
Well, there's better stuff.
I mean, the cowboy's a peach of a guy...

115
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,992
...but there's just a lot of "yup"
and "shucks", and stuff like that.

116
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
He's no interview.
Better steer clear of him.

117
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,710
See you downstairs.

118
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,632
Bernie... So, they don't want us
to talk to the cowboy.

119
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,639
- Where do you wanna start?
- Where do I wanna start?!

120
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,835
Excuse me, please.

121
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,597
- Where the hell is he?
- Probably drunk in Barstow somewhere.

122
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,956
Excuse me, could you tell me
if Mr Sonny Steele has checked in yet?

123
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,438
No, he's not listed.

124
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,592
- It's an interesting watchband.
- Thank you. It's Indian.

125
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,029
- May I see it?
- Sure.

126
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,157
Oh, it's lovely.

127
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,159
Why does Ampco say absolutely
no interviews with Sonny Steele?

128
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,159
- Who told you that?
- Oh, one of the people at Ampco.

129
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,997
That don't really
mean anything, you know.

130
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,193
Sonny hasn't been himself lately.
They're a little down on him. But it's OK.

131
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,835
He's just a cowboy. Sometimes
he loses the best part of himself.

132
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,349
What is the best part of himself?

133
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,149
- You'd have to know him a long time.
- How long have <i>you</i> known him?

134
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,430
<i># Cowboys ain't easy to love</i>

135
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,028

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,550
<i># And he don't die young</i>

141
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,752
<i># He'll probably just ride away</i>

142
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,792
- Where the hell you been?
- What's he doin' in a parking lot?

143
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,639
I don't know, but he got here on time.
Come on.

144
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,032
Press conference has started and Danny
Miles has waited all day to rehearse you.

145
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,277
- Well, here you are.
- Wendell, what do I have to do?

146
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,473
Well, there's been all kind of hell to pay,
so just behave yourself.

147
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,720
Boy, you smell like a tequila factory.
Here, put these Tic Tacs in your mouth.

148
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,469
You'll never guess who I seen.
Rush, and Hawkman, and old Edgar...

149
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,388
Hey, watch it there, partner!
They all send their hellos.

150
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,159
Foggy Tate's wife Louise
gave me this handkerchief.

151
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,717
- I told you he was in Barstow.
- Whew! God, they got pretty girls here!

152
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,039
Come on. This is a serious thing to these
people. They're tryin' to buy this big bank.

153
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,958
- Hold it. What's in here?
- It's a press conference.

154
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,152
So don't tell no jokes,
don't lift up nobody's dress, OK?

155
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,590
- What do I have to say?
- Nothin', if we're lucky. Come on.

156
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,392
John, you had a question.

157
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,672
Do you anticipate opposition
to the takeover of Omnibank?

158
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,156
Just a moment.
It isn't a takeover, it's a merger.

159
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,559
- But Omnibank has always opposed...
- We think that attitude's changing.

160
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,956
We've made a generous tender offer
for the Omnibank shares.

161
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,389
We're confident they'll accept it.

162
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,433
Troy, you look like you're gonna jump
outta that seat. You have a question?

163
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,312
For Mr Broderick.

164
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,911
Bud, you've played opposite just about
every great motion-picture actress.

165
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,828
- Yes, I have.
- Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser?

166
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,319
That depends. What part of the body
are you talking about?

167
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,357
Print that. I dare you.

168
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,553
Mr Steele, why were you 45 minutes late
to the press conference?

169
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,952
Ha... Well...

170
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,798
I'd like to apologise for that.

171
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,590
I was, uh... I was givin' mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to a bottle of tequila.

172
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,556
And we lost her, too.

173
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,309
Do you in fact
eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast?

174
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,752
Well, ma'am, I eat
steak and eggs for breakfast.

175
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,997
- You were three-time...
- And Ranch Breakfast for lunch.

176
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,954
You were three-time
Worid Champion Cowboy...

177
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,798
Five.

178
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,515
Five-times Worid Champion Cowboy,
and now you're selling cereal.

179
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,870
How do you feel about that?

180
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,997
- Lady, I don't wanna tangle with you.
- Listen, we've got a time problem here.

181
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,918
You are all invited
by our chairman, Mr Hunt Sears...

182
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,556
...to a reception before the performance.
And enjoy yourselves, you hear?

183
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,114
- You got a rehearsal.
- What was that all about?

184
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,959
- I don't know. Come on.
- Rehearse what?

185
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,198
After you circle, you stop
on your mark, stage left...

186
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,630
...lean forward in the saddle,
face the audience, wave...

187
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,069
Where's the horse?

188
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,835
Bring in the damn horse.

189
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,156
Spot, please.

190
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,235
God, he's a beauty.

191
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,433
Tom, Sonny rides in circles three times,
applause, applause, applause...

192
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,348
...then stops on the mark.
Sonny, your first line is...

193
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,076
- What have you got him on?
- A little bute. And some penicillin.

194
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,709
This tendon, it ought
to be braced and bandaged.

195
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,752
- They think it don't look right.
- Uh, hello?

196
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,590
- What do you mean, they think...
- Sonny.

197
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,951
- After you stop, you say...
- Your horse is stoned.

198
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,878
How else are we gonna get him up here
with all these lights?

199
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,719
Excuse me, gentlemen!
We're trying to rehearse!

200
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,429
Sonny, your first line...

201
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,630
"Ranch Breakfast...
a champ's way to start the morning."

202
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,639
Then you look at the horse and you say
"Ain't that right, Risin' Star?"

203
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,433
"If you agree, don't say anything."

204
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,598
It's funny. It's funny. You try it.

205
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,670
"Ranch Breakfast,
a champ's way to start the morning."

206
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,519
Wonderful. But much, much bigger.

207
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,956
Much bigger. Louder.

208
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,670
"Ranch Bre..."

209
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,908
- There's more. There's more.
- I saw it.

210
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,836
That's the most discourteous thing
I ever saw in the theatre.

211
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,989
Sonny, this is Hunt Sears.
He ain't no flunky.

212
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,348
This it here?

213
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,596
You ain't in no shape
to see no Hunt Sears.

214
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,597
What I gotta do first? Jog?

215
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,874
Dual overhead camshafts, fully enclosed
drive shaft, dual disc brakes in front...

216
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,711
Each item will appear in several major
magazines during the month of July.

217
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,628
As an example of our confidence
in the success of these new fashions...

218
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,709
...Ampco will be sending these lovely
models on a one-month tour...

219
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,354
Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol.

220
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,913
Hey. How are you?

221
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,559
Well, then let's...

222
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,116
Carol's interested in commercials...

223
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,596
Hey, Sonny, I wanna get my son a horse.
What kind is best?

224
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,950
- How old is your kid?
- He's six years old.

225
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,957
Get him a short horse.

226
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,198
- Hey, Hallie Martin. We met in New York.
- Did we like each other?

227
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,551
That question about the merger -
who the hell was that guy?

228
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,071
That was Cross, the Washington bureau
of the <i>Times</i>. He's connected to Treasury.

229
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,430
- He shouldn't have been here.
- Spilt milk.

230
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,712
Sonny, here's a couple I'd
like you to meet. Mr and Mrs Phillips.

231
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,513
- Hi.
- Steve Phillips, the Million-Dollar Club.

232
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,552
Sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year.

233
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,309
- Well, the mean-question lady.
- I'm just curious.

234
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,797
- Uh, Steve Phillips, the...
- You know what curiosity did to the cat.

235
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,436
He sold a million dollars' worth
of Ranch Breakfast last year. Wholesale.

236
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,472
Are you kiddin' me? That's just fantastic.

237
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,195
- We're very proud of it.
- I'll bet you are. And I am too. Damn.

238
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,993
- I just love that...
- This is Grace Phillips.

239
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,192
I know. We met too.
Everything's going around and around.

240
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,279
- Oh, that poster is beautiful.
- It's a great gimmick. Very effective.

241
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,474
Grace, why don't you stand in front of it
with Sonny, and Steve can take a picture.

242
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,513
Why not just take a picture of Grace in
front of that picture of me and the box...

243
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,473
...with a picture of me on the box,
holding a picture of me...

244
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,149
Then you got Grace
and a whole bunch of pictures of me.

245
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,272
Sonny, you know that TV show in Denver?
We've had to make changes in your copy.

246
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,550
I bet it's shorter.

247
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,477
- In a multimedia situation...
- Mr Sears?

248
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,398
Hello, Sonny. It's about time
we finally met, isn't it?

249
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,956
- Yes, sir, it's about time.
- Everybody here know Mr Steele?

250
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,799
Like our horse?
Couldn't have a better straight man.

251
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,514
- Can I have a word with you, sir?
- Perhaps later.

252
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,110
- Beautiful animal, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, he's an amazing animal.

253
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,630
But he don't belong
in a parking lot in Las Vegas.

254
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,276
I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most
natural place in the worid for any of us.

255
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,800
Well, sir, I don't think he's feelin' so good.

256
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,115
Let's give him a drink!

257
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,993
Rising Star represents
a substantial investment.

258
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,192
You can be sure
we've entrusted his care to experts.

259
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,756
Well, I don't think
them experts are so expert.

260
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,957
Mr Steele, would you please sign this
picture for me? For my daughter Tammy.

261
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,550
Look, why don't I make an appointment
with Mr Sears's secretary...

262
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,797
Why would you put that horse
on a stage with dancing girls?

263
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,388
- Just a minute...
- I'm talkin' to <i>him</i>.

264
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,389
It sells products, Sonny.

265
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,753
You mustn't apply logic to advertising.
It'll just confound you, believe me.

266
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,917
Well, it just don't feel right to me.
It seems wrong.

267
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,157
All them lights blinkin' and winkin',
and girls...

268
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,475
Sir, I used to rodeo.

269
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,828
- And I was good at it.
- That's irrelevant.

270
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,159
To who?

271
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,999
This is a conversation
we might have some other time.

272
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,996
Would it matter?

273
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,430
What matters is that you fulfil
the requirements of your contract.

274
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,473
Which don't include your passing
judgment on corporate policy.

275
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,998
Nothin' in that contract
about me ridin' toy horses.

276
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,429
You're not in rodeo any more.

277
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,835
Actually, you're more famous now,
aren't you?

278
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,635
Your face is on millions of boxes,
on billboards all over the country...

279
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,955
...people want your autograph...

280
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,117
What I'm talking about
is that you voluntarily accepted...

281
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,152
...a highly paid, relatively simple job...

282
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,910
...that more than a handful of cowboys
would give their right arm for.

283
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,118
You're right.

284
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,674
I don't want just to be right.

285
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,555
- You want me to like it?
- It would be a factor in our relationship.

286
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,150
Mr Sears, Joanna Camden
is waiting over by the earthmover.

287
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,397
- Why don't we have a picture session?
- Excuse us, please.

288
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,636
You bet.

289
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,389
- I'm sorry, sir.
- When this is over, get rid of him.

290
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,519
- Charlotta! Hey!
- Got a quarter?

291
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,473
No, don't... don't say it.
I bet that cheque's in the mail.

292
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,797
Wendell handles all that, babe,
you know that. Come talk to me.

293
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,480
How <i>is</i> old Wendell
who can't find a stamp?

294
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,834
Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels,
please. Tall glass.

295
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,514
- The lady will take a Rob Roy.
- Orangeade. I quit.

296
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,516
What... What's the matter?
You're not born-again, are you?

297
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,793
Maybe I am.
I got me a record contract now.

298
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,673
All on my own too.
You be sure and tell Wendell Hixson <i>that</i>.

299
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,713
You sure are tough on Wendell. Not that
I blame you, cheques bein' late an' all.

300
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,594
I don't wanna talk about the cheques.
You know what I wanna talk about.

301
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,836
I want you to sign these papers.

302
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,555
You don't think I saw you tryin'
to slip out? I left three messages.

303
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,036
Well, now wait a minute.
I didn't get no messages.

304
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,629
Sonny, that judge told you
to sign the papers.

305
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,711
- Don't you wanna be divorced for real?
- Yes, I do. I just... Well, I've been busy.

306
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,515
Busy?! Doin' what? Makin' up excuses?

307
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,595
Excuses?

308
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,713
You got somebody now who sits up
all night cos you lost your keys?

309
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,478
Or you got a flat tyre?

310
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,276
Comin' home at 6am, expectin' me
to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys.

311
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,393
And cowgirls who didn't bother to look
like they hadn't been in your back seat!

312
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,239
Charlotta, yoo-hoo,
you got a mean memory.

313
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,669
- Just a couple of parties...
- A couple?!

314
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,394
That light-up suit
musta given you shock treatment!

315
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,557
I'm talkin' a <i>lot</i> of parties,
and a <i>lot</i> of back seats!

316
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,830
But for back seats, we'd never have met.

317
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,110
And I'll bet you're still doin' it.

318
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,674
Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out.

319
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,429
You're just walkin' around
to save funeral expenses.

320
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,435
You smile, babe. You get my insurance.

321
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,792
Do you know what your skeleton looks like
in them x-ray pictures? A junkyard.

322
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,832
You couldn't get through
a metal detector stark naked.

323
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,871
Give me the papers.

324
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,319
Huh?

325
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,590
Give me the papers.

326
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,160
- For real?
- Give me them.

327
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,870
You look like hell.

328
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,955
Well, you look great.

329
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,796
Hey. Would you come up to my room?

330
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,869
I can't. You just know what'd happen.

331
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,793
Yeah.

332
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,388
Besides, I got somebody
who really likes me now.

333
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,750
Well, it's not hard to do.

334
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,676
- Who's the lucky fella?
- Billy-Roy Fix.

335
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,196
Billy-Roy Fix?

336
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,276
Is that right?

337
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,077
I guess there's just somethin'
about us Western stars.

338
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,115
- <i> Mr Sonny Steele, please report</i>...
- Oop, that's me. I'm late.

339
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,796
Goodbye, darlin'.

340
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,677
Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh?

341
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,152
Well, Mr Steele.

342
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,675
After this number,
the motorcycle daredevils - God save us.

343
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,109
And then you and the horse.

344
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,838
Now, listen. You don't start those things
until I give you the cue, yes?

345
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,471
Not now.

346
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,955
Not now! Not now!

347
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,755
Open the curtain.

348
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,239
Forget the routine! Go right to the finale!

349
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,750
That was very effective.
This is no criticism, you understand...

350
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,519
...but it's too dangerous
to use that horse on a ramp.

351
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,471
He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp!

352
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,310
He wasn't even supposed to be out there
yet! He's ruined the whole concept!

353
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,232
<i># I gotta run to keep from hidin'</i>

354
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,909
<i># And I'm bound to keep on ridin'</i>

355
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,628
<i># And I got one more silver dollar</i>

356
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,716
<i># And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me</i>

357
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,437
<i># No, I ain't gonna let 'em catch</i>
<i>the midnight rider</i>

358
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,431
- What did he say?
- He was rude. He was very rude!

359
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,791
- And he wasn't concentrating.
- He must've said something to you.

360
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,629
Well, he was askin' about
the horse's tendon, and the drugs.

361
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,276
Drugs? What drugs?

362
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,912
- Well, the tranquillisers and...
- That's done all the time.

363
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,315
They tranquillise the animal
to keep it calm.

364
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,432
And the Butazolidin
they use for the... tendon.

365
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,199
Mutual Indemnity and the police.
Which do you want?

366
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,437
- Neither. I wanna keep this quiet.
- You may as well know the rest.

367
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,429
Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed
we've used steroids to muscle him up.

368
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,075
Well, are they dangerous?

369
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,036
Well, they make the horse sterile.

370
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,517
Well, temporarily. I mean, it's just
a side effect. It's not a permanent thing.

371
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,029
Do we put that on the box top,
"Temporary"?

372
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,597
- It goes away in, what, how many hours?
- Gentlemen, would you excuse us?

373
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,996
- There are drinks upstairs.
- Ah, the worid of illusion.

374
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,509
Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out.

375
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,596
Jesus...

376
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,919
We're not talking about a horse,
we're talking about a $300 million merger.

377
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,076
Omnibank will make a feast out of this.

378
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,556
If Steele talks to anyone before
he's caught, we have no merger.

379
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,955
Ampco and the horse are the same thing.

380
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,436
If we've mismanaged the horse,
we've mismanaged the corporation.

381
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,473
- Couldn't he have called the SPCA?
- What'll we say to the reporters?

382
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,398
- Tell 'em to go to bed.
- It's a little late for that.

383
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,875
And get those morons out of here.

384
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,231
- Come on, Bob.
- One drunken cowboy!

385
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,393
We have been advised
by the attorney general...

386
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,035
...that the theft of Rising Star
is grand larceny, a felony.

387
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,280
Should this prove to be a deliberate act,
a warrant will be issued for Mr Steele.

388
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,313
At this time, however, our primary concern
is the welfare of our horse.

389
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,637
What did he say to Sears?
They were really goin' at each other.

390
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,716
Hallie, give me a break, will ya?

391
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,435
- Ransom. What about ransom?
- The man's not <i>that</i> crazy.

392
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,712
He's been tossed on his head enough
times. Thought about brain damage?

393
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,072
The cowboy is a little hot-tempered.
He's emotionally disturbed, that's all.

394
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,751
Come on, Fitz. He's made a mistake
and he'll bring it back when he cools out?

395
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,474
- Oh, come on.
- Look, let me alone, will ya?

396
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,318
I don't know any answers.

397
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,238
I don't know from brain damage,
from cooling out...

398
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,239
Look, why don't you go have a sauna?
Give me some <i>good</i> news, for chrissake!

399
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,476
"Cool... out."

400
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,353
...<i>these days</i>.

401
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,552
- <i> Why'd she quit him?</i>
- <i> Who knows?</i>

402
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,398
<i>Sonny was married in Gus's living room</i>.
<i>And when that woman quit him,</i>...

403
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,829
...<i>well, you know</i>
<i>where Sonny came to cool out</i>.

404
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,918
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old</i>
<i>and strange these da</i>...

405
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,197
...<i>well, you know</i>
<i>where Sonny came to cool out</i>.

406
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,880
<i>Course, Gus is gettin' old</i>
<i>and strange these days</i>.

407
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,358
Seen Wendell?

408
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,632
No. I haven't seen nobody. They're just
runnin' round like crazy people today.

409
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,878
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit.

410
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,074
Hey, tell me somethin'. Somethin'
personal. Were you surprised he did it?

411
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,158
Who, Sonny?

412
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,829
Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. Just some
surprises are bigger than others.

413
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,236
Like he gave me this ring one day,
just like that.

414
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,749
Had old Wendell's teeth
fixed for him, too.

415
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,633
- What's your last name?
- Smitley.

416
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,320
Say, you know something?
We got a mutual friend.

417
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,796
- Oh, we do? Well, who do we know?
- Gus Atwater.

418
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,591
I know Gus. Do you know Gus?
Where do you know Gus from?

419
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,589
Oh, sure. Wait, are we talkin' about
the same Gus, from, uh, Tuba City?

420
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,475
No, not Tuba City. No, the Gus I mean
is from Mesquite, about 30 miles up here.

421
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,476
Mesquite.

422
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,035
You wanna drive?

423
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,278
Morning.

424
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,356
Hello.

425
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,799
- You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves?
- You must be a Capricorn.

426
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,712
- You got any eucalyptus leaves?
- Just tea bags.

427
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,752
- Well, I need some of them tea bags.
- How many would you like?

428
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,359
Oh, five or six dozen.

429
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,596
- Bags?
- Boxes.

430
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,838
Come on, boy. Come on, son.

431
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,270
Just a couple more times of doin' this
and you'll be breathin' just fine.

432
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,391
If <i>I</i> live.

433
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,953
- Mr Atwater?
- # Golden hills

434
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,196
# Round her head

435
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,317
# Glimmer golden hills

436
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,191
Mr Atwater?

437
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,276
You wounded?

438
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,718
- No, I'm looking for a friend of ours.
- He ain't here.

439
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,469
- But he was.
- Yep.

440
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,750
From about this high.

441
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,989
- Was he here today?
- Here today, gone tomorrow.

442
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,315
Like a flutterin' bird.

443
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,990
- Hey, hey, who are you?
- I work for television.

444
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,275
- You know television?
- Yeah. I got one.

445
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,114
Works sometimes. Comes a-flashin'.

446
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,471
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

447
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,956
- Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's.
- Leroy! Oh-ho!

448
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,550
Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell.

449
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,073
They told me you'd know
where to find him.

450
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,958
How else would I know
where you were? Huh?

451
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,795
We're real worried about him.

452
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,195
I gotta find him. I have to talk to him.

453
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,035
I can't hurt him.

454
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,596
He came here. Covered with a mist.

455
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,872
You know? Like floats atop a river?

456
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,679
And... and it grows into a cloud...

457
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,751
...and it shuts away the sun...

458
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,635
Where'd he go, Gus?

459
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,718
- No, please!
- What?! How did you find me?

460
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,513
- What are you doing?
- You're hurting me! Stop it!

461
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,073
- Who's with you?
- I'm alone.

462
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,997
- How did you find me?
- I swear to God...

463
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,429
- How did you get here?
- I drove myself.

464
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,471
How? How did you find me?

465
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,397
Gus.

466
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,591
Gus Atwater.

467
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,676
Gus?

468
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,629
Gus.

469
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,116
Can I... can I get up now?

470
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,910
Please?

471
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,315
How did you know to get to Gus?

472
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,556
I... interviewed your friends.

473
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,639
Who?

474
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,593
Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd...

475
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,317
Wait a minute, you hit my face,
you son of bitch!

476
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,075
I'm not gonna stay here.

477
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,349
What did you take the horse for?

478
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,633
You're crazy.

479
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,834
- Does anybody else know about Gus?
- No. No. And nobody knows anything...

480
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,795
Oh, <i>I'm</i> crazy? You go off with somebody
else's $12 million horse, and <i>I'm</i> crazy?!

481
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,717
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't you hit me!

482
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,796
- Did you scare that old man?
- No.

483
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,630
Does anybody else know you're here?

484
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,880
No. Nobody knows anything. I don't have
any reason to tell anybody anything.

485
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,389
Go away. Go home.

486
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,039
Well, what <i>are</i> you gonna do with him?

487
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,510
Look, just tell me why you took the horse.
You can't race him. You can't sell him.

488
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,189
And you're not gonna start
your own cereal company.

489
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,274
I mean, what the hell <i>do</i> you want?

490
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,192
Oh, can't you just answer one question?

491
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,112
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I don't usually get hit doing this, but...

492
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,754
What do you expect,
sneakin' up like some cat?

493
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,599
I tried to call, but your line was busy.

494
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,189
Do you know how worried your friends are
about you? Wendell and Leroy?

495
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,593
Isn't there something I can tell them?

496
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,678
What is this place?
Does this have special meaning to you?

497
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,474
You want information, go to the library.

498
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,311
I know what you want. It ain't answers.

499
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,274
You just want a story. Any story.
Why don't you make one up?

500
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,234
That's what you all do anyway.
You don't need me to tell you no story.

501
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,114
You ask me why I'm 45 minutes late.
You're not interested in why I'm late.

502
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,279
Just in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat
Ranch Breakfast?" Who the hell cares?

503
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,834
Honest to hell, you people
are all the same.

504
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,235
There's folks in Africa,
or some damn place...

505
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,794
...you try to take a picture of them,
they'll kill ya.

506
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,629
They figure you're takin' somethin' from
them, and you just got so much stuff...

507
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,274
...and if other people take it all
you got nothin' left.

508
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,914
Well, I don't wanna be no story.

509
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,991
- I've just retired from public life.
- Boy, have you got that wrong.

510
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,829
You rode down the Las Vegas Strip
with somebody else's $12 million horse.

511
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,270
Did you think we wouldn't notice?
You're a story all right.

512
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,595
But not yours.

513
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,759
I'm nobody's story but my own now.

514
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,396
But... Wait, wait a minute...
Where are you going?

515
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,438
Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I?

516
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,439
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Was it something I said?

517
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,428
Look, can't you just do
a working girl a favour?

518
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,950
I'm just trying to earn an honest buck,
tell an honest tale.

519
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,992
I don't want to make up
a story about you.

520
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,395
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

521
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,195
Everybody's wondering where you're going,
why you did it.

522
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,791
The great American cowboy
and the worid-champion horse...

523
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,273
...riding into the sunset...

524
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,188
Boy, are you full of shit.
With all due respect, ma'am.

525
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,596
- And you're standin' in poison sumac.
- Oh!

526
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,070
Come on, son. Come on, boy.

527
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,511
If you think you're gettin' away from me
you're not, cos I'm gonna follow you.

528
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,316
I'm gonna follow you till you tell me
what you're gonna do with the horse.

529
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,190
What are you doing?

530
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,997
Oh, my God!

531
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,874
Now it shouldn't take you more
than about 15 minutes to change that.

532
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,788
Goddamn you! You're nuts! I'm gonna call
the cops. I got your license plate.

533
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,194
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

534
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,677
No, you won't. I know what you'll do.
You'll milk this story for all it's worth.

535
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,635
You don't want me to be captured.
A captured horse thief ain't no story.

536
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,431
It was from this hotel that Rising Star,
greatest money-winner in racing history...

537
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,189
...and corporate symbol for one
of the worid's largest conglomerates...

538
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,311
...was taken late Friday night.

539
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,638
Yesterday I uncovered information
which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele.

540
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,158
<i> Now to raise</i>
<i>the old Stars and Stripes</i>.

541
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,714
<i>Where's that blasted flagpole?</i>

542
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,434
<i>Good gracious! A bird's nest!</i>

543
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,118
<i>How clumsy of me. I hope</i>
<i>I didn't step on your eggs, birdie</i>.

544
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,511
You got any shoelaces?

545
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,234
- What?
- Shoelaces?

546
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,557
Anita, get rid of that stuff.
Over here by the cash register.

547
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,358
<i>By the dim glow of a shrouded campfire</i>...

548
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,473
...<i>I saw Rising Star,</i>
<i>and I encountered Sonny Steele himself</i>.

549
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,715
- What?
- What?

550
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,956
- <i>We talked for many hours</i>.
- What?!

551
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,517
<i>As a result of our wide-ranging</i>
<i>conversation, I formed these impressions:</i>

552
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,834
<i>Mr Steele, in my opinion,</i>
<i>did not take the horse for monetary gain</i>...

553
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,396
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

554
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,270
- Where was he?
- I forgot.

555
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,915
- How were you able to find him?
- That's my job.

556
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,235
- What did he tell you, Hallie?
- Nothing.

557
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,229
Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could
put you right in the middle of the story.

558
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,354
We could guarantee
that you get first crack at everything.

559
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,190
I've already had first crack at everything.

560
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,595
Suppose we made it exclusive?

561
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,395
How about if we gave you
exclusive footage on the capture?

562
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,795
Oh, when are you planning that?

563
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,755
Wanna tell me about that confrontation
with Steele at the reception, Mr Sears?

564
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,028
- Miss Martin, we could take you to court.
- You could try.

565
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,592
Aiding a felon during the commission of
a felonious act, concealment of a felony...

566
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,075
"Misprision of felony", the law calls it.

567
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,273
You're not the law. If Ampco wants to take
on the First Amendment, be my guest.

568
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,198
That oughta sell
a whole lot of breakfast cereal.

569
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,835
I'll be around,
if you wanna handcuff me later.

570
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,874
- We <i>could</i> take her to court.
- Have her locked up.

571
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,912
And gain what? The last thing
we need is a female martyr.

572
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,998
At least he didn't say anything
about mistreating the horse.

573
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,714
- Do we know that?
- I think she'd have said something.

574
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,957
You "think". It's a chance
we can't afford to take.

575
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,237
Do we have a choice?

576
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,717
We could make sure that if he speaks
to anyone he won't be believed.

577
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,630
Can you get to the media
by the 11 o'clock news?

578
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,838
How the hell did she find him,
we ain't even heard from him?

579
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,599
We sent her over there,
that's how she found him.

580
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,510
Well, she buddied up to me. She tried
to buy me drinks, said she liked my ring...

581
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,916
She liked your ring, she liked
my watch, I liked her eyes...

582
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,192
That's how those people are. They tell
you they're your friend, and they use you.

583
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,151
Well, what are we gonna do?

584
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,999
I don't know about you.
I'm gonna get a bottle of tequila...

585
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,830
...one of those keno girls that can suck the
chrome off a trailer hitch, and kick back.

586
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,596
<i>10.59 here at KLSG in St George,</i>
<i>and here's Harvey Del Rio</i>...

587
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,111
If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep
standin', boy, we'd have this licked.

588
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,639
<i>In Las Vegas, investigators still have no</i>
<i>leads to the whereabouts of Rising Star,</i>...

589
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,877
...<i>whose ab duction by Sonny Steele</i>
<i>triggered a massive search</i>.

590
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,276
<i>Ampco officials are expressing alarm</i>
<i>over the welfare of the horse</i>.

591
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,279
<i>According to one, Steele has a long history</i>
<i>of alcoholism and drug abuse</i>.

592
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,234
<i>He's appeared in public in an intoxicated</i>
<i>state on several occasions,</i>...

593
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,635
...<i>and has been abusive</i>
<i>to press and public</i>.

594
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,957
<i>They believe if the horse is to survive,</i>
<i>time is of the essence</i>.

595
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,878
Excuse me, Miss Martin?
I'm Charlotta Steele.

596
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,390
- I was married to Sonny.
- Yes, I know.

597
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,195
I don't mean to bother you, but
I was just wonderin' if he was all right.

598
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,278
- He isn't hurt?
- No.

599
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,117
- Are you gonna be seein' him again?
- Well, we haven't made any plans. Why?

600
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,712
Just wonderin'.

601
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,638
- Why do you think he did it?
- I don't know.

602
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,277
He gets ornery. Guess it takes him a long
time to admit he's got a horn in his gut.

603
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,959
What <i>is</i> the horn in his gut, Mrs Steele?

604
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,515
All's I know is he musta had a good
reason, or he woulda been back by now.

605
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,792
He's no thief by nature.
I mean, it takes your breath!

606
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,078
You know, they only said
those bad things about him.

607
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,193
They didn't say what's decent. Even
though it is hard to find it sometimes.

608
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,276
How'd you meet Sonny?

609
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,550
Hallie Martin, please.

610
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,995
- What?
- <i>You alone?</i>

611
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,439
- Who is this?
- Are you alone?

612
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,791
OK, fella, say your dirties. Get it over with.

613
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,113
It's time for another
wide-rangin' conversation.

614
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,033
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is it you?

615
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,720
Right from the dim glow
of the shrouded campfire.

616
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,795
<i>You maniac!</i>

617
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,115
I broke three nails changing that tyre.

618
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,999
- You want a story?
- Yes.

619
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,555
- Can you leave without anybody knowin'?
- If I can't, I won't come.

620
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,479
- Who saw him?
- Some little shopkeeper in Utah.

621
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,036
Near St George, about five last night.
He must've gotten a vehicle.

622
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,314
So if he stopped for the night he should
be within 150 miles of St George.

623
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,034
- Who knows this?
- The local police are taken care of.

624
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,390
- The press?
- No, not yet, not yet.

625
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,876
- We'll take care of it.
- Can we cover the surrounding towns?

626
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,117
Taking care of it now. We'll concentrate
on Liberty and Cedarville.

627
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,392
You and Toland take the jet.
You can organise this from St George.

628
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,353
- If he stopped for the night.
- He must sleep sometimes.

629
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,869
He crossed the state line.
The FBI will want in.

630
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,595
- Can you keep 'em out?
- They already know he's been spotted.

631
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,714
Then get to him first. Tell him we won't
prosecute. Do whatever you have to do.

632
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,115
Just don't let him start up
about the horse.

633
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,910
I'm here!

634
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,351
Hey, I'm here!

635
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,675
I'm alone. No troops.

636
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,639
Come on. Come on.

637
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,870
Oh... Oh, God!

638
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,195
I think I've broken my leg.

639
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,710
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

640
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,155
Here. Get your camera ready.

641
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,072
Uh...

642
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,510
Listen, would you mind standing
over here with that background?

643
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,313
No, this is all right. Right here.

644
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,079
But I think it'd be more dramatic
in front of...

645
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,478
Tell 'em it was dramatic.
You got a colourful imagination.

646
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,120
Listen, I've been driving all night,
and I'm not used to being talked to like...

647
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,629
I'm not used to being called a horse thief.

648
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,070
What do <i>you</i> call
a man who steals horses?

649
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,759
Have you ever seen this horse race?

650
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,759
Have you ever seen... I've seen him run.

651
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,994
I saw him stumble and fall back,
and lose his stride, and pick himself up.

652
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,112
I saw him stretch out
when he had <i>nothin'</i> left to give...

653
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,038
...but he found it... somewhere.

654
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,230
And he won.

655
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,069
Lady, that horse is a champion.
He's got a heart the size of a locomotive.

656
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,035
He's got more heart, and more drive,
and more... soul...

657
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,552
...than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.

658
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,717
Trot him round with dancing girls,
ta-da-da-ta-ta!

659
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,630
They'd have him wearin' short pants and
smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!

660
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,754
They got him tanked up on tranquillisers
and bute, stickin' him full of needles...

661
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,475
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up,
he's shot full of steroids...

662
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,558
And it's just for looks.
Makes the horse sterile!

663
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,069
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...

664
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,752
Even if they wanted to breed him, pass on
some of them fine qualities, they couldn't.

665
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,077
To say nothin' of what
the horse hisself is missin'.

666
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,553
So...

667
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,110
...so I took him.

668
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,709
Come on, let's go. Get this...

669
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,750
Let's crank up this little hummer
and I'll... give ya a speech. Or try.

670
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,716
All right?

671
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,436
Any time you're... Can you see me?
Can you see the horse?

672
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,313
Yeah. Keep going. I can see everything.

673
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,838
Uh, this here is Sonny Steele...

674
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,474
...and, uh, his name is Risin' Star.

675
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,829
And he's one of the best.

676
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:37,839
He's one of the greatest animals
in the... in the history of... animals.

677
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,989
Maybe they bought him.
Maybe they own him.

678
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,272
But there's some rights you can't buy.
Even from an animal.

679
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,514
Now, this horse earned a better life.
I'm gonna try and see that he gets it.

680
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,432
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll do it.

681
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,792
Appreciate your comin'.
You got stamina.

682
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,875
- It's a family trait.
- You'll forgive me for not entertainin'.

683
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,673
I gotta tend this horse
and get him movin'.

684
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,712
Listen, can I... can I come with you?

685
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,034
No!

686
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,398
Why? I wouldn't be any...

687
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,078
- Trouble?
- No.

688
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:53,995
- Well, here, let me give you my card.
- Your what?

689
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:59,592
Card. Sometimes you think of something
you forgot to say, or... wish you'd said.

690
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,556
Steele, what <i>are</i> you gonna do with him?

691
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,717
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me anything.

692
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,878
Enough.

693
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,117
- Why does it have to be a big secret?
- So they can't stop me.

694
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,356
From doing what?

695
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,070
I'm gonna turn him loose.

696
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,792
What?! Rising Star?

697
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,549
I'm gonna get him back
to where he was, what he was.

698
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,832
It's in his blood. He knows what to do.
He's just half forgot, is all.

699
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,110
But he's a thoroughbred racehorse!

700
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,596
Maybe it isn't gonna work, lady.
Maybe he ain't gonna make it...

701
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,998
...but at least he's gonna try. He's gonna
have his own shot at it, that's all.

702
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,669
- Where?
- Where? Have a safe trip back, miss.

703
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,268
Miss, my ass!
Where will you do it? Do you know?

704
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,550
- I know.
- Who else knows?

705
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,956
I don't know. Maybe he does.
Why don't you interview him?

706
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,640
You know you're gonna
screw up your whole life?

707
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,672
Goddamnit, I'm trying to <i>unscrew</i> it, lady!

708
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,271
- Wendell says you forgot your best part.
- Wendell? Oh, he's a good man, Wendell.

709
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,958
- Is it true?
- Nope.

710
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,517
- Charlotta says you screw up...
- Charlotta? You got her in on this too?

711
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,596
Don't tell me.

712
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,548
She says you take her breath away.

713
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,438
Yeah, well, that's not hard to do.
She's all breath anyway.

714
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,836
She's, uh, she's pretty.

715
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,315
Yes, she is pretty.

716
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,672
She said that when you two
first met you... Oh...

717
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,598
Wait, that canyon
where you went on your honeymoon...

718
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,995
- Damn that woman.
- With wild mustangs.

719
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,350
Goddamn that woman!

720
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,711
- Rim Rock. Rim Rock!
- That's why I left her.

721
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,435
That's exactly why I left her,
her and her big m... Or she left me.

722
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,393
Anyway, I'm not goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon.

723
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,435
I have an idea. Let's go into town,
have a cup of coffee, and talk about it.

724
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,710
My treat.

725
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,678
- Huh?
- I'm not gonna be... No.

726
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,794
I'm not gonna be passin' a...
Now where'd I put that son of a bitch?

727
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,989
Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin'
a mailbox, so if you'd be...

728
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,476
- It's got a stamp on it.
- Yeah, first one I pass.

729
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,996
Well...

730
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,671
What do I do? Just take this road
back to the broken tree?

731
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,839
Yeah. Same way you came.
Only backwards.

732
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,599
- Don't lose my card.
- Oh, no, it's... Goodbye.

733
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,359
OK, good luck, wherever you're going.

734
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,508
Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures.

735
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,155
And wait till you hear the talk.
People are gonna eat him up!

736
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,909
Tell me an affiliate between here and
Vegas. I wanna get this on the cable.

737
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,679
<i>Hold your horses</i>...
<i>Hear that about horses?</i>

738
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,475
Les, I am trying to convey a sense
of urgency. I want this on the air today.

739
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,229
<i>OK. KLSG</i>-<i>TV in St George, Utah</i>.
<i>Looks like about 60 miles</i>.

740
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,430
OK, now pay attention. This is crucial.

741
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,519
I need a camera crew to meet me at a
place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah.

742
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,791
- Try the Automobile Club or something.
- <i>When do you need 'em?</i>

743
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,391
They should leave right now, cos I don't
know when I'll get there or he'll get there.

744
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,511
And they should be prepared to camp out.

745
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,518
I have a feeling this place
does not have a Hilton Hotel.

746
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,474
I mean, this is a place
<i>horses</i> like, Les, and...

747
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,834
Les, when Steele gets there,
he's gonna turn Rising Star loose.

748
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,995
<i>What?!</i>

749
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,272
$12 million worth of thoroughbred
racehorse, loose in horse heaven.

750
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,992
Think you got a story?

751
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,556
<i>Stick with the lunatic, Hallie</i>.
<i>Tape everything. This is gold!</i>

752
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,195
- He doesn't want me around.
- <i>That never stopped you before</i>.

753
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,595
<i>Just find some way to talk to the guy</i>.

754
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,111
Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew
and I'll talk to you later.

755
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,950
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody rob a bank?

756
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:27,234
I don't know for sure. I think somebody
may have spotted that cereal cowboy.

757
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,309
Hello?

758
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,796
Hi. Listen, are you, uh...
are you going to St George?

759
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,751
'Less they moved the road.

760
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,873
- You're wearin' out your welcome, lady.
- There's a cop convention back there.

761
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,831
- What?
- I saw two patrol cars...

762
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,872
...two motorcycle cops,
a county marshal and a sheriff.

763
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,198
- You said nobody'd follow you.
- They didn't. An expert got me out.

764
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,231
Expert, huh?

765
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,512
Hey.

766
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,757
- Wait a minute.
- Why? You wanna film the capture?

767
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,757
I am in as much trouble as you are.

768
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,759
If I go back I'll have to tell them
everything I know. And I mean everything.

769
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,793
If I don't, I'll go to jail.
It's called misprision of felony.

770
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,309
You go ahead and tell 'em.
I'll be long gone.

771
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,718
I can't. Don't you understand? I can't
divulge sources and expect anybody...

772
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,035
"Divulge sources"...? What are you doin'?

773
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,071
- Besides...
- Wait a minute...

774
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,634
Hey! Hold it!
What do you think you're doin'?

775
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,354
I'd have to tell them about Gus.

776
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,436
I would.

777
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,313
Ohh! God!

778
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,510
What are we gonna do?

779
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,633
Get on the floor.

780
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,354
- What?
- Do it. Get on the floor.

781
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,160
- Easy, boy.
- What are we doing?

782
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,670
You stay right there. When I go
out the back, you count to 60.

783
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,394
- Out the back...?
- Then drive the hell outta here.

784
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,432
- The cops'll chase me.
- You're crazy!

785
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,632
Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls.

786
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,832
There's a lake there
at the bottom of some dry red cliffs.

787
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,838
- Well, where is Cisco Falls?
- Find it. You found me.

788
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,030
But, no, listen... You can't...
You can't make it out there.

789
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,152
- There's at least dozen cops!
- That'll be up to him.

790
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,512
OK now, junkie, no excuses. Tendon's
gone down, you ain't wheezin' any more...

791
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,393
...and, goddamn, I've seen you run.
Let's go.

792
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,670
No, wait! You can't...

793
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,869
That's him!

794
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,518
...28, 29, 30...

795
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,112
...58, 59, 60.

796
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,113
He's in Bundy's Field.

797
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,834
- <i>We can't follow him</i>.
- Ten-four.

798
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,232
He's headin' for the dam.

799
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,829
Come on, come on! Do it! Do it!

800
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,994
Go! Go!

801
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,870
Come on! Come on! Go!

802
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,075
All the way! Go! Go!

803
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,476
For chrissake, look out!

804
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,436
Oh, jeez!

805
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,875
- <i>How did he get away?</i>
- <i>On a horse</i>.

806
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,752
<i>On a horse. Find him</i>.

807
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,110
Bring him back here.

808
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,279
Use the FBI. Use the state police.
Use helicopters.

809
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,516
Put out a reward - a large one.

810
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,916
Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines.
Where is he, Utah?

811
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,272
Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Have them sing him in. But get him!

812
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,276
Hello?

813
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,996
Hello?

814
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,673
Oh, you made it! You made it!

815
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,276
Hey. There's some witch hazel
in the cabinet over the sink...

816
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,233
...and there's an old T-shirt by the bunk.

817
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,835
I owe you one, buddy.

818
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,756
Is he all right?

819
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,438
Easy.

820
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,713
They didn't chase me. You were right.

821
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,991
You should've seen yourself.
You were great.

822
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,156
You were.

823
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,279
Were you surprised that I got here?

824
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,958
No.

825
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:59,071
It was on the road map. I didn't even
need to ask anybody or anything.

826
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,472
Easy, boy.

827
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,955
It's gonna be getting dark soon.

828
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,474
How long does it take
to drive to Rim Rock Canyon?

829
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,672
Few days. Only we ain't drivin'.

830
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,955
What?

831
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:18,834
Cops'll be lookin' everywhere
for that camper. We'll have to leave it.

832
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,675
- And do what?
- Walk.

833
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,036
<i> I've seen him run</i>.
<i>I saw him stumble and fall back,</i>...

834
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,549
...<i>lose his stride, and pick himself up</i>.
- You bet!

835
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,514
<i>He had nothin' left to give,</i>
<i>but he found it</i>... <i>somewhere</i>.

836
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,760
...<i>and more drive, and more</i>... <i>soul</i>
<i>than most people you'll ever know</i>.

837
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,711
<i>And they hang lights on him</i>.

838
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,912
<i>Trot him round with dancing girls,</i>
<i>ta-da-da-ta-ta!</i>

839
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,238
<i>They'd have him wearin' short pants and</i>
<i>smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!</i>

840
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,716
...<i>stickin' him full of needles</i>...
<i>Look at this tendon. It's all filled up</i>.

841
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,150
<i>He's shot full of steroids</i>...
<i>And it's just for looks. Makes him sterile!</i>

842
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,555
<i>So even if</i>...
<i>God, that's what's so damn funny</i>...

843
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,797
<i>Even if they wanted to pass on</i>
<i>them fine qualities, they couldn't</i>.

844
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:04,437
I could tape a bit along the way.
Nothing that'll give away where we are.

845
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,633
And maybe I could find someone that
could take it to the network, like today.

846
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,799
And since you figure it's gonna be
a long trip, that would give us...

847
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,876
Oh, no, I'm not hungry, thanks.

848
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,198
That would give us, what,
maybe four or five more days on news.

849
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:24,350
That way, once you set Rising Star free,
the whole country will be behind you.

850
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,755
Then I'd just have to keep
lookin' back over my shoulder.

851
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,159
- What's so funny?
- Do you want to go to jail?

852
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:33,951
No.

853
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,753
Well, how do you think
this is gonna end up?

854
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,275
Not on television.

855
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,837
OK, I, uh... respect your position.

856
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,751
I do. I don't understand it,
but I respect it.

857
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,434
A lot of famous people hated publicity.

858
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,115
Albert Schweitzer, Franco...

859
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,680
Albert Schweitzer... Um...

860
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,190
How you doin', partner?

861
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,429
- Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.
- You didn't.

862
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,918
What are we... doing?

863
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,996
Going to sleep.

864
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,670
- I'm not sleepy.
- You weren't hungry, either.

865
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,315
It's gonna be a long way, lady. Long way.

866
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,155
Well, um... where am I supposed to...?

867
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,430
Wherever you want.

868
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:15,074
Where the hell are we,
the Donner Pass, for God's sakes?

869
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,558
I'm ready.

870
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,240
I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus.

871
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,072
When they spot that camper
they're gonna trace it right to him.

872
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,589
What... what are you doin' with that?

873
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,752
This is expensive equipment,
and I'm responsible for it.

874
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,270
- I'm not gonna leave it there.
- We're walkin'. With our feet.

875
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,119
There's no escalators out here,
or bellhops.

876
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,198
- Uh...
- Oh, no. He ain't carryin' it.

877
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,914
- I didn't ask.
- And I ain't carryin' it, and you can't.

878
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,996
I've carried this stuff a lot of times.

879
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:55,319
Where? Up the escalator at Bloomington's,
or Bloomingberg's, or wherever it is?

880
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,194
Bloomingdale's. And what the hell
do you know about New York?

881
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,035
Ever hear of the Madison Square Gardens?

882
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:02,831
No.

883
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,635
They got a rodeo there, and it's
a damn big thing. And I've been in it.

884
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,320
Well, I've been to the rodeo. Twice.

885
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,276
Did you stay
for the rattlesnake roundup?

886
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,755
Yes. I stayed right to the end.
I saw the whole thing.

887
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,350
They don't have one. How are you
gonna round up a rattlesnake?

888
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,519
Oh, God. I'm just trying to be pleasant.
You get so worked up about everything.

889
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,996
What have I got to be worked up about?
I've only got a stole horse...

890
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,830
...everybody but the Coast Guard after me,
and now I'm carryin' a crazy woman...

891
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:38,988
...wearin' shoes from Bloomingberg's, that
thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup.

892
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,630
Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it.
Only it ain't goin' on my horse.

893
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,990
Your horse

894
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,949
Ahh... Here, give me
those glasses, would you?

895
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,350
They're prescription.

896
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,077
You wait here with him
till I get back, ya hear?

897
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,114
But if you're spotted
and you don't come back...

898
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,037
Call your lawyer.

899
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,072
Hello. Can I help you?

900
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,236
Howdy. Uh...

901
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:24,390
Well, uh, I'm broke down the road apiece,
and I wondered if I could use your phone...

902
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,594
I got a friend in Mesquite, and he's in
a bit of trouble, so I need to use a phone.

903
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:33,713
I'd be obliged if I could use yours.
Happy to pay you for it.

904
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,197
- We got a phone. Come on in.
- Oh. Great. Appreci... Appreciate it.

905
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,953
Phone's right there. You help yourself.

906
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,756
Thank you.

907
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,160
- Hello?
- <i>Gus, it's Sonny</i>.

908
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,269
Sonny!

909
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,994
I gotta talk to you.
I can't talk long. Now listen...

910
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,793
- <i>Sonny!</i>
- Gus, please, just listen real careful.

911
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,071
- I'm in the kitchen.
- <i>People are gonna come, probably police</i>.

912
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,909
They're gonna ask you about the camper.
I want you to tell 'em I stole it.

913
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,554
Say it, Gus. "Sonny stole the camper."

914
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,478
My Wild Blue Yonder? I bought it in Elko.

915
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,718
No, Gus. I bought it for you, remember?
And I'll buy you a nice new one.

916
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,913
When the people ask about the camper,
tell them "Sonny stole the camper."

917
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,873
Try to remember it.
I'll see ya, friend. I gotta go.

918
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,311
Oh, uh...

919
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,557
Partner, I'm much obliged
for the use of that phone.

920
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,274
Here. Five oughta cover it.

921
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,356
Mr Steele...

922
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,988
...I don't want your money.

923
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,554
I saw you on the television.
You and the horse.

924
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,070
I want you to know
I'd be proud to help you any way I can.

925
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,034
Right now, it looks like
we oughta get you out of this county.

926
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,352
How do you like it so far?

927
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,834
Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good?

928
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,919
Doin' all right. Got the whole worid
lookin' for that cowboy.

929
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,636
He's probably over that mountain by now.
I'd go take a nap on my porch.

930
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,672
I wouldn't wanna find him anyway -
except for that reward.

931
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,235
50,000 bucks is a mound of cash.

932
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,836
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

933
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,713
All right, you're clear. Come on down.

934
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:05,155
I don't know where you're headed, but
Escalante's six miles over that mountain.

935
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:10,434
The woman put together some stuff -
bread and cake and stew and coffee.

936
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,949
I put a bottle in there
to keep your blood pumpin'.

937
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,150
- I sure do thank you.
- Ain't no need to.

938
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,478
Listen, there's not many people
you'd trust $50,000 worth.

939
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:24,512
You better get on over the mountain
'fore it comes to me what I'm passin' up.

940
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,556
Come on.

941
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,796
Oh, my God!

942
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,949
- Can we rest a little?
- Not yet.

943
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,358
- Where the hell are we?
- Well, not in jail, look at it that way.

944
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,269
- I can't go any farther.
- Oh, sure you can.

945
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:53,997
Hell, I've known people go through stuff.
I knew a guy... misjudged a Brahma once.

946
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:58,830
Put his rib through his right lung,
the guy could hardly breathe...

947
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,756
He still got up and rode
the rankest mare there.

948
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:09,233
I will never understand why you find
that kind of behaviour admirable.

949
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,830
- Gets you up the hill.
- I have to rest... for a minute.

950
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,036
Hey, Steele?

951
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,991
Sonny?

952
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,554
Norman!

953
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,750
How do you know "Norman"?

954
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,635
I never divulge sources.

955
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:35,509
"Divulge sources"..."Divulge sources"...

956
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,919
Here, get up. Come on.
You sure do your homework, don't you?

957
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,557
Try to put your mind on somethin' else,
make things easier.

958
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,349
Get it off your feet.

959
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,671
Do you know "The Star-Spangled Banner"?

960
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,711
- What?!
- The national anthem?

961
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,391
I know it's the national anthem.
You mean can I sing it? It's hard to sing.

962
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,273
Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is?

963
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,998
Hey, that's a very interesting question.
Why don't we sit down and discuss it?

964
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,509
I used to be a psychology major.

965
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,837
"America the Beautiful",
that's an easy tune to carry.

966
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,633
Why don't we sit down
and sing it together?

967
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,716
# O spa...

968
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,116
# O beautiful for spacious skies

969
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,268
# With amber waves of grain

970
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,914
- Come on. Come on, sing it.
- Oh, God!

971
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,670
# For purple mountains majesty

972
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,715
# Above the fruited plain

973
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:44,638
# America, America...

974
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,349
Halloween.

975
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,592
Ha...

976
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,750
Hal-louise?

977
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,920
- What?
- Your name: Hallie.

978
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,150
That's not your name.

979
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,116
Alice.

980
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,278
My name is Alice.

981
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,917
My kid sister used
to holler at me after school.

982
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,069
She'd yell "Haaa-lice!"

983
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,594
So they called me Hallie.

984
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,950
Alice Martin.

985
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,830
That fits you.

986
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,711
I used to bite and pinch a lot too.

987
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,637
I'll bet you did.

988
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,230
It's mustangs. Mares.
They smell the horse.

989
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,389
You know what you need?

990
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,953
A pair of proper shoes.

991
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,189
Hey.

992
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,876
Where are we?

993
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,716
Are we lost?

994
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,236
Lost?

995
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,238
No.

996
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,033
Good night... Alice.

997
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:05,949
Good night, Norman.

998
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,549
If she's with Steele, then the network
will know where they are.

999
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,035
That's the news department, Mr Sears.

1000
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,516
I don't think they'll want
to give out that kind of information.

1001
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,916
Are you saying we spent
$80 to $100 million in TV time...

1002
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,429
...and we can't get
a simple piece of information?

1003
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,916
- No, sir, I'm not saying that...
- You don't ask the news department.

1004
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,271
Ask the advertising department.
They'll ask the news department.

1005
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,510
What are you doin' up?

1006
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,796
Nothing much.

1007
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,039
You've had a hard day.
Why don't you scrunch down in the bag?

1008
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,675
Oh, I wish it were that easy.

1009
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,316
I don't sleep.

1010
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,515
Ever?

1011
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,870
How old are you?

1012
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,995
Not in front of... in front
of people I don't know.

1013
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,590
You slept last night.

1014
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,870
The hell I did.

1015
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,915
Not in front of a stranger.

1016
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:06,079
What, are you afraid of what you'll
look like with your mouth open?

1017
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,230
You have a mean streak in you.

1018
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,232
No.

1019
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,316
No, I don't.

1020
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,395
I still pinch and bite.

1021
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,872
OK.

1022
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,156
Morning.

1023
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,435
I'm still here.

1024
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,839
There's... there's coffee from last night.
It's probably cold.

1025
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,399
It probably is, if it hasn't been heated.

1026
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,910
And there's cheese.

1027
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,516
Cheese.

1028
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,270
You're all bent. Are you sick?

1029
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,956
No. Just bent.

1030
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,518
Well... Here, have some cheese.

1031
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:09,153
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

1032
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,753
I know. I'm the one that said it.

1033
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,078
- Are you sure you're not hurt?
- No. Just...

1034
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,112
...some parts wake up faster than others.

1035
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,433
Broke parts take a little longer, though.

1036
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,354
I, uh, I would've called a cab,
left you a note.

1037
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,756
You know, "Call me",
with my phone number.

1038
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:51,119
Actually, I'd have left my answering
service number, just stuck it on the...

1039
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,992
What's the matter?

1040
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,715
I wanna know what's botherin' you.

1041
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,470
It was just you and me last night.
It's not gonna be on television.

1042
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,270
- Is it?
- I don't know what you mean.

1043
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:11,871
The problem is you get up slowly, I get
up fast. It's... the way that I was raised.

1044
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,879
- Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up.
- We just got up, and got to work.

1045
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,070
I was up before the sun
ever hit your room.

1046
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,192
Well, then you get the getting-up medal.

1047
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,669
Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry?
Isn't that what you said?

1048
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,190
Good mornin', Alice.

1049
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,716
Good morning.

1050
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,629
You're right. We are in a hurry.

1051
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,948
But let's say we lighten up a bit.

1052
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,635
I think that's a great idea. Lighten up.

1053
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,594
We're gonna be travelling together
a little while...

1054
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,714
Oh...

1055
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,149
There. All lightened up.

1056
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,231
...<i>temperatures are dipping</i>
<i>below freezing in the high plateau</i>.

1057
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,238
<i>On the national scene,</i>
<i>the search for Sonny Steele</i>...

1058
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,399
...<i>is concentrated in central Utah</i>.
<i>KLSG switchboards have been jammed</i>...

1059
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,717
- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls.
- There ain't any.

1060
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,513
Hell, you can name anything anything.

1061
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:36,357
It's like those people who
look up at the stars and see things.

1062
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:40,393
Chickens and bulls and chariots
and snakes and shit...

1063
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,119
What's this guy's name who's supposed
to have a belt? Ryan, or O'Ryan...

1064
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,629
Hell, there ain't no belt up there.

1065
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,399
Probably there was a falls here once.

1066
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,437
This whole land was under water
millions of years ago.

1067
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:02,793
If you go... if you go slow,
take your time and you look real close...

1068
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:07,072
...you can find skeletons of these
weird-lookin' fishes in the hardpan...

1069
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,395
...long, long gone.

1070
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,952
All these mountains...
Hell, everything, everything you can see...

1071
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,154
...everything, was under an ocean once.

1072
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:28,398
- What are you smilin' at?
- I'm just enjoying the fact that you...

1073
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,833
...that you know all that. It's interesting.

1074
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,280
Well, this country's where I live.

1075
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,870
- Don't you know where the subways go?
- Not lately.

1076
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,231
Oh, yeah, you do.

1077
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,871
How'd you know to find me?

1078
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,595
Musta been 70, 80 reporters there,
but you were the one that found me.

1079
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,712
Just had a few hunches
and got a head start.

1080
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:57,952
Oh, you had more than that, Alice.
You are good.

1081
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,996
Let's go.

1082
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,070
Here, give me that stuff here.

1083
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,476
OK, I want you to put
your left foot right here.

1084
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,591
- Come on.
- I don't know how to ride.

1085
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,473
You're not gonna ride.
I'm gonna be doin' the steering.

1086
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,592
Listen, I'm not interested in horses.
They're... too big.

1087
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,234
Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body.

1088
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,797
We're not gonna get anywhere
with you in them spiky shoes. Come on.

1089
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,997
- Oh, God...
- OK, swing your right leg right on over.

1090
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,315
That's it. There you go.

1091
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,716
Here.

1092
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,435
- Uh, should I pet him?
- Do what you want. He ain't no dog.

1093
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,437
<i> Doyle Hicks</i>.
<i>Go ahead, you're on the air</i>.

1094
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,074
- <i> Is this Doyle?</i>
- <i>Turn down your radio</i>.

1095
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,237
<i>Yeah, well, I just wanna say</i>
<i>that what Sonny Steele done</i>...

1096
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,272
...<i>is wonderful news</i>
<i>for the animals of this country</i>.

1097
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,791
<i> If somebody's poisoning an</i>
<i>animal, a person should try and stop it</i>.

1098
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,480
<i> I'd have done</i>
<i>the same damn thing myself</i>.

1099
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,559
<i>Them Ampco people</i>
<i>got no right to dope up a horse</i>.

1100
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,234
- What you got?
- Not gonna throw this away, are you?

1101
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,475
- What is it?
- Just notes.

1102
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,318
Can I see 'em?

1103
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,590
They're just my notes.

1104
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:04,839
- What are these, in Russian?
- That's my handwriting.

1105
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,110
- Well, read 'em.
- No.

1106
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,875
You got a secret?

1107
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:22,232
"I feel I'm seeing this country
for the first time."

1108
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,949
"Not looking down
from a jet 30,000ft up...

1109
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:32,950
...but from the low angle... of a special
man who means to cross it on foot...

1110
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:38,359
...leading a thoroughbred stallion to
a secret destination... to a private goal."

1111
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:43,958
"To a fairness that he intends
to find in these valleys."

1112
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:49,598
"I..." I can't. They're just my notes.
I'm embarrassed.

1113
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,672
Nice.

1114
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,958
- It's hype.
- Coulda fooled me.

1115
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,873
She ordered a camera crew
to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon.

1116
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,549
- I suppose to photograph the...
- The ceremony.

1117
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,148
The sales figures again, exactly.

1118
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,511
In the three days since he took the horse,
office equipment has been as projected...

1119
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,551
The cereal.

1120
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,989
Cumulatively, up 30 per cent.

1121
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:30,274
And by closing time today
they'd emptied the shelves.

1122
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,997
Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it?

1123
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:42,353
Well, sir, there's something here
that I think you should be aware of.

1124
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:50,235
- Where'd you get that?
- There are kids selling 'em on the street.

1125
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,389
Now that's not supposed to be there.

1126
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,750
Or we're not supposed to be here.

1127
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,836
<i>You're</i> lost?

1128
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,789
About a mile's worth, I'd say.
We gotta get off this ridge.

1129
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,596
Maybe... Do...

1130
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,556
- Maybe I could get us some supplies.
- We got enough supplies. Let's go.

1131
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:15,474
Oh!

1132
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,916
Here, here...

1133
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,996
You OK?

1134
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,632
Are you all right?

1135
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,830
A- OK.

1136
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,475
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1137
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,792
Maybe you ought to sit down.

1138
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,869
- You don't understand the problem.
- Well, lay down or somethin'. Here.

1139
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,514
And listen to you bitch about my boots?
No, thank you.

1140
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:43,552
No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em.
Here. Right here.

1141
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,989
Oh... God, my back.

1142
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,272
Easy.

1143
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,516
Let's take a look.

1144
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:54,515
You just relax, cos we're makin'
good time, don't worry.

1145
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,796
Hold on.

1146
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,433
Here.

1147
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,629
Oh.

1148
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,671
Little hair of the dog.

1149
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,233
Oh!

1150
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,194
- I feel better already.
- Yeah, well, don't put it away.

1151
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:41,038
Hey, why don't you get some rest?
I'll go find us a place to cross the road.

1152
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,236
I won't be long.

1153
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,635
Hi, there. What's your name?

1154
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,278
- Louise.
- Oh! Same as mine.

1155
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,671
You, uh... you taking care
of this place all by yourself?

1156
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,351
- Is your name really Louise?
- You bet. Your mom and dad here?

1157
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:10,313
My mom went to get butane.
We're all out.

1158
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,036
- You have a telephone?
- It's out too.

1159
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:17,711
Every time it snows up at Marysville,
first thing, the phone goes out.

1160
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,796
Where's your car?

1161
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,393
Oh, I'm... I'm sort of camping out,
and my car went on the blink.

1162
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:27,910
And I, uh... I need
to get a message to my boss.

1163
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,998
Are you gonna be near a phone later on?
After you close up?

1164
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,838
Well, we got a phone at home.

1165
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,474
I bet you could call for me
and get a message to him.

1166
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,115
Could you do that? How much
do you charge to make a call?

1167
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,798
One dollar.

1168
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,878
That's fair. OK, let me
give you the phone number...

1169
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,118
...and when you get him on the phone, ask
for Les Charles. Don't talk to anybody else.

1170
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,356
And tell him you're calling for me...

1171
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:52,994
- For Louise.
- No... Yeah.

1172
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:55,759
- Louise, in Utah.
- I know what state it is.

1173
01:38:55,880 --> 01:39:01,716
Tell him I said call off the crew, call off
everything. I'll explain when I see him.

1174
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,071
- Shouldn't I say your car broke down?
- No, no. Just the rest of it.

1175
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:09,034
- About the flu?
- No, the <i>crew</i>. I'll write it out for you.

1176
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,799
- Her car broke down.
- Oh, where's it at, miss?

1177
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,956
Well, it...

1178
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,719
Well, it didn't really break down,
it's just acting...

1179
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,910
And I have to call her boss about it.

1180
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:22,874
Say, aren't you... You know, television.
You've seen her.

1181
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,037
- Last week I saw her.
- News. News. News commentator.

1182
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:29,470
It's too complicated, Louise.
Thanks anyway.

1183
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:33,273
- What's your name? Please.
- Louise.

1184
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,910
Found us a spot.

1185
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,359
- How you doin'?
- Good as new.

1186
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,076
Serves you right.

1187
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:51,672
There's a place we can cross the road
about a mile south.

1188
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:56,430
Gotta honk on it though.
I wanna get there before dark.

1189
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:58,433
We're that close?

1190
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,269
Yeah, for where we can spend the night.
Inside, for a change. Come on.

1191
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,678
Isn't there some closer place where
you guys take horses to let 'em go?

1192
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,553
No. I just usually use the one, myself.

1193
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,632
It's so pretty here.
If I were Rising Star, I'd love to...

1194
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,637
Well, you're not. Come on.

1195
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,992
Do me a favour, will you, Alice?
Don't go tryin' to think like a horse.

1196
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,916
I'll worry about him. You just take notes.

1197
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:43,474
OI' Clark Wembly had this place built.
Us cowboys used to use it for huntin'.

1198
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,115
Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin'.

1199
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,514
He had a voice that was
just like runnin' molasses.

1200
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:56,359
And it'd come over the PA system...
"Sorry you lost, Sonny."

1201
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,439
And there I'd be, lyin' in the dirt, just
havin' been dumped on by some bull...

1202
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,792
...just broke and busted, but ol' Clark's
voice'd come sailin' across...

1203
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,118
...and he'd say "Give him a big hand, folks.
Glad you come. Better luck next time."

1204
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,754
God, Jesus! He was so terrific.

1205
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,437
He made me feel good.
He made me feel like tryin'.

1206
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:20,236
And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho.
Oh, what an animal.

1207
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,510
That horse used to ju...

1208
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:27,949
Bub-bub-blurgh-blurgh,
runnin' right off at the mouth.

1209
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,556
I enjoyed it.

1210
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,152
- When are we gonna get there?
- About midday.

1211
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,876
It's been a long haul.

1212
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,275
Somethin' bothering you?

1213
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,671
- What are you gonna do after?
- Oh, you gonna start with the questions?

1214
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:14,435
Well, when he's loose, chasing mares,
do you just... do you just do the same?

1215
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,915
What do <i>you</i> think?

1216
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:22,591
You're the one takin' the notes.
You're a... clever lady.

1217
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,953
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- You say it like it's a bad word, "clever".

1218
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:29,310
No. I like you bein' smart.

1219
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:35,157
It's just sometimes you're so busy
being clever that I don't...

1220
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,552
When was the last time
you were surprised?

1221
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,636
You.

1222
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,276
You were a surprise.

1223
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,751
I told them.

1224
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,871
Wha... Who?

1225
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,917
I, uh...

1226
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,916
I called the network and I told them
you were going to Rim Rock Canyon.

1227
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,555
And I asked them to meet me there
with a camera crew.

1228
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,278
Oh.

1229
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,357
And that's not all.

1230
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,149
Oh, now for the <i>bad</i> news?

1231
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,832
I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail.
I wasn't in any trouble.

1232
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,599
Well.

1233
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,189
Well, well, well.

1234
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,396
What <i>do</i> you know.

1235
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,915
Oh, Sonny... Please, don't just walk away.

1236
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,191
Don't be like that. Hit me,
yell at me, slap me or something.

1237
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,675
I already slapped you.
First time we was alone.

1238
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:02,396
- Swear to God I wouldn't do it now.
- Oh? Is that right? You a new person?

1239
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,954
It was three days ago.
I didn't understand what...

1240
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,469
Yeah. A lot can happen in three days.

1241
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,832
I didn't want to ruin anything for you,
Sonny.

1242
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:16,033
- I had a job to do and I wanted a story.
- Well, you got it.

1243
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,596
You did it.

1244
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,710
Hey, how about my letter?

1245
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,679
Did you mail it?
Or is that gonna be on TV?

1246
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,756
Oh, please!

1247
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,159
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What I said.

1248
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:46,033
- Why not just take him to another place?
- No.

1249
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,840
- Why?
- I want him at <i>that</i> place.

1250
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,952
Everybody's done their thing.
Ampco did what they had to do...

1251
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,196
...you did, now I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

1252
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,835
Sonny, you can't go there.
They'll be there. The police may be there.

1253
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,714
I can't run for ever. Look, we're either
all goin' to heaven or we ain't.

1254
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:05,435
Besides, you want to see the finish.
Well, be still.

1255
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,476
Let it finish.

1256
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:13,068
Oh, I don't want you to be hurt.

1257
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,554
I've been hurt. I still get up.

1258
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,470
Thanks for the worry.

1259
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,596
Do me a favour?

1260
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:36,757
Tomorrow... don't take notes.

1261
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,555
Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry.

1262
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,470
Better get off.

1263
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,908
How soon before we get there?

1264
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,155
We <i>are</i> there.

1265
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,872
Wait a minute...
The camera crew, they're not here.

1266
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,477
Appears not.

1267
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,637
Well, Star, what do you think of the place?

1268
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,759
They... they must be at another entrance.

1269
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:52,075
Ain't no other entrance.

1270
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,750
Well, then hurry. Maybe they're lost.

1271
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,030
I doubt it.

1272
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,916
Well, where the hell are they?

1273
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,635
Probably in Rim Rock Canyon.
Isn't that where you told 'em to go?

1274
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,349
They'd be about 90 miles north.

1275
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,553
- This isn't...
- This here's Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it?

1276
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:17,557
You...

1277
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:21,150
Oh, no, now! I never said we were goin'
to no Rim Rock Canyon! You said it!

1278
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,078
Hey, look out!
Don't get me with them boots!

1279
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,829
Where is he?
And what was this about a reward?

1280
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,349
- I... I...
- We've been misinformed.

1281
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:34,119
When our own investigation
revealed the truth...

1282
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:36,913
...naturally we understood
Mr Steele's motivation.

1283
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,039
I don't think there's enough food
to last another night.

1284
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:49,757
- I don't think he's coming.
- It's occurred to me.

1285
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,315
Well, Star, you wanna
say goodbye to the lady?

1286
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,756
Hey, boy.

1287
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,829
- Swing your tail.
- Excuse us.

1288
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,952
OK.

1289
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,914
Remember, they're just horses.
Same as you.

1290
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:36,759
Only they've never been broke. But
they ain't won no championships neither.

1291
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:42,796
So when you cross that stallion
and he wants to fight...

1292
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:47,789
...you remember, you got the blood
on your side. And you can take him.

1293
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,271
- Is he just gonna go, just like that?
- You bet.

1294
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,718
- I thought you guys were pals.
- We are.

1295
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:04,029
Make somethin' outta yourself now.

1296
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,999
Yeah. When I see you, Les.
About nine o'clock.

1297
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:04,076
OK, bye-bye.

1298
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,156
There's your bus. Looks like it's on time.

1299
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,630
Oh. Good.

1300
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:22,629
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.

1301
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,439
Maybe not as good as him, but... good.

1302
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,471
What did they say?

1303
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:33,071
Oh, they're full of congratulations.
Can't wait to get the story.

1304
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,829
Especially now that Ampco
has reversed its position.

1305
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,439
Yeah, I'll bet.

1306
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,314
They have me going to Paris next
to cover the elections.

1307
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:46,594
Well, no kiddin'?
That oughta be interesting.

1308
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,874
- More coffee?
- No, not for me, thanks. You want any?

1309
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,238
Yes, please.

1310
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:00,318
Just a little somethin' for the road.

1311
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,439
Ho, ho, ho... Careful there.

1312
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,875
Tell me, Norman...

1313
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,515
...did you think it'd be this tough
to get rid of a pain in the ass like me?

1314
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,391
Ma'am, I had no idea.

1315
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,150
All aboard the bus. Cedar City,
Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado.

1316
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:52,598
Uh, that story you're gonna tell...

1317
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:56,110
It'd be nice if you didn't mention
where it was that we let him go.

1318
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,673
Silver Reef?

1319
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,268
Be nice if you didn't divulge <i>that</i> source.

1320
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,437
I don't know, leave out a name like that...

1321
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,353
What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny?

1322
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:15,912
Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on.

1323
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,755
Find me somethin' simple.

1324
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:25,235
Hard, maybe, but plain and quiet.

1325
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,551
Any bags, ma'am?

1326
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:30,432
Uh, no.

1327
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,672
Uh, hey...?

1328
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,675
I keep wantin' to thank you.

1329
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,234
But then I keep wonderin' what for.

1330
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,030
I know. I know. Me too.

1331
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:51,515
Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel
whenever I see you on television.

1332
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:58,073
Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV.

1333
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,913
So...

1334
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:05,996
All aboard, ma'am.

1335
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:17,840
- So long, Alice.
- So long, Norman.

1336
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:21,035
Have a safe trip back now.

1337
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,514
All charges have been dropped,
and, sources say...

1338
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:41,633
...the Ampco art department
is hard at work designing a new logo.

1339
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,320
As to the whereabouts of Rising Star...

1340
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,555
...nothing further is known.

1341
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:51,434
So ends the bizarre saga
of horse racing's most honoured stallion...

1342
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:54,028
...and the man who set him free.

1343
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:59,559
Except for one note of thanks
from this reporter to Mr Steele...

1344
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:03,832
...for his... cooperation
in bringing this story to you.

1345
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:08,590
<i>This is Hallie Martin in New York,</i>
<i>saying good night</i>.

1346
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,831
<i># At a time</i>

1347
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,076

1348
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:16,192

1349
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:22,513
<i># Hopelessly out of control</i>

1350
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:26,796
<i># There's deceivers</i>

1351
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,876
<i># And believers</i>

1352
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,356
<i># And old in-betweeners</i>

1353
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:37,551
<i># That seem to have no place to go</i>

1354
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:43,589
<i># Well, it's the same old song</i>

1356
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:51,671

1358
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:00,637

1361
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:14,556
<i># Tried all of the bars</i>

1362
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:19,595
<i># And I've nearly gone up in smoke</i>

1363
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:24,630

1364
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:27,479

1365
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,718
