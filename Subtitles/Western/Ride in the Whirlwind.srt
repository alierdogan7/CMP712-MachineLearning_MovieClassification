1
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,468
They're coming.

2
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:59,757
They're coming Hank.

3
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:02,645
It's coming now.

4
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:07,812
You ought to take care of that
Edgar.

5
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:56,757
-Don't move, any of you.
-Move? I'm hit. Darn idiot fool.

6
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,431
You all right Adam?

7
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:06,389
Outside.

8
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,286
Go ahead.

9
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,015
All right. Get on out of here.

10
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:38,858
-What's the matter with that old crock Burn?
- There's something about that grove he don't like.

11
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,432
-Indians?
- Might be.

12
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:44,446
I don't know. Best take it cautious.

13
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:52,386
-We could go around.
-Why, everytime that old hag of yours gets skiddish?

14
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,236
Why don't you put a martingale on
him?

15
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,315
We'll just go easy.

16
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,436
Chances are, if they was, they
would have rode out on us.

17
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:42,291
Chances are, if they was, they
would have rode out on us.

18
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:47,922
Yeah, something like that.

19
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,660
This ain't no country to be set afoot.

20
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:55,978
Man gets hung.

21
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,424
Are we far enough away from that
human fruit to suit you?

22
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,413
Dick! Come on out.

23
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:31,238
-Three men coming this way.
-Three?

24
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:35,098
-Well, what are they Hank?
- Is that all you seen?

25
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:40,264
Ain't but three.

26
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,999
No, there ain't no one here going to
do a little hard riding tonight.

27
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,476
I figure we'll wait on this, old boys.
Right Indian?

28
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,284
I ain't running from no free-range
bums.

29
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:57,601
No, ain't no hands going to give us
trouble.

30
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,952
I figure we'll let them bed down
here, as long as they are wanting.

31
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:07,539
Joe, you and Hag might want to get
up above there. Cover it just in case.

32
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:10,785
But if it looks clear, come on down.

33
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:23,151
-We ain't taking no chances, right Dick?
-Edgar, you sit right over there like you've been.

34
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:33,718
I might need some range.

35
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,445
When ever you think it's clear.

36
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,739
Ed?

37
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:54,684
This is Dick.

38
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,257
Howdy. Where you boys heading?

39
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:58,812
-Waco.
- Waco, Texas boys.

40
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,354
-Cowhands, are you?
-That's right.

41
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:06,211
Coming from up north?

42
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,400
Yeah, been two weeks since Pea
River.

43
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,959
Long right yet to Waco.

44
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:26,054
Well now. You boys might like to
cut a little trail dust out of your necks, huh?

45
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:29,792
Why don't you step down and have
a snort with me and old Edgar.

46
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,100
Well, that puts no pale on you little boy.

47
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,613
Much obliged.

48
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:42,003
-I'm Dick and this here is Edgar.
-Vern.

49
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,359
-Wes.
-Otis.

50
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:49,404
They call me blind Dick, on account
of one eye.

51
00:13:51,532 --> 00:13:55,347
There's a whole coral down there
on the side.

52
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,459
You go on with them.

53
00:14:44,138 --> 00:14:47,908
- What outfit's the trail with?
- Crossfield, Seabard.

54
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,650
Heading back there huh?
- No.

55
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:59,354
Where? Waco.

56
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,403
Just the three of you?

57
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,258
Yeah, three's all. Five of you?

58
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:19,624
-Run into any coyotes up around the Pea?
- Two or three. Signs mostly.

59
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:51,694
Was just telling Otice and Vern here
how Adam fell on his knife and
that's what wrong with him.

60
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:58,895
-Have a snort
- Obliged.

61
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:28,957
-You boys are welcome to some of these vittles.
- Obliged.

62
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:34,466
These men are going to bed down
for the night, Edgar.

63
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,522
Come on in boys.

64
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:54,781
I want you to meet, Otis, Vern and
ahhhh..Wes. Joe and Boise.

65
00:16:56,903 --> 00:17:01,288
Did you get any boys? Huh?
Critters.

66
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,676
No, no, we didn't get any.

67
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,192
A few droppings, that's all we seen.

68
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:12,935
-Well beans and biscuits is it.
-That'll be fine, thank-you.

69
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:41,492
They is a bunch on a scout, if I've
ever seen any.

70
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:46,336
-Ain't no five ever rode out alive out of that shack.
- We could run for it.

71
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:52,625
What for? They don't want no
trouble and we don't want no trouble.

72
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,639
How about "fell on his knife".

73
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:03,257
Yeah, that's a lou-lou.

74
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:07,772
No, they figure we are just
cowhands passing through, that's
all.

75
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:10,275
We are.

76
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,092
They won't start nothing.

77
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:21,256
They seen us coming sure. They
could have picked us off easy, if they wanted to.

78
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:27,657
Hunting rabbits, ain't that one?

79
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:37,215
-Maybe you want to try and bring them in?
- Maybe you do Vern?

80
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,905
-It'll be light enough tomorrow.
-I'm ready right now.

81
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:28,006
North up around Wardello would be
good for us.

82
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:32,664
-They know we ain't no cowhands.
-You're too worried boys.

83
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,170
I'd have picked them off original.

84
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,799
They don't want no trouble. Going
to Waco, that's all they are.

85
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:54,797
-Make up a pretty good mess of beans.
-I didn't mind it.

86
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:58,293
Maybe you two ought to throw in
with this bunch.

87
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:01,961
Sure is a softer line than what I've
got.

88
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:07,745
Except I ain't anxious to wind up
trimming a tree, like the one we seen.

89
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:11,632
I'll be pleased to part company
myself.

90
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:18,574
Think we ought to put a watch on
them?

91
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:21,465
No, we'll leave early.

92
00:20:21,774 --> 00:20:26,004
You'd think they'd do something for
that Adam.

93
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:31,514
-What they gonna do?
-Wonder if this spread's got any riders up this way?

94
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:35,405
They'll be lightening out just like us
tomorrow.

95
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:56,837
-You gonna hook up in Seabar again?
- I don't know.

96
00:20:57,345 --> 00:21:01,543
-I was wondering....
- It's a good outfit.

97
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:05,120
-How about you Wes?
- No.

98
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,713
-Down to Cain?
-Maybe.

99
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:16,419
-Didn't seem much to me.
- That's the way you seen it Vern.

100
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:31,489
Ever think about trying for a spread
of your own?

101
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:36,535
Once or twice.

102
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:42,319
-You never get nothing growing.
-I've been doing it awile now.
Sounds like you want to squat.

103
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,636
-You ought to throw in with this bunch Wes.
-You do all the riding you want.

104
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:51,064
-Better than being afoot.
-He's got one there.

105
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:56,995
Don't seem crazy to me.

106
00:21:57,272 --> 00:22:03,202
You start now Wes and you'd have something.
- I know it ain't crazy.

107
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:11,599
I'm going to think about it, as soon
as we get out of here tomorrow.

108
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:39,619
Do you know what's close by?

109
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:43,781
Sierra Junction is a day or two south.

110
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,870
Sierra Junction? Is that the one I mean.

111
00:22:47,103 --> 00:22:49,798
Got a place called "Golden Nugget"
in there?

112
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:53,693
What don't? It's either the "Golden
Nugget" or the "Silver Dollar"....

113
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:57,923
...every place between here and
Rosie's Canteena.

114
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,128
You fixing to stop off?

115
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:03,246
I was wondering if it was the one.

116
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,562
You got something in there?

117
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:11,729
Mention a saloon and you start to
dancing around.

118
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,893
I ain't even going to get started with
you this morning, Vern.

119
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,168
-Bout ready to head out, are they?

120
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,370
Yeah. Anytime now.

121
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:29,724
I don't know.

122
00:24:31,157 --> 00:24:34,698
-Are they still there?
-Yeah.

123
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:39,439
You think them fools would be
bound......

124
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,115
All right! You're surrounded.

125
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,969
Don't make trouble for yourselves.
You got no chance.

126
00:24:57,324 --> 00:25:01,178
-What'll we do Dick?
-We'll have to make our play right here.

127
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:02,866
What do you want with us?

128
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,375
I guess they'll hang us.

129
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:10,734
Throw out your weapons, and come
on out now or we'll open fi re.

130
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,586
You got no chance.

131
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,960
We won't wait forever.

132
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,316
We'll open fire on three.

133
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:40,633
One.....

134
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:46,113
Two......

135
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:31,001
Don't go slow. Keep the other three
pinned down and concentrate on the shack.

136
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:14,984
-We got to get out.
-How?

137
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:23,109
Hills are our only chance.

138
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:30,125
-Where do they go anyhow, on foot?
- It's all we got.

139
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:35,517
Going to be a long day.

140
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:38,451
-You want to try and ride through them?
-We'll use the horses to get us into the hills.

141
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:50,783
We're just sitting here waiting to get
shot, or hung.

142
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:59,610
-What are they doing?
- Running back and forth looks like.

143
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,325
Ain't going nowhere with that.

144
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:06,822
Hold fire.

145
00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:11,414
They ain't going anywhere up there.

146
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:19,462
We gotta get the rest of them
smoked out before dark.

147
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:26,367
Sam, try and get up above the
shack. Ward take some of your
bunch and track the two that went up the canyon.

148
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:31,058
Now don't take chances. Just track
them. They're killers.

149
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:07,519
Save it.

150
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:36,928
-I hope they follow us.
-Not me.

151
00:33:37,402 --> 00:33:38,783
We wasn't doing nothing.

152
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:43,722
What's the matter with you?

153
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:48,346
-Nothing's the matter. Come on
-Where to?

154
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:59,096
I don't give a damn Wes. They'll
hang you just the same with Otis dead.

155
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,919
Hold your fi re.

156
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,401
Throw down your guns and come
out.

157
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:03,683
You have no chance. There's men
above you.

158
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,378
We're going to burn you out.

159
00:35:09,394 --> 00:35:11,586
What do you say?

160
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:19,636
All right. Your last chance.

161
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:56,257
Don't shoot. I'm coming out.

162
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,233
Got anything to say?

163
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:16,074
No?

164
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,552
We can't just keep going up.

165
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:46,869
We got to get down of f here.

166
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:53,344
I know the vigilantes know that.

167
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:59,039
They ain't playing Wes. They
burned them all out.

168
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:02,203
Probably strung up by now.

169
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:05,748
They know we can't get over this.

170
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:13,417
I'm not going to hang Vern.

171
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:23,829
What do they think? Burn them out!
No chances.

172
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:27,988
They figured we couldn't get over
this, so we'd come to them.

173
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:29,533
Just like the others done.

174
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:33,382
Probably marking a trail behind us.

175
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:38,548
Most of them are probably down at
that necktie party for awhile.

176
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:45,368
We gotta try to go around them, or
through them.

177
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:29,110
-You all right.
-Did you see them?

178
00:41:30,116 --> 00:41:34,161
Must be only three or four up here.
Come on then.

179
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:51,732
Get on down and tell Quint that they're moving west
across the face and that you think you winged one
of them. And we'll just stay low until they box themselves in.

180
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:55,813
It's going to begin to get chilly up
here in a couple of hours.

181
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,386
-Supper Pa.
-Thank you. Tell your mother I'll be
along.

182
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:50,703
-Good evening Catherine.
-Evan.

183
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,582
We thank you Lord for this food.

184
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:13,356
Your humble servants and we are
grateful for this food. Amen.

185
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:44,461
It's very good. Tasty.

186
00:45:02,155 --> 00:45:06,386
My feet. I'm afraid to look at them.

187
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:12,095
We got to keep going Wes. They
track us easy in daylight, out in the open.

188
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,755
I can't walk much further.

189
00:45:25,278 --> 00:45:31,669
They was up all night, I figure. The
way they bush-whacked us this morning.

190
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:36,604
We get some horses and I think
we're out of it Vern.

191
00:45:37,611 --> 00:45:42,544
-If there was a town around here......
- We can't go into no town.

192
00:45:42,736 --> 00:45:50,399
I know. But if there's a town nearby,
there's got to be nesters or a small
ranch or something.

193
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:54,138
You figure we lost them?

194
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,002
I figure we got to fi nd a place to
hide before the sun comes up
tomorrow and this ain't it.

195
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,389
Be a shame to do all this walking
for nothing.

196
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:20,075
Your one day ahead of the game
already. Better blisters than neck
burns. Come on.

197
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:49,096
Hello inside. Can we have a word
with you?

198
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:53,876
-Stay here.
-Be careful.

199
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:11,217
-What can I do for you? - We are part of the
Citizens Vigilant Committe neighbor. You seen
anything peculiar out here?

200
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:16,845
-No, you two are the only things I
seen today besides my family and a skunk.
-There are two killers lose out here.

201
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:20,773
They're part of a gang. Got all of
them, but these two, and strung them up today.

202
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,971
-Headed this way?
- No telling.

203
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:26,747
They're on foot. One might be
wounded.

204
00:47:27,022 --> 00:47:31,680
-All right if we take a look at your stable there?
- Step down.

205
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:39,660
-Can I offer you men coffee? I got a
jug of corn-whiskey inside.
- That'd be fine, thank-you, after we look around.

206
00:47:39,855 --> 00:47:41,466
Abigail!

207
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:45,597
Bring out the corn-whiskey.

208
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:21,206
Thank-you Abby.

209
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:32,029
-This is my daughter Abigail.
-Good-evening Miss.

210
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:51,187
I guess they ain't here.

211
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:10,956
-Would you care to come inside?
-Well no thank-you. We'll go along now.

212
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,428
We got to track these birds down.
Obliged for the drink.

213
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:20,006
A pleasure meeting you Miss.

214
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:50,653
-Cute little piece, wasn't she Roy?
-Ain't nothing wrong with her.

215
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:54,305
I'll be getting back this way, I
believe.

216
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:54,964
Don't make a sound, hear me?

217
00:50:55,747 --> 00:50:57,280
Sit down.

218
00:51:07,308 --> 00:51:14,543
You just sit there, real quiet and
you'll be fine.

219
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:20,217
We don't aim to hurt nobody.

220
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:48,381
Pardon me. We are chowing down.
Well, you see, we ain't eat since yesterday morning.

221
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:55,169
This is good.

222
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:04,341
-May I prepare the food?
-Sure.

223
00:52:16,677 --> 00:52:20,832
Good for our sakes, we came by
last night.

224
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:27,418
-What's the matter?
- Nothing.

225
00:52:28,509 --> 00:52:35,436
I was just rying to figure out what
way to run?

226
00:52:35,716 --> 00:52:39,486
-Would you like some coffee?
-Much obliged.

227
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:50,581
That's a pretty big stump out there.

228
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:57,521
-What's funny?
-Nothing.

229
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:09,663
-When's he come in?
- Abigail fetches him for dinner.

230
00:53:09,976 --> 00:53:14,054
-When's that usual?
-When the grubs ready, that's all.

231
00:53:18,301 --> 00:53:25,425
-They track us here, we ain't got a chance.
- This is going to be a long enough
day, without you going on.

232
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:32,635
-I think we should take the horses now.
-Those vigilantes are spread out all over this country.

233
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,211
It's ready, the food's ready.

234
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:44,656
-She goes on out huh?
-That's what she usually does.

235
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:52,011
-Well sure, you do what you done before, that'd be fine.
-Abby, do like they say.

236
00:53:56,223 --> 00:53:58,918
Your mother will be in here with us.

237
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:14,597
She's there.

238
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,770
-Dinner Pa. Thank-you Abby.
- Tell your mother, I'll be along.

239
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:26,659
-She's coming back.
-You sit right there ma'm.

240
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:34,376
-You did fine.
-I forgot the wash-up.

241
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:37,072
- He always washes up.
-Abby!

242
00:54:38,037 --> 00:54:40,843
-Yes Pa.
-Where's my wash-up?

243
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:42,615
Tell him you'll get it.

244
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:49,243
I'm sorry Pa. I'll get it.

245
00:54:49,984 --> 00:54:53,480
What's gointg on inside there with
you women?

246
00:54:54,763 --> 00:54:56,724
Quick!

247
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:27,779
-What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry Pa, I forgot.

248
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:01,735
Don't move.

249
00:56:07,986 --> 00:56:12,108
-Got something?
- I'm done with the, all night.

250
00:56:12,341 --> 00:56:15,727
-It might be all day.
- Yeah, most of us are.

251
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:21,011
-They might not have come out of those mountains.
-Well, what do you want to do?`

252
00:56:21,551 --> 00:56:23,085
What are you going to do?

253
00:56:23,286 --> 00:56:28,174
Well they didn't come out between
here and the narrows, then they're
not coming out or....

254
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:31,148
They got over. Slipped past us.

255
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:34,381
Think I'll ride on ahead to them
squaters and get a meal.

256
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,765
Roy told me about that "meal".

257
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:44,980
-I join you when I catch up. Is that all right with you?
- Sure, the shape you're in, you ain't
seeing nothing. We'll all pack in after the day.

258
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,565
Adios.

259
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:52,764
-Aren't you going to eat Evan?
-What do you want with us?

260
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,775
Nothing. Just don't want to make
trouble.

261
00:56:56,968 --> 00:57:01,199
-Listen Mister. We didn't do nothing.
-You're horse thieves.

262
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,938
You know that. You can't just come
in here and take my stock.

263
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,643
What'll I have. How will I work?

264
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:15,767
-I'm going out to look at the horses.
-What for?

265
00:57:16,238 --> 00:57:19,197
-I want to see them.
-What if someone comes riding by?

266
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,622
They ain't going to see me.

267
00:57:21,864 --> 00:57:24,716
You keep him in here and I'll take
her out with me.

268
00:57:24,716 --> 00:57:27,796
-What for?
-What do you want with her? Don't
think I'm him.

269
00:57:27,992 --> 00:57:31,181
-This ain't no social Wes.
-You said it was.

270
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,034
All right, I won't take her. No, go
ahead and take her.

271
00:57:45,064 --> 00:57:48,802
All I'm doing is looking at your
horses.

272
00:57:53,543 --> 00:58:00,360
That's all Mister. I understand how
you feel.

273
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:04,600
We ain't outlaws. We ain't!

274
00:58:04,835 --> 00:58:09,679
You just sit tight a couple of hours,
and then we'll be gone.

275
00:58:10,384 --> 00:58:14,276
Don't make no trouble, is what's
best for all of us.

276
00:58:50,657 --> 00:58:52,575
Not bad animals.

277
00:59:01,602 --> 00:59:04,298
You don't say much.

278
00:59:12,855 --> 00:59:16,275
I was getting a little cabin fever

279
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:25,456
-You like it here?
- Can we go in?

280
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:31,585
My father don't like it if I talk to
strangers.

281
00:59:31,585 --> 00:59:34,511
He don't mean nothing to me.

282
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:45,684
-They're going to hang us. You think that's right?
- I don't know. It ain't up to me.

283
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:51,817
You just do what? What's right with
your Pa? Is that all you care about?

284
00:59:52,049 --> 00:59:54,515
I can't say.

285
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:07,344
-How old are you?
-18, I reckon.

286
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:12,812
-You wanting to steal our stock.
-That's ain't my problem.

287
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:17,716
-Tell them vigilantes, they're the ones.
- It's the wrong thing to do.

288
01:00:17,716 --> 01:00:26,298
What's right? Hang? You tell me.
They killed the best friend I ever had.

289
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:35,317
We ought to go in.

290
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:43,913
When I say, is when I want to go in.

291
01:00:58,913 --> 01:01:01,643
You going to eat that?

292
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:29,123
-Pretty good horses.
- As long as they get us out of this part of the country.

293
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:34,637
-You go out and beat that old stump
to death, then I won't have to hear it.
- I want to stay in here.

294
01:01:34,947 --> 01:01:40,373
Go out. Don't mean no trouble.
Look better if you out there working.

295
01:01:45,738 --> 01:01:48,511
Don't worry about them.

296
01:02:16,222 --> 01:02:21,308
-He sure is on the tick.
-Sure he's on the peck.

297
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:25,075
Stealing horses is all we mean to
him. Can't blame him.

298
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:31,324
-You mind if I get some sleep Vern?
-Go on.

299
01:02:33,872 --> 01:02:38,959
-This is my bed.
- No, go on.

300
01:03:01,582 --> 01:03:04,925
-How long has he been going at
that stump?

301
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:09,249
-Yesterday morning.
-You like it here?

302
01:03:10,638 --> 01:03:12,710
It's all right.

303
01:03:15,032 --> 01:03:20,041
-Kind of lonesome for a woman.
-Same as for a man.

304
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,888
-I reckon.

305
01:03:26,979 --> 01:03:30,826
Seems to me what you do is
lonesome.

306
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:37,844
I guess you'd be right. I don't know.

307
01:03:40,968 --> 01:03:46,207
That man last night, said they
hanged some of your bunch.

308
01:03:49,023 --> 01:03:54,109
-It ain't my bunch ma'm.
-What are you going to do Vern, talk?

309
01:03:56,422 --> 01:03:59,841
Ah, you can go to sleep. Beats me
anyways.

310
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,086
Well I guess I can't.

311
01:04:06,596 --> 01:04:09,063
If you ladies got anything to do, you
go on.

312
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:37,185
Hey Wes, what was that with you
and Cain?

313
01:04:40,202 --> 01:04:47,447
-Damn, what do you want to do, talk is all?
- Better than sitting here all day listening to myself.

314
01:04:47,447 --> 01:04:52,456
I don't know. You want to play
checkers?

315
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:58,314
-You got any checkers.
- Yes we do.

316
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:01,582
Can we use them?

317
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:29,984
-Playing checkers.....Stealing horses.....
-What's the matter with you?

318
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:35,541
-Just don't seem to be no end to it.
- No use to that.

319
01:05:35,813 --> 01:05:42,247
-Strikes me as peculiar just the same.
- Why's that?

320
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:47,675
Sitting here, playing checkers.

321
01:05:47,953 --> 01:05:52,346
While there is a bunch of men out
there, looking to string us up.

322
01:05:52,346 --> 01:05:58,386
-Why don't you put a tune to it?
-We're in the scout boy.

323
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:03,169
You can't cash in, can you?

324
01:06:03,638 --> 01:06:06,520
Getting strung up is better?

325
01:06:07,299 --> 01:06:10,412
Nobody is just going to put a name
to me, and that's it.

326
01:06:20,633 --> 01:06:24,678
I'd like to take a whack at that
stump myself.

327
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:29,027
Come on. Play!

328
01:06:42,446 --> 01:06:45,712
I don't know. I'm going to think
about it.

329
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:48,607
You'll never get nothing growing.

330
01:06:49,229 --> 01:06:52,923
This is the less work I done on a
weekday, since I was four.

331
01:06:53,121 --> 01:06:55,313
Unelss I was sick.

332
01:06:55,626 --> 01:06:58,892
-What's so funny?
-They ain't playing Wes.

333
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:01,248
They burned down my house.

334
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,450
-It's your move Vern.
-I know it.

335
01:07:08,228 --> 01:07:13,117
-You're horse thieves.
- Indians?

336
01:07:15,127 --> 01:07:18,130
-Well come on, play.
- Where you been at Vern?

337
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:21,089
I moved already.

338
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:35,548
He stopped. See what he's doing.

339
01:07:35,745 --> 01:07:41,478
No, we ain't found them ain't.
Probably won't if we don't get them today.

340
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:46,257
-Where's your women folk?
- Inside. Baking today.

341
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:49,617
Baking? That right?

342
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:59,245
Well I out scouting. The main body
is moving out this way.

343
01:07:59,485 --> 01:08:02,027
What the hell they talking about Vern.

344
01:08:02,568 --> 01:08:04,946
Well the side buster is spilling his beans.

345
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:08,576
-Something the matter with you?
-No.

346
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:12,662
You're acting mighty peculiar for
nothing the matter.

347
01:08:15,054 --> 01:08:18,748
-They're here!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

348
01:08:18,908 --> 01:08:21,604
-Where're they at? In the house?
-They got the women. What are we going to do?

349
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:24,176
Now, you don't look at the house.

350
01:08:24,496 --> 01:08:28,967
You start pointing off behind me.
I'm just going to ease out of here and get some help.

351
01:08:28,967 --> 01:08:32,858
Act like you're giving me directions
to some place, like I'm just passing through.

352
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,702
You just go on back to work, like it
was nothing.

353
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:39,213
Make them come out to you to fi nd
out what happened.

354
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,916
Stall them.

355
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:47,769
-We going to leave him go?
-Well, ain't no other way.

356
01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:54,318
Doing us a favor. Getting dumb-
enough to go for whatever it is.

357
01:08:55,057 --> 01:08:58,323
As soon as he's out of sight.

358
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,029
Stay inside.

359
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:09,847
Come on, let's go.

360
01:09:15,174 --> 01:09:17,059
Hey, stay out of there.

361
01:09:29,935 --> 01:09:32,357
They're taking our stock.

362
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:44,155
Hold it right there!

363
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:57,641
-What do you think?
-Take two men and fi nd out. It
could be anything.

364
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:45,475
-We're sorry about this ma'm.
- I hope you hang them.

365
01:11:45,475 --> 01:11:48,095
Don't worry. They've
seen their last sunrise.

366
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:51,592
-One of them is shot.
-They won't get far now.

367
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:41,929
-Let me down.
-No we can't Vern.

368
01:13:44,597 --> 01:13:46,975
I ain't going.

369
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:55,883
Two won't make it on that horse.

370
01:13:58,086 --> 01:14:04,630
I bought it, Wes. Go on.

371
01:14:05,678 --> 01:14:12,222
-I can't just leave you.
- You have to do that boy. Can't you see that?

372
01:14:13,193 --> 01:14:15,462
Go on!

373
01:16:00,831 --> 01:16:02,519
We got them now.

374
01:17:19,989 --> 01:17:22,367
What about the other one?

375
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:32,965
