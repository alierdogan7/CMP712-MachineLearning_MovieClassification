168
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,956
...but you gotta lend me
one of your deputies.

169
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,935
- Let me guess. It's not Ferg.
- Nope.

170
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,630
I want that feisty Italian.

171
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,140
Be careful what you wish for.

172
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,019
Well, what a surprise.

173
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,324
Pam! Guess who's here.

174
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,051
- You got a minute to talk?
- Sure.

175
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,390
I'm assuming this is about Ed.
What'd he do?

176
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,296
He got mauled to death by a bear.

177
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,829
I can't believe it.

178
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,838
- A bear?
- Your brother gave this as his address.

179
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,569
- Was he staying with you?
- Yeah.

180
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,576
He really didn't have no other options.

181
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,408
He was only supposed to stay a week.

182
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,083
Two weeks later, no job, no apartment.

183
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,345
- You didn't want Ed staying here?
- Guy is a criminal.

184
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,855
Best thing that ever happened to Pam
and her folks was Ed going to prison.

185
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:12,695
So either of you have any idea
what Ed was doing in the woods?

186
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,257
I don't know.

187
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,392
He wasn't too interested
in hiking or the outdoors.

188
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,165
Last I saw of him
he was going on a job interview.

189
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,706
Said he got a lead
from one of his prison buddies.

190
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,701
This prison buddy,
Ed give you a name?

191
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,710
I didn't ask for one.

192
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,645
To be honest, I thought
the whole job thing was bullshit.

193
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,114
I figured he was getting high
or something.

194
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,255
- Was Ed using drugs?
- No.

195
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,481
He was scary when he was using.

196
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,218
I didn't see none of that
when he was here.

197
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,725
RUSSELL:
Damn it!

198
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,024
I let him borrow my old Tacoma
for that job interview.

199
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,134
- Did you find it?
- I'm sorry, no.

200
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,293
If you give me a description of it...

201
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,965
...we'll do our best to find it for you.
- Even dead he's a pain in my ass.

202
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,736
I'll get you a copy of my registration.

203
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,282
Sorry about Russell.
He's been pretty upset lately.

204
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,079
They cut his hours way back.

205
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:13,089
Plus, he didn't know the good Ed
from before.

206
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,821
He was such a sweet little kid.

207
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,265
I can't believe he's gone.

208
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,905
I understand.

209
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,234
Now, apart from the buddy from prison...

210
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,276
...Ed hook up with any old friends
that you know of?

211
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,413
All his old friends are dead or in jail.

212
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,414
- What about enemies?
RUSSELL: Enemies?

213
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,211
Ed?

214
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,251
What about the parents of that girl
he killed?

215
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,475
- Hey, Walt.
- Ruby.

216
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,206
Oh, Branch left this for you.

217
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,850
Records on Ed Crawley's murder trial.

218
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,852
He also had me call down to the state
penitentiary to have the warden...

219
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,514
...send over a list of all the men
he's been locked up with.

220
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,354
- Thank you, Ruby.
- Mm-hm.

221
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,895
When you talk to Branch next,
could you let him know...

222
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,226
...I need a little background
on Russell Gray.

223
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,960
- Crawley's brother-in-law.
- Russell Gray.

224
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,533
WALT:
Ferg, what are you doing?

225
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,540
Sheriff Connally wanted to help out
with the investigation.

226
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,042
He's no longer the sheriff.
He's under arrest...

227
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,237
...pending assault charges
from the home.

228
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,507
Our investigation isn't his business.

229
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,548
You see the mark on that boy's ankles?

230
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,516
- He was restrained.
- I saw it, Lucien.

231
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,915
LUCIEN:
He was a druggie too!

232
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,647
WALT:
We did find some crystal meth...

233
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,190
...and possible
injection marks on Crawley's legs.

234
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,191
But we won't know until the autopsy...

235
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,523
...and get a tox screen.
- Who you looking at?

236
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,164
- Everybody.
- Oh, come on, Walt.

237
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,233
Ferg. Victim was last seen
in his brother-in-law's Tacoma.

238
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,699
Here's the registration.
I want you to find it.

239
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,805
- On it.
- What about my no-good nephew?

240
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,440
Why ain't he helping here?

241
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,839
I am helping. I'm bringing our
pain-in-the-ass prisoner his tacos.

242
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,948
Ruby, I need you to find me an address.
Donna and Ira Craig.

243
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,744
- Who's Donna and Ira Craig?
- None of your business.

244
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,682
Hey, Walt.

245
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,115
BRANCH:
You owe me 6.95 plus tip.

246
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,768
Victim was found down that path,
about a mile or so.

247
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,969
You make a habit of leering
at married women so blatantly?

248
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,603
Well, first of all, yes.

249
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,541
And secondly,
I had no idea you were married.

250
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,483
You don't seem domesticated.

251
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,147
You really think you wanna talk to me
like that when I'm holding this?

252
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,728
I just don't know
why you don't wear a ring.

253
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,923
- At least Waffles wears a collar.
- Who's Waffles?

254
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,762
The killer bear. Name's Waffles.

255
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:15,566
And they put a tracking collar on her
a year ago so they could study her.

256
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,067
I tracked her online.

257
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:21,804
It's pretty handy,
but it sure takes the fun out of hunting.

258
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,575
We're supposed to be trapping the bear,
not hunting it.

259
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,274
OMAR:
Well, that's the idea.

260
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,511
But we gotta be ready
for the possibility...

261
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,587
...Waffles won't go along with our plan.

262
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:36,160
But don't worry, Vicky.
Omar'll protect you.

264
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,662
- Are we supposed to feel bad?
- No.

265
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,861
No, it seemed like something
you might like to know.

266

You have any children, Sheriff Longmire?

267
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,108
- Yes, I do. I have a daughter.
- Oh, well, this is our daughter.

268
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,302
- Honey...
- Blair.

269
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,710
She should be 37 years old right now.

IRA:
An artist's projection of how she'd look.

271
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,953
We have one painted every year
on her birthday.

272
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,621
That's all we have left of her.

273
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,787
After Ed Crawley stabbed her 12 times.

274
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,189
His lawyers said
he wasn't in his right mind...

275
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,621
...because of the drugs.

276
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,062
But a human being does not stab
a 17-year-old girl 12 times.

277
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,828
Drugs or no drugs.
No, Ed Crawley was a monster.

278
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,994
- Honey, let it go.
- If it were up to me...

279
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,732
...he would have been swinging
from a rope years ago.

280
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,377
What is the point of capital punishment
if we can't use it?

281

IRA:
You've gotta understand.

282
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:33,082
The last 20 years, we've been
working to keep Blair's killer in prison.

283
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,380
We write letters,
we show up at his parole hearings.

284
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,353
If you don't mind,
when did you last see the victim?

285
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,825
Victim? Now he's the victim?

286
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,527
IRA:
We were at his last parole hearing.

287
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,156
- You have any contact with him?
- Yes, sheriff. We yelled. We cursed.

288
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
Made our feelings known.
And still, they released him.

289
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,065
It took a bear to do what the so-called
justice system should've done.

290
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,437
The hearing was a sham.

291
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,511
The new warden didn't know the case.

292
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,274
If the old warden, Dan Blackburn,
had been there...

293
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,112
...he would have convinced that board
to keep that animal in prison.

294
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,414
What's gonna happen with the bear?

295
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,288
Depends. Could be relocated.
Could be put down.

- Walt, arrest him.

- That what they told you?
- They say they're relatives.

I'm sorry, but Donna wanted
to see the body.

I thought maybe it might provide
her some kind of closure.

- I thought Crawley was killed by a bear.
- Yeah.

That's the thing. He was.

385
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,070
But he was in restraints at the time
and I think the bear was baited.

You had a lot of contact with the Craigs

Donna lost it.

Like he'd already had his closure.

I can't remember Crawley's

As for the Craigs, I can certainly
sympathize with how they felt...

...seeing the guy who killed
their daughter walking free.

...it would've made a difference.
- Not really.

Crawley's prison record
did look awfully clean.

404
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,858
Yes, it was. But a lot of guys thought
Crawley stabbed and killed a guard.

- Record said he was exonerated on that.
- Yeah.

Another inmate took credit for it.

Then again, he was a lifer.
He had nothing to lose.

408

him off with cartons...

- Mail. That's a clever system.
- Yeah.

496
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,621
Lace meth in the greeting cards.

497
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,828
Prisoners just chew it up and get high.

498
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,729
If the meth house we raided
provided it to the prison...

499
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,735
Someone in that house must have
a connection to the prison.

500
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,874
- And a connection to Ed Crawley.
VIC: Hey, guys, look...

501
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,874
- You should be in bed.
- No, seriously, you gotta see this.

502
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,912
BRANCH: What do they have you on?
- This is where the dart hit me.

503
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:30,318
This is from a syringe. The dart, syringe.

504
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,517
Ed Crawley's holes looked like this.

505
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,158
Not like this.

506
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:39,763
- Ed Crawley wasn't shooting up drugs.
- He was shot with a tranquilizer dart.

Any of these prisoners strike you
as sophisticated enough to plan either...

511
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,443
...a meth-smuggling operation
or an elaborate murder?

512
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,678
This guy, Steven Kane.
He acted as his own lawyer.

- No.

This murder was brutal.

Tie meat to a man,
have a bear have eat him.

516
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,528
That's torture. Torture is vengeance.

517
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,193
Vengeance is your motive.

518
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,266
Crawley's brother-in-law
doesn't have much of an alibi.

519
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,409
He's a licensed hunter, so is Ira Craig.

520
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,942
That dude's definitely
a candidate for vengeance.

FERG:
"Stonesifer"?

524
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,386
A guard named Jerry Stonesifer signed
some of these release forms.

525
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,583
Same as the woman
who owns the meth house.

526
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,160
He was a prison guard.
He would've known Crawley.

527
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,593
Maybe Crawley's prison buddy
wasn't a prisoner.

528
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,823
WALT:
But a prison guard.

529
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,628
And then Crawley's car
ends up at the aunt's house.

530
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,067
That's about four too many
coincidences for me.

He was resisting arrest.

before you departed in February.

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,764

to smuggle meth into the state prison?

He persuaded Snowcap Vista
to take you back.

Now, how did he do that?

548
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:51,161
Apparently, he found several code
violations he threatened to report...

549
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,956
...unless they let you back in.

...and the lengths my family'd go
to get rid of me.

- I don't trust Branch.

I think most of my important secrets
are kept deep enough.

So, what'd you used to do
when a suspect wouldn't talk to you?

559
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,691
- Simple. I'd whup his ass till he did talk.
- Ha, ha.

Well, we can't do that these days.

Vic by accident.

If you were out there trying
to tranquilize a bear...

...you'd use a bigger dosage.

But the bear was just a weapon.
You guys killed him.

Stonesifer called up Ed Crawley,
told him about a job.

When he arrived,
you shot him with tranquilizer darts...

...then tied him to a tree
with meat on him...

617

00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,944
But I didn't go quietly.

661
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:29,081
I'm a guy who didn't sit there and do
nothing while a murderer walked free.

662
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,750
My friend got death.

663
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,887
The Craigs got a lifetime sentence
of never seeing their daughter again...

664
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,123
...because of Crawley.

665
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:41,794
And if that son of a bitch gets torn apart
by a bear, limb to limb...

666
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:47,103
...I will watch that movie.
By God, I'll go back and see it again.

667
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,768
This ain't a movie.

668
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,141
We can't be torturing
and murdering people...

669
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,215
...no matter how right we think we are.

670
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:59,719
Somebody's gotta be the sheriff,
or else we're all just animals.

671
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,223
What the world needs
is more human beings.

673
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,825
Now, Waffles,
technically after three strikes...

674
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,302
...we're supposed to shoot you.

675
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:20,639
We humans have this thing
called entrapment.

676
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,838
Now, it's hard to explain,
but you just promise...

677
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:29,111
...that you'll stay as far away
from town as you can.

678
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,283
Okay, then.
