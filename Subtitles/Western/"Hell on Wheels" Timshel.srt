00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:12,281
Are you saying...

183
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:15,453
I want you to be mine.

184
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,579
None other.

185
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,758
Man:
Ferguson, you in there?

186
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:36,847
Elam Ferguson, come on out here.

187
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:42,611
You...
You son of a bitch.

188
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:44,021
Mercy.

189
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:47,140
On the immaculate heart
of the sweet virgin herself,

190
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,193
I pray for mercy.

191
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,153
And I beg you to hear me out.

192
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:04,032
You shot me straight
in me gob, Mr. Ferguson.

193
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:09,036
A shot that would
any man to his grave,

194
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,906
but praise the mother's son,

195
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:18,412
at the last second...
An angel reached out...

196
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:23,894
And she flicked
the bullet out of me neck.

197
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:27,231
I tell you, it's true.

198
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,860
It's the reason
I kneel before you now.

199
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:36,062
Let me show you.
Let me show you the hole.

200
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:38,325
Please, Mr. Ferguson.

201
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:44,360
Bear witness to a miracle.

202
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:50,843
As I wandered in the wilderness,

203
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:53,132
like our lord himself...

204
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:59,055
I came face to face with me
ignorance and cruelty towards you.

205
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:06,023
And I swore to God almighty
that if I survived,

206
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:08,826
I would come to you on bended knee

207
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:12,568
and beg for your forgiveness.

208
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:17,823
Not me.

209
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,495
Her.

210
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,067
Come on out here.

211
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:41,430
You tell her you're sorry.

212
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,685
I'm sorry, Lass.

213
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,107
Sorry as the sorriest sinner.

214
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,569
I should not have harmed you such.

215
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,030
All right, then.

216
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:06,203
Elam: Go on and git.

217
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:33,440
Man: Black Moon.
Come down.

218
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:35,230
It's your father.

219
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:41,949
Father, you're safe.

220
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:44,549
I come looking for Pawnee killer.

221
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:47,176
Instead, I find a burial.

222
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:52,180
Have you nothing to tell me?

223
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:58,966
I came to do it myself.

224
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:08,767
Go.

225
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,306
Climb up.

226
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:12,980
Let's complete the ceremony.

227
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,485
Step right this way,
lads, and get an eyeful.

228
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:21,280
See the loveliest creatures

229
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,220
from the bluest streets of Paris,
France. Hey.

230
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:28,190
See soiled doves bare all.

231
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:29,391
You been gone.

232
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:31,794
Took the train to Chicago.

233
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,929
Whew, what a town.

234
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:35,502
Jeez.

235
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:38,299
Looks like you brought a bit
of Chicago back with you.

236
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:40,424
Indeed.

237
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,926
Do you want to take a peek?

238
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,640
[Whistling and hollering]

239
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,561
On the house, of course.

240
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,396
Anything for Mr. Bohannon.

241
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,482
[Men whistling]

242
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,651
Ah. Thanks.

243
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,322
Hold on.

244
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,449
Sean would like a word with you.

245
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,595
Looks like you been
doing some business, hmm?

246
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,529
Aye, we're packin' 'em
in like sardines.

247
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:12,998
How'd you pay for the extra slides?

248
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,000
Win another fight or somethin'?

249
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,936
[Whistling and hollering
in background]

250
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,754
Yeah.

251
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:25,469
'Course, the, uh...
The Swede will want his pound of flesh.

252
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,472
He takes a cut?

253
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,391
And then some.

254
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,352
What you want me
to do about it, Sean?

255
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,230
Here's the thing.

256
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,901
We're not the only
ones being preyed upon.

257
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,861
All the merchants of Hell on Wheels
are payin' him off.

258
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:45,531
So...

259
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:50,661
So... we took up a collection.

260
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,071
Everybody pitched in.

261
00:22:54,196 --> 00:22:57,940
There's $100 in here... for you.

262
00:22:58,065 --> 00:23:00,796
What the hell for?

263
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,298
For killin' the Swede.

264
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,910
I ain't no gun for hire.

265
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,122
[Sighs]

266
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:15,724
All right, I tell you what...

267
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:19,148
I happen to know the Swede's
been stealing from Durant.

268
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,359
Dig you up some dirt on him,

269
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:27,259
and Durant will ride him
out of town on a rail...

270
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,243
Free.

271
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,572
[Indistinct chatter]

[Chatter stops]

273
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:10,783
Ask me to sit down.

274
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:17,607
Go on, ask me.

275
00:24:19,777 --> 00:24:21,752
Have a seat.

276
00:24:27,283 --> 00:24:29,451
[Indistinct chatter resumes]

277
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:38,977
Now... pour me a drink.

278
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:42,162
Another glass.

279
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:56,676
Your health.

280
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:04,837
[Exhales]
Tastes like shit.

281
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,730
You ain't much of
a drinking man, is you?

282
00:25:07,855 --> 00:25:09,265
Gave it up.

283
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,790
Why is that?

284
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:16,557
Last time I got drunk...
I got into somethin' bad.

285
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:24,904
Listen, I need to ask you somethin'.

286
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,984
You know that bidness
we had to attend to?

287
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:33,782
You good with that?

288
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:38,516
I'm better than good.

289
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,583
'Bout time I be the one
who gets to do the hurtin'.

290
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,221
Besides...

291
00:25:45,657 --> 00:25:49,101
Seem Mr. Durant
took a likin' to my work.

292
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:52,639
He say he might just
call on me when need be.

293
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:56,709
Durant?
Better watch yourself.

294
00:25:56,834 --> 00:26:00,100
That's a slick slope
you're headin' down.

295
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,881
Slick with blood.

296
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,908
Somebody else's, for a change.

297
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,219
For somebody who don't drink,

298
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:10,444
you're putting that down pretty good.

299
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:14,573
[Bangs]

300
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:23,468
Ladies and gentlemen...

301
00:26:23,593 --> 00:26:27,127
Take your glasses in hand for a toast

302
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:31,976
to the great Indian killers
who have made our home

303
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:34,885
a safe place to work and drink!

304
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,837
[All cheering]

305
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,524
Shut up!

306
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,238
Listen up.

307
00:26:56,556 --> 00:26:58,825
I want y'all to get
a good night's sleep.

308
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,929
Tomorrow, we hit that 40-mile marker,

309
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,530
and I'm gonna work
y'all like mongrel dogs.

310
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,878
It's gonna get built, gentlemen.

311
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,173
And we're just
the bastards to build it.

312

[All cheering]

313
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:34,931
{pub}Senator.

314
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:41,294
I am glad you were able to
witness such a momentous feat.

315
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:43,464
No, you're not.

316
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:47,165
You're only interested
in our quid pro quo.

317
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:49,169
If you insist.

318
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,896
I had the Pinkerton track down
the Illinois man you were looking for.

319
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,884
"Whereabouts
of Sergeant Frank Harper."

320
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,556
Seems he's holed up at a trading
post near council bluffs.

321
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:07,409
Your brother was
the runt of the litter.

322
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:11,732
Smaller than all the other boys.

323
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:16,595
Ah, they picked on him
and teased him.

324
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,433
He was always in a fight,
but he never backed down.

325
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:25,203
It made him strong.

326
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:28,062
It made him a great warrior.

327
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:31,699
But not a great man.

328
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,680
He never learned, as you did,

329
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:41,250
that... sometimes,
it's better not to fight,

330
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:47,213
and other times...
You must fight the ones you love.

331
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:03,325
When I saw what you were wearing...

332
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:08,372
When I saw what you had
prepared for your brother,

333
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,571
I hoped that you would return to me.

334
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,473
But now, I see in your eyes...

335
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,688
You are becoming your own man.

336
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:42,197
And so today, I mourn for one son,
Pawnee killer.

337
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:51,206
And I mourn the loss
of my other son, Black Moon...

338
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,091
Which hurts me so much more.

We're gonna make it.

343
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:38,712
Now put your backs into it.

344

Pick it up, boys!

345
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,308
I want them next two rails
laid in the next 5 minutes.

346
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,601
Pick up the pace.

We run out of flanges again,
I'll skin the runner alive!

it. Hold the spike.

00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,986
You embarrass me now, boys,
and I'll skin the lot of ya.

362
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,490
Let's go!

363
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:48,740
[Train whistle blowing]

364
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,625
[Indistinct shouting continues]

365
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,966
Hold! Down.

366
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:23,400
Last one, boys!
Last one.

367
00:32:43,102 --> 00:32:44,671
Durant:
Mr. Bohannon!

368
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:51,928
May I?

369
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,273
Ahh.

370
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:11,281
Ah.
[Crowd cheering]

371
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,075
[Laughs]

372
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,502
Congratulations.

373
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:37,194
Congratulations.
[Indistinct]

374
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,362
Congratulations.

375
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:41,655
[Cheering and applause]

376
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:28,763
{pub}Ruth?

377
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,940
I'm sorry.

378
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:37,701
You were waiting for me?

379
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:40,278
Every night.

380
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,335
Joseph, are you hurt?

381
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,920
No.

382
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,264
I killed him, Ruth.

383
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,435
[Crying]

384
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,445
I killed my own brother.

385
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,125
[Kisses]

386
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,767
[Harmonica playing]

387
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,559
[Crowd cheering]

388
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:10,605
Thanks.

389
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,898
[Indistinct chatter]

390
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:42,668
Excuse me, sir?

391
00:36:42,793 --> 00:36:44,204
Yeah?

392
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:47,664
Oh. Pardon me, ma'am.

393
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:50,276
What will you be having?

394
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:53,278
Well, um...
Champagne, perhaps?

395
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:55,905
Uh... ahem. What?

396
00:36:57,741 --> 00:37:01,094
Um... how about a glass of Sherry?

397
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,955
I love a good Sherry.

398
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,959
Ah. Brandy.

399
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,126
Fine.

400
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,461
Brandy would be fine.

401
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:12,772
It's on me.

402
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:15,967
May I?

403
00:37:16,092 --> 00:37:17,759
By all means.

404
00:37:21,764 --> 00:37:23,598
Thank you.

405
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,837
Not good?

406
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:36,552
Uh... I've had better.

407
00:37:36,677 --> 00:37:38,923
Ahh. Yeah.

408
00:37:41,115 --> 00:37:43,893
Well, you did it.
40 miles.

409
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:46,306
You said you would, and you did.

410
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:48,521
First time in my life.

411
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:50,833
Failed as a tobacco farmer,

412
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,668
lost a war...

413
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:54,469
Now I'm a railroad man.

414
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:57,692
Maybe third time's the charm, huh?

415
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:00,695
Maybe.

416
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:05,241
That first night we met, uh...

417
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:09,874
You told me I had no idea who you was
or what you was capable of, and...

418
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,087
You was right.

419
00:38:14,212 --> 00:38:16,920
Ha ha.

420
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:20,660
I thought you were some
spoiled limey brat.

421
00:38:20,785 --> 00:38:21,758
Uh.

422
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:25,803
Yeah, I guess I got you wrong, huh?

423
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:30,994
Well, what do you think
of me now, Mr. Bohannon?

424
00:38:40,838 --> 00:38:43,696
Mrs. Bell!
Mr. Bohannon!

425
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:45,083
Ahem.

426
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,283
Doing a little celebrating?

427
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:50,021
Well, you both deserve it.

428
00:38:50,146 --> 00:38:53,191
What you did today was historic.

429
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:54,692
Thank you, Thomas.

430
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:56,167
Will you join us?

431
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,097
I would love to, but, um...

432
00:38:59,222 --> 00:39:01,565
There are a few issues outstanding

433
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,883
that I need to discuss
with my foreman.

434
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:10,531
Excuse me.

435
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:40,993
Black Moon.

436
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:43,638
You in here?

437
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:45,664
Black Moon?

438
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,045
You made me a pledge.

439
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,436
You told me you would win this
war called the Union Pacific.

440
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,552
Today, you won a major battle.

441
00:39:58,677 --> 00:40:00,221
You're a man of your word.

442
00:40:00,346 --> 00:40:02,556
Thank you, sir.

443
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:07,238
I wanted to both congratulate
you and offer you a bonus.

444
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:11,898
Oh. I don't need any more money, sir.

445
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:15,468
It's not that kind
of bonus, Mr. Bohannon.

446
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:20,752
It's much more valuable than money.

447
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,837
Information.

448
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:29,427
Oh, you... you're Lieutenant Griggs
from the Calvary.

449
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,013
I heard about you.
Yeah?

450
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:36,620
Well, I heard Black Moon
was livin' in here.

451
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:39,914
You feel that Joseph led you astray?

452
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,984
He needs to be made accountable.

453
00:40:45,221 --> 00:40:49,633
You know, the Swede has been,
shall we say,

454
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,449
focused on you for some time.

455
00:40:51,694 --> 00:40:53,826
Like a hound got the scent.

456
00:40:56,098 --> 00:40:58,808
He just sent a wire

457
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:02,645
to the federal marshals
in Washington, D.C.

458
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,128
Claims he has evidence

459
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:07,423
linking you to
several murders back east.

460
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:11,487
You a family man, Lieutenant?

461
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:15,973
Do you have a wife and children?

462
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:21,121
I mean, what if...
If someone, uh...

463
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:25,650
Killed your son and scalped
your daughter and raped your wife?

464
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,819
Would you stand idly by?

465
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:31,823
They'll be coming to arrest you.

466
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:42,333
You telling me all this 'cause
you want me to run, Mr. Durant?

467
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:48,089
I'm giving you a chance
to save yourself, Bohannon.

468
00:42:03,494 --> 00:42:05,271
I don't know, could you... could you...

469
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:07,400
Find it in your heart to forgive him?

470
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,362
Is he here?

471
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:14,365
Not now?

472
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:18,536
Sure, I'll forgive him.

473
00:42:18,775 --> 00:42:21,777
Right after I kill him.

474
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,125
We're... we're all held accountable...

475
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,547
You know, one way or another.
