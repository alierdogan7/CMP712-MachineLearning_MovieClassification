they took my wife.

in their... eyes.

Those men are the worst of their kind.

356
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:51,017
Why does it strike me
that the last time I saw you...

357
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:54,220
after some of the things you did
for General Sherman,

358
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,275
the men...

359
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,006
they called you Diablo?

360
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:02,939
I asked the men what it meant.

361
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:07,742
And when they told me...
I learned something about you.

362
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:12,321
No. No, I was just following orders.

363
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:16,610
I'm a married man
intent on landing my family.

364
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,980
You were eventually...
Sherman's best killer,

365
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,762
and as I recall, you came
to enjoy life on his trail.

00:53:28,987 --> 00:53:32,141

00:53:36,662 --> 00:53:38,398
Yes.

Why did you come here?

372
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:47,190
I came to ask for your help.

373
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:51,930
After all these years,
you're still torturing yourself over...

374

375
00:53:56,849 --> 00:53:59,201
Go home, son.

376
00:53:59,585 --> 00:54:01,837
