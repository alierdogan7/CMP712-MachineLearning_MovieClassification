and all for nothing
but a kiss...

187
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:29,431
And a promise.

188
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,556
Stop that.

189
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,692
I'm married!

190
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:44,512
I just came to thank you
for what you did.

191
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,731
[Train whistle]

[Sniffs]

194
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,545
Whoa.

195
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:05,533
Another wretched soul for you
to commend to heaven, Reverend.

196
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,385
Ahh.

197
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:14,309
I don't remember seeing you
at the pulpit of late.

198
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,478
Come to think of it, I...

199
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,647
Can't recall you
preaching at all

200
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,984
since we arrived
here at our new home.

201
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:25,386
Yeah, well, I have
nothing to say.

202
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,689
No one wants to hear.

203
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,192
You know, they've
taken away my church.

204
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,061
A den of thieves.

205
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,414
They've also taken my caboose.

206
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,666
You know, my very own
daughter took it from me.

207
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,368
And I believe she's--

208
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,705
She's trying to corrupt my son.

209
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,624
Shame.

210
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:54,516
Our lord rode into Jerusalem
on the back of an ass.

211
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,752
And one of the first thing
he done when got there

212
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:02,273
was cleanse the temple.

213
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:06,694
Herd the money lenders out
on their avaricious rumps.

214
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:10,532
It's time we overturn
the tables, Reverend.

215
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,119
We must cast them out.

216
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,619
Durant: If we can
cross this,

217
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,557
we have a clear path to
the Colorado territory.

218
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,842
If we fail,

219
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,978
or if we're delayed,

220
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:43,097
I lose my race
with the central pacific

221
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:46,868
and this railroad is a failure.

222
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,653
Men don't want me here.

223
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,072
They won't work hard.

224
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:53,641
Then make them!
It ain't that easy.

225
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:58,312
I bought your life back.

226
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,781
And you made a bad purchase.

227
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,983
That's my business.

228
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,286
Yours is to get me
to the rockies.

229
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,038
Sooner you do that,

230
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,207
sooner you'll be free.

231
00:15:19,436 --> 00:15:21,053
We are not here to cast stones

232
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:24,589
or talk about the circumstances
of Mr. Schmidt's death.

233
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:28,760
The time for judgment
is not now.

234
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:30,762
This is a time to reflect.

235
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,532
Look around.

236
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:38,287
This is the world
that Mr. schmidt built.

237
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,439
You.

238
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,575
These friendships.

239
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:45,610
Just as all of you
have joined him

240
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:49,048
in the building
of this railroad.

241
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,467
After all...

242
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,552
Was Jesus not a carpenter?

243
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,971
A builder?

244
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,475
For this, we are all blessed.

245
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,060

Fornicator!

Reverend, please.

248
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,401
Now this is not a time

249
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,903
to cast judgment or speak
about the sins of the dead--

250
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,771
I'm not speaking
about the dead.

251
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,323
I'm speaking about you.

252
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:18,277
She has lain with a man
from the camp,

253
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:21,330
and the blood of her sin

254
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,499
has stained our altar!

255
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,783
How dare you come in here!

256
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,586
You won't take my church.
Your church?!

257
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,838
You gave this church up
for a bottle of whisky.

is not your enemy.

We have all lost a brother.

Poor Mr. schmidt.

00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:56,615
You tr-- you traveled
from Germany together.

268
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,951
Eh? Is it not true?

269
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,036
Jah.

270
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,622
How did your friend
brave those seas

271
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,542
to be gutted and displayed
in the street,

272
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,962
like a pig
in your butcher shop?

273
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,030
He was a good man.

274
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:13,665
Yeah, he was.

And he was murdered
by whoremongers.

at Reverend Cole.

Oh, no, no, no.

280
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,481
It is at a world

281
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,067
where your friend is dead
and, uh, Irish brothers

282
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,686

are allowed to walk free

on that gorge, Ms. Bell?

296
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,238
She thinks we should avoid it.

Thomas, please.

298
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,578
I believe it to be
too dangerous.

299

We've never built a bridge of
that size and scope before.

300

And the sioux will harass
us every step of the way.

00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:43,288
And that's where I come
in, I suppose, huh?

into the slaughterhouse.

dumbass. Get in there.

368
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,367
[Indistinct muttering]

369
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,893
I told your black friend.

370
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,745
I will tell you.

371
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,481
Either you kill these men
or I will.

372
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,682
You hear that, Irish?!

373
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,734
Either way,
you're going to die.

374
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,437
All right, the whole
damn town heard you.

375
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,741
You proved you're a man.

376
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,944
Get your ass on out of here
before I show them otherwise.

377
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,743
[Train whistle]

378
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,993
Why the long face?

379
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,362
Your father's right.

380
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,164
We are fornicators.

381
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:47,666
Please, Joseph!

382
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:51,837
We preach against sin, but in
God's eyes, we are sinners.

383
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:53,756
This injun bothering you, miss?

384
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,875
No. Thank you.

385
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:57,909
Ruth!

386
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:00,712
Ruth, I love you.

387
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,584
I want to marry you.

388
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,260
Joseph, think about
what you're saying.

389
00:24:15,311 --> 00:24:17,312
We will never be accepted
as man and wife.

390
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:20,432
Then let's leave this place.

391
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:22,434
Our church is here, Joseph.

392
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:25,937
If I leave it with
father, it will die.

393
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:36,248
You've got to get us
out of here.

394
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,884
Sean.

395
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:46,892
I'll write ma a proper
letter about your hanging.

396
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,927
I won't mention the whores.

397
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:50,896
My hanging?

398
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:52,815
Wake up, brother,
they're hanging you, too.

399
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:55,800
I never laid a hand on him!
Neither did I.

400
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:58,821
Then why did you go around
blabbing to everyone that you had?

401
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:01,073
I-- I was with my girl!

402
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,308
Your girl.
You mean the whore.

403
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,444
Watch your mouth.

404
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,613
She's a whore, Mickey.

405
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:11,166
By definition,
she screws men for money.

406
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,418
And you want to impress her.

407
00:25:13,486 --> 00:25:15,671
Ginny believed it, and then
the other girls did, too,

408
00:25:15,755 --> 00:25:18,957
and-- I liked 'em
believing it.

409
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:22,628
And you let me believe
it, too, wouldn't you?

410
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,680
I wanted you to think
that I could do something

411
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:28,016
on me own for once.

412
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:35,724
Well, surely
Mr. Bohannon

413
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:38,694
wouldn't let us hang.

414
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:43,866
Will he?

415
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:49,821
Even if, somehow,

416
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:52,791
we slipped the noose,

417
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:57,296
that Kraut bastard
will butcher us soon enough.

418
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,798
Right?

419
00:26:04,304 --> 00:26:08,873
You and me both know Mickey
McgGinnes didn't de-bowel schmidt.

420
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:11,059
He was just flapping his gums
to impress some girls.

421
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:12,811
Well, he confessed.

422
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:14,980
That's good enough for me.

423
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:16,732
What about his brother?

424
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:18,984
Well, they're obviously
in it together.

425
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:22,187
So hang 'em both, huh?

426
00:26:22,238 --> 00:26:24,907
[Sighs] Well...

427
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:27,442
Sean, uh,

428
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:29,077
works for me.
He can be valuable.

429
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:31,413
Perhaps we should spare him.

430
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:33,064
[Exhales]

431
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:35,400
But we cannot
be seen to be weak

432
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,920
on the killing of a foreman.

433
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,588
All right, then.

434
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:41,506
Sunrise, we string 'em up.

435
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:43,241
Perhaps we should
investigate further.

436
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:46,428
What's to investigate?
He's a confessed killer,

437
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:48,079
end of story.
He might be innocent.

438
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:49,765
You know...

439
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:54,937
I'm going to leave
you two to debate that.

440
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,939
[Woman laughs]

441
00:26:57,023 --> 00:26:59,191
[Indistinct chatter]

442
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:03,278
We have to stop
Mr. Bohannon

443
00:27:03,363 --> 00:27:05,197
from hanging Mickey McGinnes.

444
00:27:05,264 --> 00:27:08,450
We ain't got
to do nothin' about it.

445
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:13,121
The man is innocent.

446
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:15,273
So what?

447
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:17,492
They hang, we scot free.

448
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:21,463
I'm going to tell Mr
. durant what we've done.

449
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:23,048
Hold on now.

450
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,550
You confess, you'll be
watching me hang instead of him.

451
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:29,454
[Sighs] But you were
operating under my orders.

452
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:32,891
Don't matter. Durant sure as hell
ain't going to noose your neck.

453
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:37,145
[Sighs]

454
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,564
I'll keep your name out of it.

455
00:27:39,632 --> 00:27:42,351
I know you will.

456
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,614
Welcome, brother.
Thank you for joining us.

457
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:57,666
Our God's love for us

458
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,919
is the reason
he gave us his laws.

459
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:03,154
[Spits]

460
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,759
And our love of our God

461
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:10,512
is the reason we obey his laws.

462
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:12,681
What's the law about an injun

463
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:15,267
fornicating with a white woman?

464
00:28:15,334 --> 00:28:17,019
This is a house of God!

465
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:18,720
[Laughs]

466
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:24,192
You done made it
your own personal cathouse.

467
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:29,781
[All grunting]

468
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:45,380
Ahhh!

469
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:48,467
[All grunting]

470
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,721
Let the high praise
of God be in their mouth

471
00:28:52,805 --> 00:28:55,891
and a two inches sword
in their hand.

472
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:58,560
[Groaning and gasping]

473
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:05,901
You ok, son?

474
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:13,575
[Spits]

475
00:29:21,664 --> 00:29:24,383
Thank you.

476
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,684
Miss Ruth.

477
00:29:25,768 --> 00:29:28,103
It's only some
fried pork and beans.

478
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,056
Well, at this moment,
it's a feast fit for a king.

479
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,810
Mick.

480
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:36,862
Food.

481
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,702
Have you made peace
with your maker, Sean?

482
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:46,705
Need a priest for that, Ruth.

483
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:49,875
To hear our sins.

484
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:53,912
All that really matters is that
you have peace in your heart.

485
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:56,465
Don't you think?

486
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:06,391
I don't want
to hear that right now.

487
00:30:07,894 --> 00:30:10,846
All right.

488
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:12,681
I'll go.

489
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:14,566
No.

490
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:18,737
Stay with me.

491
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:24,225
Your face.

492
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:26,912
Your voice.

493
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:31,500
They bring me peace.

494
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:41,126
[Insects buzzing]

495
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:05,283
It was me.

496
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:07,569
I killed the foreman.

497
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,105
Yes, of course you did.

498
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:12,457
With your bare hands, hmm.

499
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:17,629
I paid a man $20 to kill him.

500
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:30,759
You're serious.

501
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,262
I didn't know
he was your foreman.

502
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:37,966
But I wouldn't have acted
differently had I known.

503
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:40,318
Thomas, he was a murderer.

504
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:44,156
Under whose authority
did you take this action,

505
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,074
Mrs. Bell?

506
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:48,810
It was justice.

507
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:52,581
So... You became

508
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:56,317
judge, jury and executioner.

509
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:58,620
As you are doing
with Mr. McGinnes.

510
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:02,323
After all I've done for you.

511
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,260
[Chuckles] You...

512
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:07,846
Usurped my authority,

513
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,681
put my railroad at risk,

514
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:12,851
killed one of my most
valuable employees,

515
00:32:12,935 --> 00:32:16,337
and you dare to claim
that it was justice!

516
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:19,524
It was justice!
An innocent man is going to hang!

517
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,360
Someone has to hang!

518
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,396
Perhaps you would like
to take their place

519
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,033
in the interests of justice.

520
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,549
You lookin' for this?

521
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:49,704
She's an old piece.

522
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:53,091
But she still shoots true, huh?

523
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,712
Very flattering.

524
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:01,066
It was you
agitating the Germans

525
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,734
to hang the McGinnes boys.

526
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:05,720
Payback for the tar
and feathers, I guess?

527
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:07,055
No, no, not true.

528
00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:10,058
Any dispute between the celts

529
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,993
and my nordic brethren,

530
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:14,863
I must side with my brethren.

531
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,065
And like them, I--

532
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:20,452
I despise the Irish.

533
00:33:21,737 --> 00:33:25,240
See...

534
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,710
I got this idea.

535
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:32,764
You hate pretty much everybody.

536
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,517
Especially yourself.

537
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:40,805
Yes, that is where we are
similar, Mr. Bohannon.

538
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:45,393
But I hate you

539
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:48,864
more than you hate yourself.

540
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:54,986
You keep agitating trouble
on this railroad...

541
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:59,207
You're going to a deep sleep
at the bottom of your muck pile.

542
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:02,794
There won't be nobody
to mourn or miss you, either.

543
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:06,715
You will miss me,
Mr. Bohannon.

544
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:10,552
Yeah.

545
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,723
Will you so kind
as to replace my weapon?

546
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,925
Oh.

547
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:19,010
Yeah.

548
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,231
Fa!

549
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:36,659
You should leave this place.

550
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:38,778
Return to your people.

551
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,996
I don't have
any people anymore.

552
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,665
Thanks to you.

553
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:47,420
I know.

554
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,922
I know it's--
It's all my fault.

555
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,125
But that's why
you can't stay here.

556
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,930
You can't tell me what
I can and can't do anymore.

557
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,581
I believed in you.

558
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:02,218
And everything
you told me was a lie.

559
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,104
Jesus can't bring peace
to these people!

560
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,523
And all they want
to do is kill.

561
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,259
Kill my people,
kill each other,

562
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,194
ah, kill everything!

563
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:15,698
But that's-- that's why
you can't stay here.

564
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,733
I love your daughter.

565
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,985
I'm not going to abandon her.

566
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,655
I'm not like you.

567
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:30,129
[Train whistle]

568
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,621
[Sighs]

569
00:35:40,841 --> 00:35:43,458
[Train whistle]

570
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:47,629
[Glass breaks]

571
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,232
[Indistinct chatter]

572
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,485
[Pig squealing in distance]

573
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:55,437
[Rooster crowing]

574
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,023
[Indistinct chatter]

575
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:07,249
[Sighs]

576
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:09,084
Go ahead.

577
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:13,005
[Indistinct chatter
and yelling]

578
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:14,924
Mr. Bohannon.

579
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:18,177
Mr. durant just decided
to let the brothers go.

580
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,296
All by his self
he decided that?

581
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,847
Yes.

582
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,966
Why did he send you
to tell me, then?

583
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:26,185
He didn't.
I volunteered.

584
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,188
Really? What's
your stake in this?

585
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,023
I think they're innocent.

586
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,609
Think they're innocent?

587
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:36,695
[Train whistle]

588
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,232
Mr. Bohannon, go
and set them free.

589
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:48,374
All right, then.

590
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,492
But hanging might have
been merciful

591
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:52,494
compared to what that Kraut
butcher is going to do to them.

592
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:55,631
And you'll protect
them, won't you?

593
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,919
It ain't my job to protect 'em.

594
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:12,097
I know what you did.

595
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:14,767
What's that?

596
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:21,556
[Sighs]

597
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,748
What was you and Mrs.
Bell talking about

598
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,402
in the saloon the other night?

599
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,088
What we did together.

600
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,425
Yeah?

601
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,777
Mm-hmm.

602
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,719
Keep a keen edge
on that thing, huh?

603
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,939
Got to.

604
00:37:57,644 --> 00:38:00,729
Yeah.

605
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,534
You come a long way since you
used it on Johnson, didn't you?

606
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:08,537
Mm-hmm.

607
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,124
Just be careful.

608
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:15,210
Next time a noose
goes around your neck,

609
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:19,114
it might not slip off so easy.

610
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:21,967
Thanks for the warning.

611
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:30,676
Guten tag, herr Bohannon.

612
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,178
I'm turning
the McGinnes brothers loose.

613
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:35,397
Mr. Durant's order.

614
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:39,018
That is unfortunate.

615
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,907
But soon justice does have
a knack of finding a way.

616
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:49,862
Like a pig to the trough, no?

617
00:38:56,836 --> 00:39:00,155
You need to leave town.

618
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:02,958
What was that?

619
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:06,595
There's a train leaving in about an hour.
You need to be on it.

620

[Chopping]

621
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:15,938
Or what?

[Grunts]

623
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,624
This is a free country, by God!

624
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,826
[Chuckles] Yeah.

625
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:40,212
That was about the funniest
damn thing I ever heard.

626

[Train whistle

627
