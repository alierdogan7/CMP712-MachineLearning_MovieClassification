[Walt] I'm looking where the shirts are.

looking where all the shirts are.

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,565

12:22 when their car got run off the road.

Two guys got out of the

Uh, Jerry says that, um...
that they were just after money

58
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:30,678
and that, uh, Peter started
acting like he was tough and...

59
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:34,306
they shot him.

60
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,184
And this is Peter Hoyt?

61
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,043
I think so. I-I mean, it must be.

62
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:43,297
I-I didn't check for I.D. or anything.
I didn't want to mess up the crime scene.

Yeah.

He's, uh... He's still pretty freaked out.

66
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:52,199
Uh, he says that they
threatened to shoot him, too,

67
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:54,308
but he wound up just giving
them all of his money,

68
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:57,371
and they took his crutches
and just left him here.

69
00:05:57,438 --> 00:05:58,396
His crutches?

70
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:01,249
Yeah. He's a cripple.

- Yep.
- Sorry.

Um, here, you can keep these.

00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:16,372
Shit. Yeah. Forgot about that.

stuff, it might come in handy.

the window with a gun,

82
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:42,374
and, uh, they yelled at Peter
to give them all his money.

83
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:46,795
But he just won pretty big at the casino,
and so he didn't want to give it up.

84
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:49,130
And then they pulled him out of the car.

00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:56,805
- [sobs]
- It's all right, Mr. Napek.

and some water if you're hungry.

88
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:10,903
You think you could, uh,
describe the men who did this?

00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,781
I-I was just so scared.

90
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:17,075
I was just trying to keep my head down.

91
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:19,602
I thought they were gonna kill me, too.

92
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:21,329
Why do you think they didn't?

93
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:24,398
I think when they saw my condition,

94
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,627
they didn't think of
me as much of a threat.

95
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:29,922
They just took my crutches and
my phone and they left me here.

96
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:33,258
I had to crawl for help.

97
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,661
I didn't... I didn't know where I was

98
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:40,140
or if I was even going
in the right direction.

99
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,270
I tried to save Peter.

100
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:47,982
I tried.

101
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,318
But I couldn't save him.

102
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:18,303
[Mathias] Well, well, well.

103
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:21,556
What brings you to Hector's wall?

104
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:22,998
Hello, Mathias.

105
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:25,979
[Mathias] I've been wondering who's
been resurrecting the myth of Hector,

106
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:28,671
and I suppose it makes
sense it would be the guy

107
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:31,483
who was basically
responsible for his death.

108
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,551
I do not know what you are talking about.

109
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:34,862
[Mathias] Bullshit.

110
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,489
I know someone's been
picking up Hector's notes.

111
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,534
It looks like you are.

112
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,103
[Mathias] It's been about the only way

113
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:46,999
for me to find out what's
happening on the Res anymore.

114
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:54,381
So, is filling Hector's shoes
your way of atoning for your sins?

115
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:57,491
I am not here to pick up Hector's notes.

116
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:59,344
I am here to leave one for him.

117
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,682
This is private.

118
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:06,852
Between you and a ghost? Unh-unh.

119
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,439
As soon as someone started answering
these and breaking the law to do it,

120
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:12,983
this became my business.

121
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,175
You are assuming I am asking
Hector to break the law.

122
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:18,906
No, I'm assuming you're bullshitting me
and that really isn't a letter to Hector.

123
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:22,600
You don't strike me as one
of those superstitious Indians

124
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,078
who believes in spirits.

125
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:29,374
But you do seem self-righteous enough to
think that you could take Hector's place.

126
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:32,252
You do not honestly believe I
am trying to be the new Hector.

127
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:36,256
The longer you refuse to show
me that letter, the more I do.

128
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:59,113
This new Hector copycat is
making my job even more difficult.

129
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:04,118
It's been hard enough to rebuild trust
after the way Malachi ran this department.

130
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:07,162
Now the people trust this
vigilante more than me.

131
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,123
I'm gonna shut him down.

132
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:13,567
But if he can take care of this first?

133
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:15,253
More power to him.

134
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,833
Whoa.

135
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,518

137
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:33,981

138
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,858
Uh, training seminar?

139

Vic.

140
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,695
Yeah?

141
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:43,323
- I need you to take a statement.
- Okay. Whose?

142
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:45,408
Mine.

143
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,495
What'd he do this time?

144
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,563
Saved a man's life.

145
00:10:50,564 --> 00:10:53,541
Travis was the first witness
at the scene of a robbery.

146
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:57,152
One man's dead, and his friend's
at the hospital being checked out.

147
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:00,948
Ferg, victim's name was Peter Hoyt.

148
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:02,324
Here's his license plate number.

149
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:05,078
Find out what you can...
address, employer, next of kin.

150
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,245
I'd do it myself,

151
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:09,516
but I told the survivor I'd give him
a ride home after he's done at the E.R.

152
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,518
Got it.

153
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:17,816
So, uh, do you need me
to swear in or anything?

154
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,596
He all right?

155
00:11:23,597 --> 00:11:27,117
[Walt] He's got a few scrapes,
maybe a little dehydrated.

156
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:29,184
Doctors got some fluids in him.

157
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:31,121
This guy's been through
a lot worse than that.

158
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,981
Yeah. Even so, he was pretty shaken up.

159
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:35,458
They, uh, gave him some sedatives.

160
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,276
[Jerry] Ah!

161
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:38,753
[groaning]

162
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:08,933
[Henry] I feel like I have lost a step.

163
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:11,393
I read that boxing is an
all-around great workout,

164
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,354
but I lack the discipline
to train on my own.

165
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:18,192
[Jack] You're in luck. I'm
running a midlife-crisis special.

166
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:23,215
For 100 bucks a month, I'll turn you
into the best over-40 boxer on the Res,

167
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,341
present company excepted.

168
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:27,994
I'll find you some gloves.

169
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:29,512
Here. Tape up.

170
00:12:32,624 --> 00:12:37,145
So, Jack, maybe you can
help me settle a bet.

171
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,940
My friend and I were watching
a Burt Reynolds movie.

172
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:44,844
Burt popped a guy in the
mouth and knocked out a tooth.

173
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:48,406
My friend said that could not
happen. I disagreed. Who is right?

174
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:51,868
Depends on how bad the teeth
are and how good the punch.

175
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:55,104
Is there any particular technique,

176
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,582
any part of the mouth that
is especially vulnerable?

177
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:00,294
After you warm up, I'll show you.

178
00:13:01,153 --> 00:13:02,087
[Walt] Henry.

179
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,381
What are you doing here?

180
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:06,699
Looking for you.

181
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,994
Hey, Sheriff, do me a favor. Warm him up.

182
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:12,347
I've got some things to
take care of in my office.

183
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,016
[chuckles]

184
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,627
Yeah. That sounds like the
Peter Hoyt I'm talking about.

185
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:20,796
Sure. I'll hold.

186
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:21,922
I still can't get over it.

187
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,924
You know, the guy, he can't walk,

188
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:26,361
and he dragged himself almost
three miles just to get help.

189
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:29,114
- I mean, most people would have quit.
- Okay, focus, Travis.

190
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:31,932
Right. Uh, sorry.

191
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,202
Is that Peter Hoyt's blood on you?

192
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,705
Wow. Um...

193
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,108
Yeah, I-I guess, uh...

194
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:45,630
I guess that's from when the sheriff and
I were moving his body over to the Bronco.

195
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,658
It could also be Jerry's because
I-I carried him over to my car.

196
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:52,679
He was pretty bloody, too.

197
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,350
You ever get used to it?

198
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:59,811
Dead bodies and all that?

199
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:04,816
After a few years, sure.

200
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,234
Don't listen to him, Travis.

201
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:12,157
If death stops getting
to you, you should quit.

202
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:17,078
[sighs]

203
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:24,294
So, what is the latest with the
case against those men who raped Gab?

204
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,903
There is no case.

205
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:29,424
Victim won't file charges
or talk, so nothing I can do.

206
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,994
Not to mention, I got a
mugging and a murder last night,

207
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,471
someone leaving that casino, so...

208
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:36,806
Is that why you are here?

209
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,334
No.

210
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:43,296
Actually, I had a very
strange dream last night.

211
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:44,731
Felt like it meant something.

212
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:48,026
[grunts] I am not much of a Freudian.

213
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:53,990
Well, I was looking for a more
traditional interpretation.

214
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:56,368
Didn't your grandmother
do a lot of that stuff?

215
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,703
What kind of dream was it?

216
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:02,832
I was looking for a shirt.

217
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:07,903
Were there any spirit
animals in your dream?

218
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:09,256
An owl? A wolf?

219
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,343
- Nope.
- One of your ancestors?

220
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:16,596
Nope.

221
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:19,724
Well, then I cannot help you.
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

222
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:24,979
What happened to your nose?

223
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:28,132
Started bleeding.

224
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:31,468
So, what'd we find out
about our shooting victim?

225
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,804
Well, turns out the deceased, Peter Hoyt,

226
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:36,366
was just released from
prison a couple weeks ago.

227
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,392
Right.

228
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,644
So, what was he in for?

229
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:43,831
[Ferg] Assault in Sheridan eight years ago.

230
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,917
Served eight years?

231
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,279
That's just two years shy of
the max. Must have been serious.

232
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,215
Find any next of kin?

233
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:55,284
His parents live in Ranchwood.

234
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,804
The car's actually registered to them.

235
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,767
Well, someone needs to notify them.

236
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:05,836
I should probably head to Sheridan,

237
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:09,732
see if I can find any details about that
assault, might shine a light on this.

238
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:13,736
Um, I could go and see his parents.

239
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:22,203
Why don't you take the Charger?

240
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,374
It's no good doing a
notification in a Trans Am.

241
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:33,840
[door closes]

242
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:36,634
- [indistinct conversations]
- [telephone ringing]

243
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,351
Excuse me.

244
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,020
- Is Dr. Monaghan available?
- Do you have an appointment?

245
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,688
- No.
- Then no.

246
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:52,317
You need to call and make an
appointment. Unless it's an emergency.

247
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:55,111
Is it an emergency?

248
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:06,873
[Walt] Don't worry. It's not bad. Um...

249
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:13,963
I was in Sheridan on business, and,
um, I just dropped by to apologize.

250
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:15,756
Oh.

251
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:17,758
For what?

252
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:20,178
Accusing me of drug trafficking?

253
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,515
I guess that about sums it up, yeah.

254
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:25,641
Okay, well, let's hear it, then.

255
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:28,603
What?

256
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,690
Your apology for accusing
me of drug trafficking.

257
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,569
Didn't I just do that?

258
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,655
Is it hard for you to admit you're wrong?

259
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,618
Isn't it hard for everybody?

260
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,877
So [clears throat] I'm sorry that
I accused you of drug trafficking.

261
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:56,780
It's just, you know, there were
stolen drugs at your church meeting,

262
00:17:56,781 --> 00:18:02,720
same drugs that I saw here, and, uh,
well, you can see how that looked.

263
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:07,475
So, you're sorry but not really.

264
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,709
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,937
Completely.

266
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:15,816
You didn't deserve that, especially
given all the good you do.

267
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:21,030
Okay. Thank you, Sheriff.

268
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,912
[sighs]

269
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:35,378
Do you want an apology
receipt or something?

270
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,402
[alarm chirps]

271
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:04,031
[knock on door]

272
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:07,118
Mr. Hoyt?

273
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,453
Yeah? What do you want?

274
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,455
I need to talk to you
about your son, Peter.

275
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:12,398
Can you guys just leave
him alone, all right?

276
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:13,500
He's done his time.

277
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,168
It's... It's not it, sir.

278
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,528
He's not here. He went to visit his friend.

279
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,255
I don't know when he'll be back.

280
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:20,298
Sir.

281
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:24,093
Peter's not coming back.

282
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,099
Your son and his friend
were robbed last night,

283
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:35,962
and during the course of the
robbery, your son, Peter, he was shot.

284
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:37,482
[Thomas] Oh, God.

285
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:41,819
What about Jerry? Is Jerry okay?

286
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:45,722
Uh, Jerry's alive.

287
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:48,225
[sighs] Thank God.

288
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,328
Thank God.

289
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:55,982
So, I-I guess... I guess you know Jerry?

290
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:56,959
[Thomas] Oh, I do.

291
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,672
Jerry was our family's friend.

292
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:03,633
Maybe the best we've ever
had. You're sure he's okay?

293
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:07,803
I-I gather that he's a little shaken up.

294
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,931
But, yeah, he's... He's okay.

295
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:18,838
Uh, sir, I, uh... I know
that this is a shock.

296
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,652
Um, but I need you to understand.

297
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:26,989
Your son, Peter, he's dead.

298
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,308
[Thomas] Yeah, I know.

299
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,767
[liquid pouring]

300
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:35,623
Oh, it's just... You sound
more concerned about his friend.

301
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:41,045
It's terrible to say, but, um...

302
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:43,881
I think you're right.

303
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:47,260
Pete was in prison. He became a stranger.

304
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:50,954
Jerry was here... with us.

305
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:52,581
He lifted up our spirits.

306
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:56,770
He moved heaven and earth
to get Pete out of prison.

307
00:20:56,836 --> 00:21:00,022
That was just a couple weeks ago?

308
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:02,108
His fourth parole hearing.

309
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:07,346
And, uh, I-I don't think
Pete would have survived

310
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:09,348
if they'd made him serve his full sentence,

311
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:13,059
so thanks to Jerry...

312
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,564
he got to enjoy a little
bit of freedom before...

313
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:19,459
before he died.

314
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:31,328
[Schones] Peter Hoyt,
aggravated assault, 2007.

315
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,872
He entered a sporting
goods store with a .45

316
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:36,142
and told the manager to
hand over all the cash.

317
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:40,271
Got about 750 bucks, then he
shot the manager in the gut.

318
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:44,049
Then Hoyt shot him again... in the back.

319
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,385
- So a thief and a coward.
- Yep.

320
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:49,722
And the only thing that kept him
from being a cold-blooded murderer

321
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:51,741
is that the clerk somehow survived.

322
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,828
- Accomplices?
- Uh...

323
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:56,102
Nope.

324
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:59,332
He was just one of those guys who gets
a gun and feels like he ought to use it.

325
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,584
Anything unusual about the victim?

326
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:04,903
Besides the fact that
he survived two bullets?

327
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,088
No.

328
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:10,217
Working stiff, married, no kids.

329
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,638
What's his name?

330
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:16,516
Um... Jerry Napek.

331
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,576
[knock on door]

332
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:38,371
Hey. Can I come in?

333
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:40,874
I was just about to leave.

334
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,917
I can't keep doing this.

335
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,002
Doing what?

336
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,779
Waiting tables.

337
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,740
Waiting for the next
six-figure job to just show up,

338
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:52,909
Waiting for my life to
suddenly kick into gear.

339
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:56,222
I need to do something with my life.

340
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:58,432
How can I help?

341
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:01,668
Okay.

342
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:05,213
There's basically two
legal practices in Durant.

343
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:07,507
One of them doesn't need me,
and the other one hates me,

344
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:09,569
so I was thinking about the Res.

345
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,070
What about the Res?

346
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,888
I-I think I could do
really good work there.

347
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:16,325
I mean, I could help people like Gab.

348
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:18,226
And I was hoping that
you would introduce me

349
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:20,496
to whoever provides
legal services to the Res.

350
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,356
Henry, I don't care about the money.

351
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:25,084
I'll volunteer my time.

352
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:30,924
But at least then I'd be
doing something... important.

353
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,888
Do not waste your time.

354
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:39,790
The people do not trust
lawyers from the outside.

355
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,476
And anytime a well-intentioned
activist shows up,

356
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:44,127
it usually takes less than six months

357
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,105
for them to learn there
is nothing they can do.

358
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:51,110
- Henry, I'm willing to try.
- That is your choice.

359
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:55,848
But you and I have both seen how
the legal system serves the Res.

360
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:57,599
And I cannot in good conscience

361
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,370
encourage you to throw your life away
tilting at that particular windmill.

362
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,039
[scoffs]

363
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:17,887
[indistinct conversations]

364
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,267
[Jerry] Oh, hey, Sheriff.

365
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,436
Welcome to the Taj Mahal.

366
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:27,271
How are you, Jerry?

367
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:29,607
Well, I can't feel my legs.

368
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,693
Come on back.

369
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:41,393
So, I understand your friendship with
Peter Hoyt was a little complicated.

370
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,537
Oh. That.

371
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:45,980
Yeah. That.

372
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:51,570
So, you want to know how I could be
friends with a man who shot me twice,

373
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:56,216
permanently destroyed my digestive
system, and took away the use of my legs.

374
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:57,826
I do.

375
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:59,595
I had no choice.

376
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:01,663
I know that sounds crazy,

377
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:07,961
but you got to understand... I know
what it's like to live the other way.

378
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:12,340
During Pete's trial and
about three years after that,

379
00:25:12,341 --> 00:25:16,970
I was so consumed with hate for him,

380
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:19,740
I didn't have room for
anything else in my life.

381
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:23,285
I lost my wife. I lost my job.

382
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:27,564
You know what it's like when
the only thing you can think of

383
00:25:27,565 --> 00:25:30,442
from the second you wake up in the morning

384
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:35,381
until you medicate yourself
to sleep at night is hate?

385
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:38,342
I can imagine.

386
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:39,719
I don't think you can.

387
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:41,804
It's hell.

388
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:46,249
I would have killed myself if
I hadn't met Father Donahue.

389
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,977
He taught me about forgiveness.

390
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:52,839
He just made me understand that
as long as I hated Pete Hoyt,

391
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,317
he had control of my life

392
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:58,696
and that forgiving him wasn't weakness.

393
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:02,742
It was a gift I was giving to myself.

394
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:05,978
And when I stopped spending
all my time hating him,

395
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,748
I had time to focus on some other things,

396
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:13,669
like getting out of
this chair, like living.

397
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:21,534
So you advocated for his
release at his parole hearing?

398
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:22,762
I did.

399
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:26,933
He made a mistake, and he paid for it.

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,978
Keeping him in prison wasn't doing
anything but keeping me from moving on.

401
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:35,691
Forgiveness can set
everybody free, Sheriff.

402
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:39,862
Well, it takes a big man to think that way.

403
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:42,973
Well, it doesn't happen overnight.

404
00:26:42,974 --> 00:26:47,912
But when it does, it opens up
a whole world of possibilities.

405
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:54,919
I just wish that Pete had, um...
had more time to experience that.

406
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,048
Well, I'm sure he was grateful
for the time you got him.

407
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:03,260
You think?

408
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:04,804
I do.

409
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:11,268
Sheriff, can I ask you a
favor? And you can say no.

410
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:12,895
Go ahead.

411
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:17,298
I see people put these memorials
out by the side of the road,

412
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:21,302
and, uh, I made this for Pete.

413
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:24,389
And I was wondering if maybe
you had some time this week

414
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,310
that maybe you could drive
me out to where it happened

415
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:33,082
and I could, uh... I
could put this up for him.

416
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:36,710
I can do that.

417
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,091
You call Ruby at the
station. We'll set it up.

418
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:47,746
What the hell do you want?

419
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:51,041
Well, I was gonna offer my help,
but not if you're gonna yell at me.

420
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:51,976
Wait.

421
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:55,461
Sorry.

422
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:56,396
What?

423
00:27:56,463 --> 00:27:58,774
The boss in?

424
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,653
This is not an isolated incident.

425
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,738
I've had three in the last two weeks.

426
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:06,723
How do you know they're related?

427
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:09,827
I don't, but it seems like
it's worth checking out.

428
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,270
Three people win big at the casino,

429
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:15,374
then as they're driving off,
they get pulled over and robbed.

430
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,984
- Anybody die?
- [Mathias] No.

431
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:20,796
All the victims describe
the attacks the same way?

432
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:23,115
Only one victim has come forward.

433
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:25,408
So, how do you know that
there are three crimes?

434
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:26,927
Well, that's a long story.

435
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:28,345
It's also not an answer.

436
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:30,139
Afraid it'll have to be.

437
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:34,751
Look, I'm trying to help you guys out.

438
00:28:34,752 --> 00:28:38,856
We close your case, I close three of mine.

439
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:40,566
Except you only have one.

440
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:47,406
Sue Smart, last Thursday night.

441
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:51,952
Terry Thurlow, the Saturday
before that at 2:00 a.m.

442
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:55,915
And Joe Lone Elk, not sure
what day, but before dawn.

443
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:04,339
So, why do you need my help?

444
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,701
Because I'm having a harder and harder time

445
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:11,430
getting people to take
me seriously on the Res.

446
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:15,517
And you have a murder. People
pay attention to a murder.

447
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:22,566
Our surviving victim
was pretty traumatized.

448
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:25,152
Maybe these folks
remember some more details.

449
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,999
Maybe you and I ought to do this together.

450
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,512
Lone Elk.

451
00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:57,017
I want to talk to you about what happened

452
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,603
when you were leaving
the casino a while back.

453
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,171
Yeah? What happened?

454
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:05,776
You went to the casino, and you won a
few hundred bucks, and you got mugged.

455
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,029
Well, the Lord giveth, Lord taketh away.

456
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:12,908
Wasn't the Lord, though, who ran you
off the road and robbed you at gunpoint.

457
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:15,935
How you know about that?

458
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,812
[Walt] Why don't you tell us what happened?

459
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,373
Why? You seem to know it all.

460
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:22,835
Not yet. How many of them were there?

461
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:26,172
Two.

462
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:28,299
- Can you describe them?
- Nope.

463
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:30,634
You didn't see them, or you
don't want to describe them?

464
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:33,220
Look, it happened. It's done.

465
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,183
Way I see it, I was being punished
for trying to take a shortcut.

466
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,667
What kind of shortcut?

467
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:41,002
Took out a loan at the casino.

468
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:43,981
Instead of working to try to
pay it back, I played craps.

469
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:46,525
What do you mean, you took
a loan out at the casino?

470
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,235
Exactly that.

471
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,363
It's easier than the
bank. There's no paperwork.

472
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:52,222
How big a loan?

473
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:53,657
$500.

474
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:56,369
Won it all back that night, too.

475
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:59,062
I should have paid off
that loan right away.

476
00:30:59,063 --> 00:31:01,374
I should have known it
was too good to be true.

477
00:31:03,025 --> 00:31:05,502
I'm not supposed to be
gambling. I'm in a program.

478
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,463
I was meant to work for that
money, which is what I'm doing now.

479
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,342
Hear you get $3 or $4
a pound for good copper.

[rock music playing]

481
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,043
Really?

482
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:23,687
That's interesting.

483
00:31:26,632 --> 00:31:28,067
Okay, I will, um...

484
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:31,653
I will ask Ms. Smart about that when
I finally get a chance to talk to her.

485
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,097
- Okay. Bye.
- Wait. Come on. Please?

486
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:35,657
Sit down.

487
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:37,451
Hey, I could use the company.

488
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:39,894
I'm still a little freaked out
about what happened earlier.

489
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,372
I've never seen a dead guy before.

490
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:44,791
Please?

491
00:31:49,738 --> 00:31:52,925
So, what's going on with my case?

492
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:55,386
I mean, have we found the
guy who killed Peter Hoyt yet?

493
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:59,348
Uh, no, we didn't catch anybody yet.

494
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:00,706
Well, what do you think, then?

495
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:02,875
I mean, do you think that
it was just a random thing,

496
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:05,878
- or did he actually know the guy?
- We don't know shit, Travis.

497
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:07,880
Only that it's probably
not an isolated incident

498
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:11,068
and that it most likely has something
to do with the casino and loan-sharking.

499
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:13,427
Wait. Loan-sharking?

500
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:15,948
You're saying there's loan
sharks here in Absaroka?

501
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:18,141
I guess. Walt just
interviewed one of the victims,

502
00:32:18,142 --> 00:32:20,077
and he said he took a
loan out at the casino.

503
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:24,939
Look, I am really tired,

504
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,669
and I have to interview a witness at
the crack of dawn, so I am gonna go home.

505
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:32,506
You know what? I should probably
go, too. I'll walk you out.

506
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:35,842
Please... don't.

507
00:32:47,171 --> 00:32:48,921

There's a lot going on.

521
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:30,171
Murder and serial muggings, so...

522
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:32,065
[Ruby] Don't lie to me, Walter.

523
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:34,026
I know you slept here last night.

524
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,344
And the night before that.

525
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,553
Well, I never said I didn't.

526
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:40,890
And I know everything that's
going on in this office.

527
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,767
I know that. [clears throat]

528
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:46,121
So, I know you were using
my computer last night.

529
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:49,124
Well, actually, it's the
department's computer.

530
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,668
And you were Googling a
Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan.

531
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:55,172
- I was just doing some follow-up...
- No, you were doing an image search.

532
00:33:56,449 --> 00:34:00,410
Walter Longmire, what do
you think Martha would say

533
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,971
if she could look down
and see you right now?

534
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:07,809
She'd say, "I'm bored."

535
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:12,171
Sleeping in a jail cell,
brooding, never cracking a smile.

536
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:16,109
- I smile.
- If you like her, ask her out.

537
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,575
I won't tell anyone.

538
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:38,549
- [door closes]
- [Travis] Good morning!

539
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:39,865
What do you want, Travis?

540
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:42,094
Uh, I need to have a little
confab with the sheriff.

541
00:34:42,161 --> 00:34:45,413
- Here I am.
- Hey, can we have a little bit of privacy?

542
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:47,540
[Walt] Nope. What is it?

543
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:52,605
Well, thought you might like to know
that you now have someone on the inside.

544
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:53,813
Inside of what?

545
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,065
The casino.

546
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:57,467
Well, I heard that you thought
that the Peter Hoyt murder

547
00:34:57,468 --> 00:34:59,385
might have something to
do with loan-sharking,

548
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:02,822
so I, uh... I went down to the
casino and I took out a loan.

549
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:08,537
Who told you that the Peter Hoyt murder
had anything to do with loan-sharking?

550
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:11,123
I don't know that that's really
all that important right now.

551
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,334
I may have, uh, inadvertently
mentioned something.

552
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,967
Okay, Serpico. Tell me about your loan.

553
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:27,830
All right, so, I let it slip at the craps
table that I could really use a loan.

554
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:29,600
Around 3:00 a.m., this dude approaches me

555
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:32,126
and tells me he can put me
in contact with somebody.

556
00:35:32,127 --> 00:35:35,564
Tells me to go to the second-floor men's
room, uh, third stall from the left,

557
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,941
and that my contact would
occupy the second stall.

558
00:35:38,008 --> 00:35:40,569
You took out a loan in the men's restroom?

559
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:45,073
Yeah. $1,200 at, uh, 20% due next week.

560
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,866
20% in a week?

561
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:49,869
I know. Can you believe that
people actually fall for that crap?

562
00:35:49,936 --> 00:35:52,289
- Well, you did.
- [Travis] No, I didn't.

563
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:53,624
I'm working as an informant.

564
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,959
Could you I.D. the man
that gave you the loan?

565
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:58,611
Well, um, see, our
transaction was stall to stall,

566
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:00,363
so I didn't see his face in the bathroom.

567
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:03,342
Did you get a name or a nickname, anything?

568
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:04,534
Not at that moment, but...

569
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:09,288
So, the information that you dug
up is that you can get a bad loan?

570
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:14,186
Look, I said I didn't see his face
in the bathroom, but I saw his boots.

571
00:36:14,253 --> 00:36:16,712
They were ostrich, blue.

572
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:18,398
I mean, they made a statement.

573
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,859
And I recognized them from
earlier at the craps table.

574
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:25,572
They belong to this big Indian dude,
guy named, uh, Darren or... or Julius.

575
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:28,283
- Was it Darius?
- Yes. Darius.

576
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,618
Scary-looking dude.

577
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:32,978
So, um, how do I go
about getting reimbursed?

578
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:35,314
Do I talk to Ruby or what?

579
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:38,293
Why don't you just return
the money that you borrowed?

580
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,298
Look, I had to sell my
cover, so I, uh... I spent it.

581
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:46,009
What the hell did you spend $1,200 on?

582
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:48,094
Craps.

583
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,484
[Cady] Hi.

584
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:04,027
My name is Cady L...

585
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:07,531
Cady. Is Mathias here?

586
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,455
Some white girl to see you.

587
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:19,400
[Mathias] Let me see if I understand.

588
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:23,630
You want to help me clear
my case backlog for free.

589
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:27,199
I want to provide legal services to
people who otherwise wouldn't get them,

590
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,886
whether they need a
prosecutor or a defender.

591
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:31,179
For free?

592
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:33,766
Well, I'm... I'm not looking to get rich.

593
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:35,934
Then you've come to the right place.

594
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,297
Look, I'm trained as a
lawyer, and I'm tending bar.

595
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:42,775
And even if I weren't,

596
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:46,027
the more I learn about most law,
the more I realize it's not for me.

597
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:50,014
But the Gabriella Langton rape showed me
a way in which I could use my education

598
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:52,033
that won't make me hate myself.

599
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,122
You Longmires are a strange lot.

600
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:01,835
These are cases we forwarded to the feds

601
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:07,716
and that they declined to pursue,
either for lack of funds...

602
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:10,009
lack of evidence...

603
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:13,764
or just plain lack of interest.

604
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,890
You can have them for an hour.

605
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:18,226
Make copies, bring them back.

606
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:23,631
Thank you.

607
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:28,153
I should take a picture right now
and write "before" underneath it.

608
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:40,314
[Walt] It was right here.

609
00:38:40,315 --> 00:38:42,751
[Jerry] Well, how can you
tell? There's no landmarks.

610
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:44,670
Sure there are.

611
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:46,987
See that bird's nest?

612
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:48,882
You want to mark the exact spot?

613
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:58,725
So, Jerry, you said you
were robbed by two men.

614
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,710
Could one of them have been Cheyenne?

615
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:02,020
[Jerry] I don't know.

616
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:03,980
Maybe.

617
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:07,425
Were they big men? Small?

618
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:09,110
Oh, big.

619
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:12,656
And one of them might have had long hair.

620
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:16,910
Did you or Peter take
out a loan at the casino?

621
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:17,976
I didn't.

622
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:20,747
What about Peter? Were you
two together the whole time?

623
00:39:20,814 --> 00:39:23,249
Yeah, except when he went to the bathroom.

624
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:29,196
There's some other folks, also got mugged.

625
00:39:29,197 --> 00:39:30,716
They gave us some details.

626
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,803
Could this man have been
one of your attackers?

627
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:39,015
Could be.

628
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:00,746
Can I help you?

629
00:40:02,063 --> 00:40:06,376
Do you have any pliers that are
a little more delicate than this?

630
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:08,152
Don't want your pliers too delicate.

631
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,154
Those there are guaranteed for 25 years.

632
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:13,258
Yes, but I need something
narrower to work in small spaces.

633
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:14,593
I may have some in the back.

634
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,429
[cell phone rings]

635
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:21,915
- Hello?
- [Ruby] Hi, Henry.

636
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,602
I'm putting Walt through.

637
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:26,044
Go ahead, Walt.

638
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:27,981
[Walt] Henry, I need to find someone.

639
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:29,983
Who?

640
00:40:30,049 --> 00:40:33,361
Darius Burns, uh, Malachi's thug.

641
00:40:33,428 --> 00:40:36,573
Remember I told you I
have this robbery homicide?

642
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,184
Well, I just found out that
Joe Lone Elk was robbed, too.

643
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:42,936
He took out a loan from the
casino before he got mugged.

644
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:44,563
Turns out he got the cash from Darius,

645
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:48,609
and now Darius has been tentatively I.D.'d
as one of the gunmen by another victim,

646
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,964
so... any idea where I might find Darius?

647
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,507
As a matter of fact, yes.
My office at the Red Pony.

648
00:40:57,076 --> 00:40:58,553
Is he there right now?

649
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,414
I cannot say for sure. The door is closed.

650
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,893
But he is usually around
at this time of day.

651
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,896
Thanks, Henry. I'll see you in a few.

652
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,442
Sir?

653
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:25,622
I think these will do.

654
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,903
[Ferg] So, you can't describe
anything about them at all?

655
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,297
No, I didn't get a look at either of them.

656
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:39,845
Look, if you hear anything
else, do not hesitate to call.

657
00:41:39,912 --> 00:41:41,220
[slots chiming]

658
00:41:52,257 --> 00:41:55,259
All righty, here we go. 3 on 13.

659
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,320
Not a problem there, boss man.

660
00:41:57,387 --> 00:41:59,638
22. Not a problem.

661
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,574
Here we go, guys. Here we go.

662
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:03,409
Red 30. Wise choice, boss.

663
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,787
All righty, no more
bets, guys. No more bets.

664
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:06,997
[Monte] Ferguson.

665
00:42:08,815 --> 00:42:10,524
Monte.

666
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:11,793
What are you doing here?

667
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,528
I was checking out the new casino.
Got a little time on my hands.

668
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:15,446
What about you?

669
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:18,574
You guys still got two deputies
patrolling the whole county?

670
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:20,743
Uh, well, three.

671
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,596
Yeah, uh, Walt ended up
hiring Zachary Heflin.

672
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:24,747
Unbelievable.

673
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:27,458
He told Zachary and me both
he wasn't hiring either of us.

674
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:32,188
Is that usually, uh... [chuckles]
a part of his M.O., lying?

675
00:42:32,255 --> 00:42:33,732
Just probably a misunderstanding.

676
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:36,568
I was there. Clear as a bell.

677
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,153
Usually play those kind of head games?

678
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,700
Look, uh, the sheriff,
he's a secretive guy.

679
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:48,395
He doesn't always tell you what
he's thinking or doing or even why.

680
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:51,666
But, uh, he's a good man.

681
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:53,710
Really?

682
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,005
- [man] Black 26!
- [crowd groans]

683
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,177
I'm gonna get out your
hair. I'm bad luck for you.

684
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:08,808
[rock music playing]

685
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:19,193
Please make it fast, Sheriff.

686
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:22,930
Where were you two nights ago?

687
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:24,473
What time?

688
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:26,159
Between midnight and 3:00 a.m.

689
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:27,660
At the casino.

690
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:29,287
You didn't leave at any point?

691
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:31,039
Nope.

692
00:43:31,982 --> 00:43:34,191
You loan anybody money recently?

693
00:43:34,192 --> 00:43:35,501
No.

694
00:43:35,568 --> 00:43:39,422
So you're not loaning money at high
rates out of the casino bathroom?

695
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:45,137
No. That sounds both
illegal and unsanitary.

696
00:43:45,203 --> 00:43:46,954
I have witnesses that say different.

697
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:50,391
[Darius] About my alibi or
about the bathroom loans?

698
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,186
Both.

699
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:56,815
Did they describe me?

700
00:43:57,423 --> 00:43:58,566
Yep.

701
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:04,948
Dark skin, long hair, scary-looking,
talked in an Indian accent?

702
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:06,849
Here's what they said.

703
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,852
They owed you money from illegal loans.

704
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:12,855
They won it back at the
casino on the way out.

705
00:44:12,856 --> 00:44:17,275
They got mugged, probably by you
or one of Malachi's other guys.

706
00:44:17,276 --> 00:44:21,255
So, you got your money back, and
they still think they owe you.

707
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:23,240
And I'm guessing you
raised the interest rates

708
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:25,051
when they didn't make the payments on time.

709
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:26,785
"Guessing"?

710
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:28,304
Am I under arrest for something?

711
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,102
Then don't let the door hit you in the ass.

712
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,146
[Ferg] The sheriff, he's a secretive guy.

713
00:44:54,147 --> 00:45:00,753
He doesn't always tell you what
he's thinking or doing or why.

714
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,172
[clears throat]

715
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:47,133
Well, this is a funny coincidence.

716
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,596
Well, I knew that you, uh, had
your group, uh, today, so I, um...

717
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:55,516
All right, Sheriff. What is this, hmm?

718
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:59,544
I assume you have a reason for
tracking me down twice in two days,

719
00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:02,481
but you seem to not
want to share it with me.

720
00:46:02,548 --> 00:46:05,568
Well, earlier I was apologizing.

721
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:09,655
No. You weren't.

722
00:46:09,722 --> 00:46:11,365
No, I was.

723
00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:13,534
I wasn't. Uh...

724
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:15,078
I guess I, um...

725
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:21,667
I-I guess I really, um,
didn't, um... didn't, um...

726
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,615
I mean, I did, um, somewhere
in the back of, um, my mind.

727
00:46:28,616 --> 00:46:31,910
But I, uh, was, um...

728
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:33,578
It's been a long time.

729
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:34,889
I'd, uh...

730
00:46:34,956 --> 00:46:38,458
I just feel we got off on
the wrong foot, obviously.

731
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:41,128
Um, I was hoping you
would forget about that,

732
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:46,276
and, uh, I'd like to ask you if
you'd like to go for dinner with me.

733
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,553
There. I said it. [chuckles]

734
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:52,573
I mean, sometime soon.

735
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:57,245
My God, that was excruciating.

736
00:46:57,311 --> 00:46:58,937
Yeah. Tell me about it.

737
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:01,791
It was like watching you pass
a kidney stone or something.

738
00:47:01,858 --> 00:47:04,252
It's been a very long time for me.

739
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:08,030
What do you say?

740
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,924
[clears throat] Well, I, um...

741
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:15,328
Well, I, um...

742
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:17,473
I think I'm gonna pass.

743
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,128
Oh.

744
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:26,858
Look, I know, um... I
know you must be mad at me.

745
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:28,609
No, no, no, that's not it. That's not it.

746
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:30,886
I know that you were just
trying to do your job, okay?

747
00:47:30,887 --> 00:47:33,264
But, you know, I just... I-I spend...

748
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:38,227
I spend all day trying to convince
manly men like yourself that...

749
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:40,562
that, you know, they should
deal with their emotions,

750
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:46,460
and I just don't want to do
the same thing on my free time.

751
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:48,129
So...

752
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,174
But that was very sweet.

753
00:47:57,663 --> 00:47:59,391
[sighs]

754
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:03,186
[rock music playing]

755
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:28,711
[telephone ringing]

756
00:48:37,787 --> 00:48:38,763
Hello?

757
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,498
The man who was mugged, you
said it was Joe Lone Elk?

758
00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:43,083
[Walt] Yeah. Why?

759
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:45,144
'Cause he just walked into my office...

760
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:50,174
my former office... with Darius.

761
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,567
And he looked scared.

762
00:48:51,634 --> 00:48:54,636
Darius claims to have an alibi
for the time of the mugging.

763
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,114
Not that I believe him.

764
00:48:56,973 --> 00:49:00,659
There is someone else with
him... a man named Lane Potter.

765
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,329
He is not a very good person.

766
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:06,815
How do you know him?

767
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:09,543
[Henry] Only by reputation.

768
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,947
But the fact that he is friends with
Darius confirms what I have heard.

769
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:16,717
You think this Lane
Potter works for Darius?

770
00:49:16,784 --> 00:49:18,511
It certainly looks that way.

771
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:20,138
Thanks, Henry.

772
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:30,940
[Travis] Mom! Door!

773
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:37,304
- Well, look who's here.
- Ms. Murphy, I was, uh, wondering...

774
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:40,492
I'm surprised you have the nerve
to show your face at this house.

775
00:49:41,142 --> 00:49:43,935
Do you have any idea how hard Travis worked

776
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:47,623
to get ready for your job
interview, how much it meant to him?

777
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,417
And you wouldn't even give him a chance.

778
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:52,819
- I appreciate your son's passion...
- Oh, you most certainly do not.

779
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,964
[Travis] Mom! Who is it?

780
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:57,509
[Mary Jo] Sheriff High Horse.

781
00:49:57,575 --> 00:49:59,034
[chuckles] Let him in.

782
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:02,555
Why? So he can come here
and trample your dreams?

783
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:04,581
Mom! Please!

784
00:50:04,582 --> 00:50:06,518
I'm sorry about that, Sheriff.

785
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:08,835
My mom can be, uh, a little overprotective.

786
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:10,396
There you go.

787
00:50:10,463 --> 00:50:13,858
[police radio chatter]

788
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:16,068
So, uh, what's up?

789
00:50:16,135 --> 00:50:21,056
I just need to, um, clarify a few
things about your, uh... your notes.

790
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:22,575
Yeah, absolutely.

791
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:23,934
You wrote 12:22.

792
00:50:23,935 --> 00:50:27,580
Is that the time you encountered, uh,
Jerry, or was that when he was attacked?

793
00:50:27,646 --> 00:50:30,065
Uh...

794
00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:32,025
Maybe. Uh...

795
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:34,253
Maybe it's when we arrived back at the car.

796
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,921
Uh-huh.

797
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:38,508
What about this one?

798
00:50:38,574 --> 00:50:40,343
It says "car."

799
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:45,390
Did Jerry give a description of
the car that ran him off the road?

800
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:48,393
Maybe?

801
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,400
Come on, Travis.

802
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:58,218
Now I got a new suspect,
man named Lane Potter.

803
00:50:58,219 --> 00:50:59,970
He drives a blue Honda.

804
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:03,282
Is there any chance that you
and Jerry talked about the car?

805
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:07,894
Okay. I remember now. Car.

806
00:51:07,895 --> 00:51:12,291
Um, he was just saying that it wasn't
the car that drove him off the road.

807
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:16,421
Well, that's what... He
wasn't talking about that car.

808
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:18,631
Okay. What was it?

809
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:22,075
Well, Jerry was saying that he wishes that
he'd have driven his own car that night,

810
00:51:22,076 --> 00:51:24,453
that things might have turned
out a little bit differently

811
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:27,848
if, uh, his buddy didn't wind
up having to drive him home.

812
00:51:45,391 --> 00:51:46,850
Thanks, Travis.

813
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:48,035
[Travis] Yeah.

814
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:51,289
[door closes]

815
00:51:57,487 --> 00:51:59,213
[knock on door]

816
00:52:02,783 --> 00:52:05,743
[Henry] Those are so you can kick my ass.

817
00:52:05,744 --> 00:52:07,763
[sighs] Henry.

818
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:16,547
I was an idiot earlier, and I am sorry.

819
00:52:16,548 --> 00:52:18,691
I thought I owed you an explanation.

820
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:22,260
No. You don't.

821
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:23,803
I get it.

822
00:52:23,804 --> 00:52:25,889
And after what happened with Gab,

823
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,410
it'd be weird if you
weren't a little cynical.

824
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:31,520
Well, you came in with a
big heart trying to help,

825
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:36,041
and I just rained all over your idealism.

826
00:52:38,903 --> 00:52:40,338
It's okay.

827
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,091
Come in. I'll get you a beer.

828
00:52:45,451 --> 00:52:46,577
Thanks.

829
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:50,997
I was just feeling
powerless and frustrated.

830
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:52,308
I know the feeling.

831
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,186
That's why I was trying to do something.

832
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:05,470
So, what happens with a case like
Gab's when the victim will not testify?

833
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:09,074
Does it just... go away?

834
00:53:10,976 --> 00:53:14,288
Those two guys... Does anything
at all show up on their records?

835
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:18,042
No. They go Scot-free.

836
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:25,174
Do you still have your files?

837
00:53:26,618 --> 00:53:28,802
On the rape case? Yeah.

838
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:33,307
Are there... pictures of Gab's assailants?

839
00:53:33,374 --> 00:53:35,626
I think so. Why?

840
00:53:35,627 --> 00:53:37,895
[Henry] I was wondering
if I could see them.

841
00:53:38,963 --> 00:53:42,591
I find myself looking at every
man who comes into the bar

842
00:53:42,592 --> 00:53:44,676
and imagining he is one of them.

843
00:53:44,677 --> 00:53:47,387
It is difficult to provide
quality customer service

844
00:53:47,388 --> 00:53:48,822
under those circumstances.

845
00:53:58,774 --> 00:54:00,858
Here they are.

846
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:02,294
Here you go.

847
00:54:03,446 --> 00:54:05,673
Oh, I'll get you that beer.

848
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,894
[camera shutter clicks]

849
00:54:22,715 --> 00:54:24,149
[camera shutter clicks]

850
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:05,608
You need some help?

851
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:09,737
Oh. Hey, Sheriff. I
didn't hear you drive up.

852
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:11,929
I parked up the road a bit.

853
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,098
I didn't want to disturb you.

854
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:15,827
I didn't want you to run off.

855
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:17,561
No danger of that.

856
00:55:17,562 --> 00:55:18,704
[Walt] Right.

857
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:22,166
I guess I meant to say I
didn't want you to drive off.

858
00:55:23,025 --> 00:55:24,042
Oh.

859
00:55:24,943 --> 00:55:29,173
Anyway, I got to thinking that this
cross was a little too close to the road.

860
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,676
I was afraid somebody might knock it down.

861
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:33,744
I'm thinking I'm gonna
build a little grotto here

862

so that Pete's father and family can
come by and light candles for him.

863
00:55:37,998 --> 00:55:41,477
At night when it's all lit
up, that's gonna be beautiful.

864
00:55:42,169 --> 00:55:44,689
Can you hand me that cross there?

865
00:55:46,507 --> 00:55:49,109
Why'd you lie to me, Jerry?

866
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,029
Why'd you say you needed a ride out here?

867
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:53,698
You got a car.

868
00:55:57,643 --> 00:56:00,562
Those hand controls...

869
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:01,854
how do they work?

870
00:56:01,855 --> 00:56:05,233
Push down to brake, pull back
towards you to accelerate.

871
00:56:05,234 --> 00:56:07,336
I just got it out of the shop.

872
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:10,548
You got a receipt for that work?

873
00:56:11,156 --> 00:56:13,825
Your car wasn't in the shop.

874
00:56:13,826 --> 00:56:19,223
You needed me... Not to drive you, to
show you where the shooting happened.

875
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:21,666
- Well, yes, so I could put my cross up.
- No.

876
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:24,102
So you could find what
you left behind that night.

00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,066
[Walt] You were never robbed, Jerry.

Of course we were, just like those
other people you told me about.

You shot Peter Hoyt.

Oh, well.

884
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:16,781
It was worth a try.

885
00:57:18,557 --> 00:57:20,642
I never really thought I'd get away with it

886
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:23,078
until you told me about
those other robberies.

887
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,749
So, what happened that night?

888
00:57:29,193 --> 00:57:34,214
I told him to pull over 'cause I was
having a problem with my colostomy bag.

889
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:38,576
And when he came around to the
side of the car to help me out,

890
00:57:38,577 --> 00:57:42,222
I shot him... right in the face.

891
00:57:42,289 --> 00:57:44,182
For this?

892
00:57:46,126 --> 00:57:48,854
I don't think you killed him for $3,000.

893
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:50,982
No.

894
00:57:56,387 --> 00:57:58,971
Then why don't you tell me why?

895
00:57:58,972 --> 00:58:00,407
[Jerry] Oh, I don't know.

896
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:03,393
Maybe the colostomy bag.

897
00:58:03,394 --> 00:58:06,354
Or the chronic nightmares.

898
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:11,168
Or the itch I imagine
in my dead, useless foot.

899
00:58:11,777 --> 00:58:14,463
I had a lot of reasons, Sheriff.

900
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:20,385
I just knew I was never gonna be okay
until I erased him from this earth.

901
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:24,831
And then I got to thinking

902
00:58:24,832 --> 00:58:29,102
that that $3,000 would come
in handy for my medical bills.

903
00:58:29,754 --> 00:58:32,105
But that was kind of stupid.

904
00:58:34,383 --> 00:58:36,193
So you never forgave him.

905
00:58:39,304 --> 00:58:42,157
I'm not so sure forgiveness exists.

906
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,476

trying to talk themselves

they know is horseshit.

And I don't know what I would
have done if that had happened.

916

Planning his death was
all that kept me alive.

Father Donahue told me that
forgiveness would bring me peace.

He was wrong.

consider unforgivable.
