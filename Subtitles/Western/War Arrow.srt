00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,955
Whoa! Easy, boy.

2
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,962
Whoa, there. Whoa.

3
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,867
Ah.

4
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,869
Souvenir.
Of what?

5
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:48,874
Oh, the great Southwest,
the dangerous
Indian territory.

6
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,809
[Chuckles]
Hey, Sarge, ya know,

7
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,712
this is gonna make
somethin" nice to hang
on the wall when I retire,

8
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,216
somethin" I can tell
my grandkids lies about.

9
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,219
That arrow"s
at least a year old.
Rick up a fresh one.

10
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,620
Listen, Sarge, I think
the arrow"s extinct.

11
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,092
<i>Couple of weeks,</i>
<i>you'll be pullin' 'em</i>
<i>out of your back.</i>

12
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,426
I heard that in St. Louis
a thousand miles ago.

13
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:15,992
By now, I thought we"d be
hackin" our way through
a solid wall of Indian fesh.

14
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,403
Wait until you run into Satanta,
chief of the Kiowas.
You"ll know you met an Indian.

15
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:25,501
Oh, he"s a tough one, huh?
<i>Got his whole tepee covered</i>
<i>with buck sergeants'chevrons.</i>

16
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:31,244
The only fella gonna
get those stripes is the fella
I give "em to after I got yours.

17
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,413
<i>[Sergeant Chuckles]</i>
All right, let"s get
movin" back there!

18
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,279
Comanches?

19
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:16,420
Comanches would have
taken a prisoner.
That"s a Kiowa specialty.

20
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,432
Ricket the horses while
I try to find a shovel.

21
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,526
Great place for souvenirs.

22
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,254
Detail reporting
to Colonel Meade.

23
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,889
Open the gate!

24
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,830

<i>Forward, go!</i>

28
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,678
Major Howell Brady,
Sergeants Luke Schermerhorn
and Agustus Wilks...

29
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,690
reporting
from St. Louis, sir.

30
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,750
How do you do?
Captain Neil,
Lieutenant Rolier.

31
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,762
Still a sergeant,
eh, Schermerhorn?

32
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,766
I guess soldiers
are like water.
They find their own level.

33
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,270
Rour the sergeants
a bath and a drink:
the drink first.

34
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,271
Come along, Major.

35
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,446
You"re to be quartered here
for six months under
nobody"s orders but your own.

36
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,447
Those are
Gen. Schofield"s words.

37
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,450
I don"t like it, even
from the secretary of war.

38
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,646
That"s natural.
This is good whiskey.

39
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,248
Washington doesn"t have
to send anybody around,
investigating my command.

40
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
As far as I know,
they haven"t.

41
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,263
Then what is it?
Major Howell Brady
taking over this fort?

42
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,265
l"ve already
turned down three.

43
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,769
l"ve been in this army
too many years to be fooled.

44
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,772
Things haven"t gone well here,
and they"ve retired
generals for less.

45
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,037
I haven"t heard talk
of retiring you.
Your record shows...

46
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,809
I know. But you"re as good
as your last casualty list.

47
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,851
All right,
l"ll play the game.
Game?

48
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,911
By elimination, you must
be here to fight Indians.
Yeah. That"s about it.

49
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,426
One major and two sergeants
is not what l"d call
a fighting outfit.

50
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,429
<i>Well, it's a start.</i>
What can you do
that I haven"t done?

51
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,661
The Kiowas are having
a field day, but why?
<i>Nobody's stopping them.</i>

52
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,670
They don"t come out
by the hundreds
and thousands anymore.

53
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,174
They raid by 10s and 20s.
They hit and they"re gone.

54
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:46,177
I know. I saw
some of their work
a few miles back.

55
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,406
Family named McMurdo.

56
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,884
At least they"re buried
under a cross.
Crude, but a cross.

57
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,887
How can I stop this
with only one command?

58
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,890
You might break it up
into companies
or platoons,

59
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,926
send "em riding
in all directions.

60
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,928
That"s what the Kiowas want.
They"d cut us to ribbons.

61
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:08,933
The only hope for law
is to keep this command intact.
When it"s gone, the Kiowas rule.

62
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,094
They seem
to be ruling now.

63
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,233
If you"re here
to fight Indians, Major,
there"s a lot of work waiting.

64
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,106
I hear you have Seminoles
in this territory.

65
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:26,242
Yeah, a small tribe up by Golden.
At least they"re peaceful.

66
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,287
You know their chief,
Maygro?

67
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:32,290
<i>Not personally,</i>
<i>but I fought against</i>
<i>his father in Florida.</i>

68
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,725
- What"s your opinion of them?
- For eight years in Florida,

69
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:40,926
they held back almost every
regiment of the army, marines,
the navy and 50,000 militia.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,434
All that
with just 400 warriors.

71
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,495
<i>Incredible, wasn't it?</i>
Heh. Expensive too.

72
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:51,100
The government had to scatter
them all over the country so
there wouldn"t be another war.

73
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,806
Now they"re a poor
tribe of vagabonds
living in sod huts...

74
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,076
and trying to raise
a few scrawny sheep.

75
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,118
But they
can still fight.

76
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,119
Fight who?
Kiowas.

77
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,123
You couldn"t get
a Seminole Indian to fight
for his sister"s virtue.

78
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,716
Why not?
They"ve laid down
their guns for good.

79
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,729
The Kiowas run
through their village
Just for sport.

80
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,732
Could you get me
three fresh horses
and $500?

81
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,327
Anything, Major.
l"ll have you quartered
within the hour.

82
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,837
Well, don"t bother
with anything elaborate.

83
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:24,639
l"ll move Mrs. Corwin
out of Capt. Corwin"s house.
He was killed recently.

84
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,644
Rlease don"t inconvenience
anyone for me.

85
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,647
<i>There's room for the woman</i>
<i>at my place.</i>
You"re the C.O.

86
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,684
By the way,
there"s a birthday party
at my house tonight.

87
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:36,552
That hardly gives me time
to buy a present.

88
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,352
Don"t bother.
You"ve already given me one:

89
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,359
the funniest story
of the year.

90
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,988
Seminoles fighting Kiowas.
[Laughing]

91
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,714
Happy birthday, Colonel.
Thank you, Major.

92
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,979
Excuse me.
Certainly.

93
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:11,012
<i>So I told him he had to be</i>
<i>in full uniform at all times.</i>
<i>[Laughing]</i>

94
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,059
The colonel"s special blend.

95
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,104
Major Howell Brady,
ma"am.

96
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,107
I came to dance,
if you"d do me
the honor.

97
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,109
We were holding
a conversation, Major.

98
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,510
You should try
holding a girl
sometime, Captain.

99
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:41,709
I have a feeling that patience
is not one of your
stronger virtues, Major.

100
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,756
[Chuckles]
Consider the life span
of the average human,

101
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,227
then subtract
all the minutes we waste
in meaningless formalities.

102
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,391
Criminal.
There"s little enough time
for small pleasures as it is.

103
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,900
As I live and breathe,
a philosopher.

104
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,903
[Chuckles]
A... a realist.

105
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:03,271
Well, whatever you are,
l"m glad someone
finally asked me to dance.

106
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,938
Is there something
about you I should know?
l"m Mrs. Corwin.

107
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,716
l"m, uh, sorry about having
taken over your house.

108
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,719
The fortunes of war, Major.

109
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,723
Besides, any man
who"s held every rank
from private to major,

110
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,727
won a field commission,
been breveted twice
for exceptional gallantry...

111
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,729
and won the Congressional
Medal of Honor,

112
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:29,734
there just isn"t enough
that we can do for him.
Who told you all that?

113
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,635
Col. Meade, and not
without a little envy.

114
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,835
Oh, ah, l"m taking
a room in his house.
Yes, so I heard.

115
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,936
And he who gossips
will be out chasing Kiowas
in the morning.

116
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,413
[Chuckles]
They should be anyway.

117
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,416
Don"t you go, Major.

118
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,816
We"ve lost too many
good dancers already.

121
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,626
When did it happen?

122
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,937
About six months ago
on a scouting party.

123
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,477
He must"ve been
quite a man...

124
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,879
<i>for his memory to have</i>
<i>kept you single</i>
<i>on the frontier this long.</i>

126
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,213
Bad training.

127
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,451
There are times when
the individual soldier...

128
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,652
is much more effective
than the unit.

129
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,185
You"re an exponent of
the one-man frontal attack.

130
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,164
Yes, but I believe
in cautious
reconnoitering first.

131
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,896
Better be careful, Major.
You"re revealing
your position to the enemy.

132
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,404
Enjoy your waltz, Major?
Were we waltzing?

133
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,498
It was more like
a musical fencing match.

134
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,839
I couldn"t get
past her guard.
Nobody ever does.

135
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,572
She"s a greater threat
to this post than the Kiowas.

136
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,811
- Something oughta be done.
- You"ll have to go
to the end of the line.

137
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,820
Not him.
He doesn"t waste his time
on meaningless formalities.

138
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,153
Major Brady, perhaps you"d
tell our younger officers...

139
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,159
of your experiences
fighting the Cheyenne.

140
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,526
They look
about as friendly
as the Cheyenne.

141
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,565
A later dance,
Mrs. Corwin?

142
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,830

Write "Elaine" on your card.
Thank you.

145
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,403
I hear he came
from St. Louis
and Washington.

146
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,412
He"s still
Just another soldier.

147
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,471
Well, tell me,
what"s he doing here?

148
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,609
Trying to get Seminoles
to fight Kiowas.

149
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,053
Why, Colonel,
you"re jealous of him.

I always knew you were
a brave man, Major,

154
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,134

ain"t recommended,

155

That"s
Capt. Corwin"s widow.
Oh. l"m sorry.

157
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,019
I always figured
that Corwin was
too ornery to die.

158
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,526
Them Kiowas ain"t choosy
about who they kill.

Yeah, I knew him.

00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,193
It"d take more
than a few Indians
to keep me away from that.

161
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,549
We"re ridin" in a noose.
I know.
Care to pick a number?

162
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,557
At least five,
or they"d be afraid.

163
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,355
Not 10,
or they"d have cut loose.

164
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,419
Seven.
Lucky seven.

165
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,989
We"ll have
to fight our way out.
Yeah.

166
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,594
Rrobably try to catch us
at that other rise.

167
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:03,574
Tell Wilks to keep
his eyes front.
He don"t
even know they"re up there.

168
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,202
<i>He's got barroom eyes.</i>

169
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,611
When we reach that rim,
we"ll go into a run.

170
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,616
Come over it shooting.

171
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,051
l"ll take the left.
You and Wilks
take the right.

172
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:22,093
[Laughing] How about
them fellas tellin" us
it was dangerous...

173
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,927
for just the three of us
to ride in this country?

174
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,434
They call this Coffin Rim.
It"s not famous for the births
that have happened here.

175
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:35,462
l"ll bet you a dollar
there ain"t an Indian
within 10 miles.

176
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,476
You got a bet.
How"re we gonna prove it?

177
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:43,481
Easy. Four Kiowas have
got you in their sights now.
Don"t look up!

178
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,178
Are you serious?
When we hit that ridge,
you do as I do...

179
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,950
if you want to live long enough
for another promotion.
Yes, sir.

180
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:29,449
Uh, you fellas
is lucky I was along.

181
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,122
You"re right. I just
made an easy dollar.

182
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,256
Wilks and I will do
some cleaning up.

183
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,268
You contact the Seminoles
and tell them what I said.

184
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,270
l"ll do what I can.
All right.

185
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,102
Schermerhorn,
I hate to bring this up,

186
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:47,111
but don"t you think
I oughta hold the dollar?
Just in case.

187
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,116
Uh-uh. If anything happens,
l"m gonna need some
gambling money where l"m going.

188
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,822
Well, that Schermerhorn.

189
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,301
That feller could charm
the Rocky Mountains into
goin" south for the winter.

190
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,242
Rsst!

191
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,393
My father, Chief Maygro,
said to give you
some food while he talks.

192
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:38,726
Rabbit, eh?
We call it Texas buffalo.

193
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,856
Say, you talk English
real good.

194
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,369
Why shouldn"t I?
I went to school
in San Antonio.

195
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,370
<i>[Wilks]</i>
<i>What's your name, honey?</i>

196
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,841
Avis. It means bird.
And do not speak
of putting salt on my tail.

197
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,709
[Laughing]
Some fella already
beat me to it, huh?

198
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,749
Uh, my name is Wilks.
Sergeant Wilks.

199
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,751
And this fella here...
I forget his name.

200
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,878
Anyway, he"s married
and got 16 kids.

201
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,219
You make him
sound interesting.
[Clears Throat]

202
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,623
Uh, you like
this life out here?
I hate it.

203
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,755
Would you like to spend
your life in a mud hut
with corn husks for beds...

204
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,765
and rabbit
for food every day?

205
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,768
Well, uh, I might
if you was with me.

206
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,771
I won"t be.
l"m going someplace.
Any particular place?

207
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,774
Anywhere. It couldn"t
be worse than this.

208
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,436
Maybe you and I could
work something out.

209
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,446
What I want,
you don"t have.

210
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,448
<i>[Luke Laughing]</i>
<i>Oh, try me.</i>

211
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,384
Good food and clothes
and a decent place to live?

212
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,648
Well, that sure
lets out enlisted men.

213
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,486
What"s your father
think about all this?

214
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,358
My father will not
let me leave.
<i>He won't? How come?</i>

215
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,126
He says there"s only one way
to get the things I want.

216
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,066
He could be right.
<i>I don't care.</i>

217
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,764
I know what I want.
l"m going to get it.
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

218
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,933
There"s a lot to be said
for bein" a nice girl.

219
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,445
Weren"t you just suggesting
we could work something out?

220
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,972
I didn"t mean...
Who are you to tell me
what is nice and what isn"t?

221
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,578
When I get the chance,
I will leave and
I will do what I want.

222
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,256
<i>Then you want us</i>
<i>to help you fight the Kiowa?</i>

223
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,263
That"s right, Maygro.
You Seminoles.

224
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,697
We are Kanyuksa Indians
from Florida.

225
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,362
Among our people,
"Seminole" is not a good word.

226
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,371
All right, Kanyuksa.

227
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,373
We number 300,

228
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,410
maybe 25 men
who could fight.

229
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,446
That"s more than enough.

230
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,143
I try to understand...
We have to fight the Kiowas
on their own terms.

231
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,652
A small, fast-moving,
hard-hitting force,

232
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,655
one that knows the country,
understands the language,

233
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,920
has endurance and doesn"t
ask any luxuries.

234
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,325
Why should we do this
for you?

235
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,832
For six months" service,
the government will give you
land of your own.

236
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,835
Like this?
No, this will be
green land...

237
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,838
with water and cattle,
trees to build houses with.

238
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,897
Where is this land?

239
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,466
The whole
Santa Media Valley.

240
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,275
But to get it,
we must fight.
Yeah.

241
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,646
That is one thing
we cannot do.

242
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,517
Aw! We make foolish journey
to come here.

243
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,647
Why don"t you
ask your people?

244
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,954
I am the law
of the Kanyuksas.

245
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,960
I say no.

246
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,962
You afraid, Maygro?

247
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,826
Come.
We speak with others.

248
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,340
Tell us, how will
our families eat
when men are gone?

249
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,841
The army will send
supplies every month.

250
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,938
Meantime,
$500 until the first
supply train comes.

251
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,074
We have put down
our guns for good.

252
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,983
Fighting will only lose us
the peace we find.

253
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,987
Reace?
You mean hunger!

254
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,853
Let me die fighting,
not from peaceful
starvation!

255
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:57,123
Rino, you"re too young
to remember what war did
to the Kanyuksa.

256
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,187
When you have to fight,
you fight!

257
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,425
Even a snake
or gopher knows that.

258
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,434
Are we to sit around...

259
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,096
and watch the Kiowas
run through our camp
for sport?

260
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:10,608
<i>The young men have the heart,</i>
<i>but we have no weapons!</i>

261
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,110
If I had a gun,
I would show them...

262
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,615
that the Kanyuksa have at least
as much courage as gopher!
Rino, sit down!

263
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,174
When elders speak,
you listen. Sit down!

264
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,325
I am your leader.

265
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,623
When we were
driven from Florida,

266
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,630
we pledged to keep peace.

267
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,632
We knew it would be hard.

268
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,033
You want new leader,
say so.

269
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,934
Then as long as I am
Maygro, your leader,

270
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,603
I do what I think best.

271
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,942
You"re less than women!

272
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:53,781
l"m ashamed that
I talked to you as equals,
as men of courage!

273
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,913
Major!

274
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,926
<i>[Shouting, Whooping]</i>

275
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,823
<i>[Luke]</i>
<i>Kiowas!</i>

276
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,012
Well, at least you got
six more horses.

277
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,113
I never saw gun
shoot like that.

278
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,125
Fifteen times without reloading.
It"s a Henry repeating rife.

279
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,629
This is the weapon you"ll have.
Makes one man equal to 30.

280
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,631
You teach
strong lesson.

281
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,692
I always said whoever called
the Kanyuksas "Seminoles"
was right.

282
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,137
That"s all they ever were:
Seminoles, cowards,
and renegades.

283
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,731
Avis, this is no time
for such talk.

284
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,936
You might yet turn out
to be men.

285
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:58,005
- No one will give you anything
unless you fight for it.
- Quiet. We will go with Major.

286
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,916
I know,
and I am going with you.

287
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,514
You will stay in village
where you belong
with the rest of the women.

288
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,753
Try and keep me there.

289
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,478
Hey, Schermerhorn,
you captured
the wrong Indians.

290
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,390
Them ain"t fighters:
they"re sheep eaters.

291
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,760
l"m beginnin" to feel a little foolish.
You got the face
to go with it.

292
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,765
I guess you"re right.

293
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:57,065
Colonel, this is Maygro...
Who said these Seminoles
were to be quartered?

294
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,576
The orders,
some of the fine print.

295
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,511
You don"t pull
sleeping quarters
out of the air.

296
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,517
Give "em a gun and a horse
and they"ll be gone
by tomorrow morning.

297
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,520
The Kanyuksas will...
l"m talking
to the major!

298
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,522
Go on, Maygro.

299
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,856
The Kanyuksas will not go.
They will fight well
for land and food promised.

300
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,862
What land?
What food?
The Santa Media Valley,

301
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,865
and a wagon train to
their families every month.

302
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,867
I need all the supplies
I have!

303
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,371
The supplies will
be ready at the nearest
army railhead monthly.

304
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,498
You just furnish
the transportation.

305
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,610
Where are you going?

306
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,346
To Major Brady"s house
to stay with my father.

307
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,355
<i>That would not be good.</i>

308
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,824
They put me in a tent
worse than the hut
I came from.

309
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,124
If you would marry me,
I would build a house for us.

310
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,630
What will you build?
Ajackal hut?

311
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:58,192
Made of handsome sod
and magnificent mud?
No, Rino. Never.

312
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,570
A house is good because of
how you live in it,
not how it is made.

313
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,575
That is not for me!

314
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,342
<i>Hello.</i>

315
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,211
l"m Mrs. Corwin.
Elaine Corwin.

316
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,376
My name is Avis.

317
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,286
Your dress
is very pretty.

318
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:24,522
Thank you.
Coming from another woman,
that"s the highest compliment.

319
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,564
Did it cost much?

320
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,965
No. I made it myself.
You can"t buy ready-made
dresses out here.

321
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,632
Someday l"ll have
a dress prettier than that.

322
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,869
l"ll show you how to make one
with my patterns.

323
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,573
If I had the cloth,
I could sew it myself.
<i>I might have some cloth too.</i>

324
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,741
Thank you,
but l"ll get my own.

325
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,760
<i>Afternoon, Mrs. Corwin.</i>

326
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,661
Hello, Major.

327
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:04,327
You"re about to have a new
resident in your house.
Oh, homesick already?

328
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:09,704
As far as l"m concerned,
one house is the same
as another on an army post.

329
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,436
l"m disappointed.

330
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,911
l"m fattered
by your disappointment.

331
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,346
And l"m properly
put in my place.

332
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,145
About my new resident...
It"s Avis.

333
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,152
I understand
she"s moving in.

334
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,348
I guess she wants
to be near her father.
Uh-uh.

335
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,051
She"s dying to have
a dress like mine,

336
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,653
probably so her father
will realize
how pretty she is.

337
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,721
Or Rino.
Or you.

338
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,864
She has a kind
of untamed charm.

339
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,773
They say that a wild plant
never lives very long indoors.

340
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,801
<i>I'm gonna be too busy</i>
<i>to conduct social experiments.</i>

341
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,373
Speaking of experiments,
the talk is that you"ll
never train the Seminoles.

342
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,544
The only thing that talk
ever trained is a parrot.

343
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,681
By the way, they don"t like
to be called Seminoles.
Oh?

344
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:03,660
Suppose we discuss it later?
Be all right?

345
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,753
Very well.

346
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,820
Well, your men are ready.
I gave "em each a horse
and a Henry repeater.

347
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,493
These guns will speak
their own answer
to the colonel.

348
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,004
Just load "em up on Sunday,
and they"ll shoot all week.

349
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,973
For you.

350
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,870
Well, you can"t see
through the paper,
you know.

351
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,050
Oh.
There"s enough
material for a dress,

352
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,059
pattern, needles, thread.

353
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:14,292
If you need any more help,
I can"t give it to you.
Thank you.

354
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,301
Hope it"ll give you
something to do.

355
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,735
She told you,
didn"t she?
Yeah.

356
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,433
l"ll be a better woman
than she is.

357
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:27,069
What do you do
with your old losers, Major?

358
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,983
All right, now, keep
your elbow on your knee.

359
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,983
The stock dug
into your shoulder.

360
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,990
That"s it.
Just like that.

361
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,221
Rick your targets
carefully,

362
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,455
every shot.

363
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,464
All right, Luke.

364
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,693
Take a steady grip
and squeeze.

365
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:53,829
Don"t pull the trigger,
or you"ll jerk the barrel
off the target.

366
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:59,241
Keep this little ball
Just underneath what you"re
aimin" at, like this.

367
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,743
<i>[Gunshots]</i>

368
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,754

<i>[Brady Chuckling]</i>

374
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,882
l"m not sure
this is such a good idea.

375
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:47,391
What?
Leaving the fort after dark.

376
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,393
Could get mighty dangerous
out here.

377
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,952
Everything"s dangerous
in this country.

378
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,089
I know.

379
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:58,625
I mean, danger doesn"t stop
at the walls of the fort.

380
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,898
I know that too.

381
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,839
Why, even in your own home.

382
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,844
Once I walked
into my living room,
and there was a rattler.

383
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,142
Gave me quite a start.

384
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,115
Once I walked into a room...

385
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:16,517
and there was one of the most
beautiful women l"ve ever seen.

386
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,783
<i>Gave me quite a start.</i>

387
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:26,091
Anyway, if I didn"t get
outside once in a while,
l"d go crazy.

388
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:29,156
Sometimes the fort seems
Just like a prison.

389
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,296
Why do you stay on?

390
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:38,206
Oh, it isn"t easy for
a woman to pull up roots
and start traveling.

391
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,212
Colonel Meade
wouldn"t have anything
to do with it, would he?

392
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,214
Why do you ask that?

393
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,844
Because he"s entirely
too paternal for a man
who isn"t the fatherly type.

394
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,854
l"m very fond
ofjack as a friend.

395
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,447
Nothing more,
and he knows it.

396
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,722
A smart officer prepares
for a long campaign.

397
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,993
He"d have the same luck
with me that he"s having
with the Kiowas.

398
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,693
That seems to be true
for everybody.

399
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:07,226
Something tells me
that you"ll do
a little better.

400
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,205
With you?

401
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,435
I was thinking
about the Kiowas.

402
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,670
Oh.

403
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,679
I don"t know.

404
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,012
Their raids aren"t haphazard.
There"s a plan behind them.

405
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,575
l"m sorry
I even mentioned it.

406
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,918
All right, pick a subject.

407
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:30,086
Something far away,
something like
Washington or St. Louis.

408
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:34,097
Oh, the buildings
hem you in and the noise
wears you down.

409
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,099
l"ve had
a warehouseful of quiet.

410
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,102
Tell me about the parties
and the dresses...

411
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,468
and the crystal
and the silver.

412
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,633
And the colds and bad food
and the empty conversation?

413
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,700
Oh, sounds wonderful.

414
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,976
To be sitting with a cold
in a noisy restaurant
in Washington...

415
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,212
listening
to bad conversation,

416
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,254
l"d give all the love
that"s in me.

417
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,223
Now or when you get there?

418
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,818
l... I don"t know what
made me say that.

419
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,221
Don"t you?

420
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:19,407
Do your plans really
include a return
to the East?

421
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,914
I don"t know, except...
Well, then why don"t
we talk about it...

422
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,542
when you really know
where you"re going?

423
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,471
All right, Wilks,
take over.
Yes, sir.

424
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,440
Now, you all know
how to sit on a horse.

425
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,501
l"m gonna show you
how to jump a horse!

426
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,540

When the time comes,
you"ll have to dig"em
faster and deeper.

430
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,048
Man should not
fight in hole.
He should stand erect.

431
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,382
And get his head shot off?

432
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,653
In case of a sudden attack,
this is what we"ll use
these trenches for. Ready?

work this hard.
That"s
why we"re out here. Come on.

437
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:04,012
He"s training those Seminoles
like a cross between Kentucky
frontiersmen and rustlers.

Digging holes,
firing dismounted,
charging four at a time.

To fight Indians, you"ve got
to give "em a spectacle.
Stun "em, make noise.

440
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:18,895
l"d like to be looking on

its first party of Kiowas.

441
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,397
Those lads
aren"t interested
in playing games.

442
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,027
It"ll take him a month
to round up
his Seminoles again.

443
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,300
One way or another,
l"d like to see it.

What an alarming
lack of confidence.
It isn"t like you.

If we ever get
the Kiowas in line,

464
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,510
I can just about pick
my next assignment.

465
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,604
l"ve had enough
of this special frontier duty
to warrant it.

You"re very fortunate,
Major.

467
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:49,380
I thought I might ask

the A.G. office
or something like that.

00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,457
Where the buildings
hem you in and the noise
wears you down.

470
00:34:55,526 --> 00:35:00,293
When a man has nothing
but time on his hands,
no one to share it with,

471
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,696
he concentrates
on noise and cold.

472
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,793
He has to blame
his loneliness on something.

a very good job of this,

l"m in love with you.

I know.
I wish you hadn"t.

476
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,350
The other night,
that was one thing.

477
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:25,947
l"m sorry for it.
This is different.
No, it"s worse.

478
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:30,426
l-I don"t understand.
It"s really very simple.
l"m not in love with you.

479
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,430
You haven"t given
yourself time
to think about it.

480
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:37,161
I don"t have to think
about it. I know.
I don"t believe that.

481
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,296
You and your supreme ego, Major.

Unless we find
their leaders,

645
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,531
it will take us
the rest of our lives
to wipe out the Kiowas.

646
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:15,332
The Kiowa talked.

647
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,772
I don"t believe in torture.
He would have
killed himself anyway.

648
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,072
He not return
to tribe disgraced.

649
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:25,376
We"re trying to bring
law into this territory.
Yet, one life for many.

650
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,384
Rino!
There is a white man.

651
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:32,513
Corwin.
He was officer in your army.

652
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,217
<i>He lead Kiowa raids.</i>

653
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,697
Where does he hide out?

654
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:45,201
Many place.
He move every day.
He has heard of us.

655
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:50,399
What"d I tell ya?
Any outfit Agustus Wilks joins
becomes immortal overnight.

656
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,907
He worries.

657
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,876
When war parties
do not come back,

658
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:59,245
people and their chief Satanta
ask questions.

659
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,250
Anything else?

660
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:06,187
He know, to rule this land,
he must destroy fort.

661
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,952
When was that
scheduled for?

662
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,653
Not for long time.
But because of us,

663
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:14,322
and doubt spread
among his tribes,

664
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,763
he will be forced
to do it soon.

665
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,825
<i>Any day.</i>
The fort isn"t easy
to defend...

666
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,894
with a hill
looking down on it.

667
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,908
They had to build it
where the fresh water was.

668
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,809
Let"s go back
and get us a drink.

669
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,329
Did you learn
anything about...
Yeah.

670
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,596
He"s...
He"s still alive?

671
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,103
Still alive.

672
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,542
What"s your claim
this time, Major?

673
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:11,143
Twenty raiding parties.
Would you like
to see the bodies?

674
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,950
That"s a nice,
round number.

675
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,288
l"m too tired to play
word games today.

676
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:21,023
You"ll get my written report
in the morning.
Should be stirring stuff.

677
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:26,797
Is it true you do not send
supplies to my people?
That door"s to knock on!

678
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,895
Before I cut you
in two, tell me!

679
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:32,874
You enlisted in this army
as a scout. l"m a colonel!

680
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:35,537
There are limits
to the liberties
you can take with me!

681
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,842
Tell me!

682
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,506
Did you send
the supplies?
No.

683
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:44,885
We kept our word!
Why you not keep your word?
I gave you no word!

684
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:48,391
But I did,
through an authority
higher than yours.

685
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,982
What are my people to eat?
Dirt?

686
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,325
The supplies
haven"t arrived
from the Army depot.

687
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:57,765
When they do, l"ll let
you know. Until then, get
out of my office, Maygro!

688
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:06,000
You can"t
treat him like that.
He"s a chief!

689
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,772
Of what?
A worthless band
of vagabonds?

690
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:13,043
Now, if there"s
nothing else, Major...
There"s a lot else, Colonel!

691
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:16,882
Capt. Corwin is alive
and directing
the Indian raids.

692
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:18,420
Who told you that?
A Kiowa.

693
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,752
Huh.
Just before he died.

694
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:24,123
All right, he lied.
But let"s assume
it"s true.

695
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,628
Then someday
we"ll find him.
Maybe he"ll find you first.

696
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:29,688
What do you mean?
He plans to destroy
this fort.

697
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,030
Good. We"ll be
waiting for him.

698
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,502
Just remember
where you heard it first.

699
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,972
About these supplies:
You"ve got more
than you need.

700
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,236
l"m not authorized
to issue them to you.

701
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,279
Wars are won by initiative,
not authorization.

702
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,746
I never cared much
for debates, Major,

703
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,978
especially
with junior officers.

704
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:52,954
All right, Meade,
fight your own private war.

705
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:56,322
But before you"re through,
you"ll need more
than those eagles.

706
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,418
<i>Brady!</i>
<i>Brady, they've gone!</i>

707
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,555
Maygro?
And all the men.
They just rode out.

708
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:06,227
You must get them back.
What for? To save your
precious Capt. Corwin?

709
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:11,263
There are other things
to consider: the women
and children in this fort.

710
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,434
l"ve never seen
my father so angry.

711
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,944
Why didn"t you go too?
I told my father
I would not go.

712
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:20,506
I told him we were
gonna be married.
Married?

713
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:25,520
I had to tell him something.
That"s just another promise
he"ll think l"ve broken.

714
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,522
l"ll tell him
the truth someday.
Thanks.

715
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,923
I stayed
because I want you
to go after them.

716
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,825
You need them,
but they need you more.

717
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,693
They"ve known
hunger before,

718
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:37,824
but this time
their hunger
will have a purpose.

719
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,496
Bring them back, Brady.

720
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,471
I wasn"t sure I liked you
the first time I saw you.

721
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,974
Now?

722
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,476
I can stand you.

723
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,844
Not enough to have you
give me away in marriage.

724
00:55:56,419 --> 00:56:01,823
Won"t help to catch up
with Maygro unless we"ve got
more than words to offer him.

725
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,485
Supplies from the
quartermaster warehouse?
Yeah.

726
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,861
Biggest wagonload
of everything you can find.
Findin"s gonna be easy.

727
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:13,869
Gettin" it out will be the job.
You can turn it down
if you want.

728
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,565
Well, l"ve had a pretty good
career in the army.

729
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,370
Not as good as yours, Luke,
but it wasn"t bad.

730
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:23,207
l"ll let you
wear my stripes
while we do it.

731
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,840
I always knowed
l"d get to wear
them stripes someday.

732
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,682
Use the back gate.
Be sure to watch out
for the O.D.

733
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,437
How much time
we got left, Luke?

734
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:01,951
Two more minutes before
the officer of the day
will be making his rounds.

735
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:05,146
Maybe he"ll
be late tonight.
Capt. Neil is never late.

736
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:07,485
Capt. Neil!

737
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:11,493
We"ll never drink all that!
Two of"em
is for the horses.

738
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:15,657
He"ll be here any second!
I never drink
without a chaser.

739
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,565
Oh-oh.

740
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,707
Firin" squad,
here we come.

741
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,369
Start thinkin"
what you"re gonna say
at the court-martial.

742
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,615
Anybody in there?
No, sir.

743
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,513
We go on.

744
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:16,252
Just a few more
minutes, Maygro.
We wait too long now.

745
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,359
<i>[Wagon Approaches]</i>

746
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,680
Good work!
Did you have
any trouble?

747
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:49,748
Trouble? Ha! Aw, no,
we didn"t have no trouble,
Major. We was just...

748
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:03,331
By the orders of Col. Meade,
you"re under arrest.

749
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:06,967
Any move to resist
would save a tiresome
court-martial.

750
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,979
Don"t get drunk with power.
I still outrank you.
Temporarily.

751
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,982
What"s the charge?
What do you think?

752
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,985
Somebody made the mistake
of dropping his pay book.

753
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,454
The major didn"t have
nothin" to do with that.

754
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,990
This room is off-limits
to prisoners.

755
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,464
So we took
a few supplies.

756
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:35,334
You can do anything
you want with your men
and supplies, but not mine.

757
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,067
The secretary of war
can"t protect you now.

758
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,075
The supplies
will be replaced.

759
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,909
In the meantime,
they must be officially
listed as stolen.

760
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,676
Meade,
this isn"t West Roint:
it"s Indian country.

761
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,683
No regulations
ever stopped an Indian.

762
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,844
My first duty
is to this command.

763
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,889
What good were they
doing sitting here?
That"s my concern.

764
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:57,688
The concern
of every dead settler
from here to Arkansas.

765
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,754
You"ve been waitin" for me
to make a mistake like this.
<i>You're the type.</i>

766
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:06,529
Capt. Neil is waiting.
You"ll be under guard
in your quarters.

767
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,572
You plan to run
the Seminoles by yourself?
Yes.

768
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,698
l"m gonna run"em
out of this fort.

769
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,743
Even you can"t carry
petty jealousy that far.

770
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,746
Until the army replaces me,
l"m still commanding!

771
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,374
And using your rank
to make a personal war!

772
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,248
Out here
the U.S. Army is the law!

773
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:28,518
<i>I'm not gonna see it handed</i>
<i>over to a band of rabble!</i>
Even if they do the job better?

774
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,991
Even if they can
do the job better.

775
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,813
With them leaving
and Brady under guard,

776
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,509
that"s the last
of Brady"s bunch.

777
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:28,807
Good evening,
Mrs. Corwin.

778
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,217
Good evening.

779
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,094
We have only
a few moments before
we are discovered.

780
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,689
We need horses and guns.
They are going
out the back gate now.

781
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,997
How"d you get in?
Mrs. Corwin.

782
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,230
Let"s go.
You two stay here.

783
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,330
You can"t get rid of us.
We know too much.

784
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:29,071
l-It"d be desertion.
If we accomplish something,
they might be good to us, but...

785
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,512
It"s service
above and beyond
the call of duty.

786
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,016
All right, you enlisted.

787
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,454
You shouldn"t be here.
Get going!

788
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,456
l"m not leaving!
Don"t be crazy!

789
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,958
l"m staying here to prove
that you"ll all come back.

790
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:47,962
You don"t know what
they might do to you.
She made up her mind.

791
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,693
It"s the only thing
I can do to help.
All right.

792
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:13,322
There"s no doubt the Kiowas
are gathering to get ready
for the attack on the fort.

793
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:17,485
How many you think?
About every brave
who can ride a horse.

794
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,494
You can"t hide
that many Indians.

795
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:23,498
You can decoy your opposition
by sending out small parties
to strike at everything.

796
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:28,367
That"ll keep the colonel
running in every direction.
Would Corwin know to do this?

797
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,405
He"s a professional soldier,
isn"t he?

798
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:35,035
Then when Meade"s patrols
are out, he"ll hit the fort
with a big attack.

799
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:38,080
You told Meade
about this?
Yeah, I told him.

800
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,081
What is our job?

801
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:44,483
We"ll break up into
scouting parties to see
if Corwin uses this plan.

802
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:47,489
Let the raiding parties
go out, then trail "em
to the main force.

803
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,991
That way we"ll know
where it is.

804
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:54,519
Remember, if any of us
are seen or heard,
the fat"s in the fire.

805
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,588
Let"s go.

806
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:21,686
Who"s gonna play
hide-and-go-seek this time?
l"ll take this bunch.

807
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:29,024
All here.
We move fast,
Satanta.

808
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:32,527
Make sure horse
do not stumble.
Kiowas ride over you.

809
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,530
That"s the spirit.
When the attack starts,

810
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,533
we keep going until
everyone inside the fort
is killed.

811
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,537
My tribe take big chance.
It"s no chance:
it"s a certainty.

812
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,630
You make mistake,
you make no more.

813
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:48,302
Stop worrying. just start
counting the loot.

814
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,777
Well, I saw it.
How"d it look?

815
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:26,781
Biggest war party
in local history headin"
in this direction.

816
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:30,114
Them Kiowas sure
been breedin" fast.
Was Corwin with them?

817
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,053
It"s Corwin.
I got a glimpse
of Satanta too.

818
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:36,387
That fella with all
them sergeants" stripes
on his tepee?

819
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,986
Better warn Meade.
Listen, Meade would rather
have you in irons...

820
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:43,589
than beat the Kiowas.
He"ll have his chance
to do both. Mount up.

821
01:06:57,546 --> 01:07:00,481
<i>Back to give yourself up?</i>
Where are all the men?

822
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,710
Out on patrol.

823
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,816
How soon will
those patrols return?
They just went out.

824
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,330
What difference does it make?
Drop your sidearms
on the foor.

825
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:19,425
How many men are here?
He said drop your sidearm.
You"re under arrest.

826
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,665
Twenty? Forty?
Fifty?
Twenty.

827
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:26,003
Think you can put my whole
detachment under arrest?
Just you.

828
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,669
You"ll need even me.
In a half hour,
every Kiowa...

829
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:31,838
in this territory"s gonna
be climbing these walls.
I don"t believe that.

830
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:35,213
You oughta have
more faith, Colonel.
Rut it on the table.

831
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:39,220
You"re adding one charge
after another! l"ll see you
in front of a firing squad!

832
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,688
You won"t live
to see anything
if we don"t get moving.

833
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,691
Rile up
all your ammunition.

834
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,750
Set your artillery up
on the north wall.

835
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,797
Rut your women

836

- By that time, the Kiowas
will be finishing your meal!

837
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,172
You lost your rank
when you deserted!
That"s
for a court-martial to decide!

838

01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,856

you could find?
That"s all, sir.

846
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,327
We"ll need 20 times that.
Not with these old pieces.

847
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,329
Six rounds
and they"ll blow up.

848
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:59,333
What good is artillery here?
What good"s a fort with a hill
lookin" down its throat?

849
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:03,895
Nobody will be able
to move inside this compound.
You"re overdramatizing things.

850
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,941
Aw, there"s one
in every fort.

851

Inside, ladies.
That"s it.

Brady, it can"t be
this bad.

855
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:38,002
Your husband and every
Kiowa in this territory
are dropping in on us.

856
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,098
That"s right,
spread it out.

01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,975

I want to see him
for myself.

859
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,710
You"ll be tortured
if you"re caught.
He wouldn"t let them.

860
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:52,242
Once those Kiowas get inside,
nothing will stop them.
Where"s Avis?

861
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,256
She"s in

held as a prisoner.

862
