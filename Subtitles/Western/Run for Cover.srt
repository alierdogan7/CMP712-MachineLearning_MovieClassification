MALE CHORUS:
* Run for cover
Run for cover, I-ay *

2
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:32,433
* Head for the hills
Hit the trail *

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,067
* When trouble's on the run *

4
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,933
* Run for cover *

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,567
* Don't find yourself
Locked in jail *

6
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:42,200
* For something
You ain't done *

7
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:45,733
* Run for cover
Run for cover *

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,133
* Run for cover
I-ay *

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,900
* If your love has been blessed
With an angel face *

10
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:56,400
* But the devil
Has roped her soul *

11
00:00:56,467 --> 00:01:00,367
* Better ride for the plains
And the open space *

12
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:04,067
* And forget every kiss
You stole *

13
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,900
* Run for cover *

14
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:11,900
* Run for cover
I-ay, I-ay *

15
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:17,100
* Men who are slow on the draw
When bullets start to fly *

16
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,100
* Run for cover *

17
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:24,267
* Men who have broken the law
But still don't wanna die *

18
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:28,067
* Run for cover
Run for cover *

19
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,333
* Run for cover, I-ay *

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,100
* Though a man thinks he's born
With a hero's heart *

21
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:38,700
* He's afraid
When he's on his own *

22
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:42,167
* Just a fool takes a chance
In a hero's part *

23
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,833
* When he's facing
The odds alone *

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,800
* You must run for your life
Like the wind *

25
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,167
* To live another day *

26
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,167
* Run for cover *

27
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,067
* Run for cover *

28
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,233
* Run for cover *

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,633
* Run for cover **

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,933
(Horse nickers)

31
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,467
Take it easy, mister.

32
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,067
You want to announce yourself

33
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,733
When you come up
behind somebody.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,567
Didn't know there was anybody
in here.

35
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,200
You see my tracks?

36
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,467
Wasn't looking for any.
Just came to water my horse.

37
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,633
Go ahead.

38
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,067
I know most of the people
around here,

39
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,433
And they're friendly.

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,733
So am I.
But I don't like surprises.

41
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,533
You might have shot me
for doing nothing at all.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Sorry.

43
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:01,900
Wouldn't have done you
much good to be sorry

44
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:04,100
If you'd plugged me.

45
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,233
How old are you?

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,733
20.

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,233
Well, let's put it this way.

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,467
You stand a whole lot
better chance

49
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,533
Of being able to vote someday

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,567
Now that you've learned
not to sneak up on people.

51
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,267
I can take care of myself.

52
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,633
I don't need no lessons
from you or anybody else.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,533
All right.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,667
All right what?

55
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,300
You're not sore
because I pointed a gun at you.

56
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,100
You're sore
because you got scared.

57
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,467
Anybody who don't get scared

58
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,900
Looking down the wrong end of
a gun barrel ain't very bright.

59
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,267
But if you wanna feel
like Billy the Kid

60
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,200
And get tough about it,
go ahead.

61
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,767
That is, unless you happen
to be Billy the Kid.

62
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,367
In which case,
I withdraw my offer.

63
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,467
No, I ain't Billy the Kid.

64
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,767
I didn't think you were.

65
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,300
We wouldn't be
standing here talking.

66
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,533
My name's Dow.
Matthew Dow.

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,267
Davey Bishop.

68
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,133
Glad to know you, Davey.

69
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,467
I guess I was acting
like a kid at that.

70
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,533
Don't know when you got
a better right.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,433
20, huh?
Yes, sir.

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,633
Where you headed?

73
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,900
Madison,
just over the pass.

74
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,233
We can ride together.
You going there?

75
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,467
Going that way.

76
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,800
Not much doing there.
Good.

77
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,733
You know somebody
in Madison?

78
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,767
No.

79
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,067
Can't figure
why'd anybody

80
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,433
Wanna go to
a dead place like that

81
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,100
Unless they had to.

82
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,933
You have to?

83
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,200
I live there.

84
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:39,800
What do you do
for a living?

85
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,467
Most anything
that comes up.

86
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,800
Odd jobs, mostly.

87
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,400
Look like you'd make
a good ranch hand.

88
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:48,600
$20 a month and keep?
No, thanks.

89
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,800
Been around much?
Some.

90
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,833
That's for me. I'm gonna
light outta here pretty soon.

91
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,833
See what's going on
in the rest of the world.

92
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,200
Lookin' for excitement, huh?
Sure, why not?

93
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:08,133
No reason. Felt the same way
myself when I was your age.

94
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,900
(Train whistle blows)

95
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,767
Just about makes it
every time.

96
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,967
Got held up last month.

97
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,533
Right along here
when she was barely moving.

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,167
Lost all the payroll money.

99
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,400
Thought you said nothing ever
happened around here.

100
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,867
That sure lit the fuse.

101
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,567
Had posses out
all over the place.

102
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:25,067
Never did find 'em.

103
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,167
You ask me, the sheriff
wasn't too anxious to.

104
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,900
Talk was, it might have been
the Gentry gang.

105
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,067
There's two fellas up ahead,
right at that same spot.

106
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,667
We can handle
two of 'em.

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,400
If they're holdup men,
they won't be alone.

108
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,067
There'll be plenty of others
hiding around the brush

109
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,767
Where they can
throw down on us.

110
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,133
I only see two.

111
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,333
DAVEY:
That hawk's been
following me all day.

112
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,567
In case you thought
I didn't draw on you

113
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05.167
'Cause I couldn't
handle a gun...

114
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:06,567
(Gunshot)

115
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,333
(Gunshot)

116
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,667
That's the signal. That's what
they did the last time.

117
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:17,067
Sometimes it don't matter
so much how fast you are.

118
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,067
It's where you put
the first bullet that counts.

119
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,700
Put that gun down,
or they'll kill us.

120
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,067
I got a wife and family.

121
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:26,800
I don't wanna get killed
for somebody else's money,

122
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:29,167
No matter how much it is.

123
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,667
Holy smokes.

124
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,067
How do you like that?
They thought we were bandits.

125
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,700
(Train whistle blows)

126
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,367
How far is it to town?

127
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,067
'Bout ten miles.

128
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,633
We'd better get there quick.

129
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,933
Awful lotta money
to have dumped into your lap.

130
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,700
Man wouldn't have to work
the rest of his life.

131
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,533
Here.

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,100
Let's get going.

133
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,067
You carry it.
I'll follow you.

134
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,300
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

135
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,900
Like you said,
that's an awful lot of money.

136
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,467
Since you brought it up,
how do I know

137
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,900
You won't plug me in the back
and make off with it yourself?

138
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,667
One of us
has to take that chance.

139
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,433
What are you trying...
Where's the sheriff?

140
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,700
Over in his office, I guess.
Why?
We got held up.

141
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,833
Hey, Scottie!

142
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,233
The whole gang
woulda jumped us.

143
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,933
There wasn't anything else
we could do.

144
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:45,300
Round up some horses.
What happened?

145
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,567
Somebody held up
the train again.
Anybody hurt?

146
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,100
No, we didn't
give 'em a chance this time.

147
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,667
Soon as we seen they had us,
we... well, we threw out the money

148
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,667
And told Sam
to pour on the coal.

149
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,067
How many of them
was there?

150
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:58,700
We couldn't tell
for sure.

151
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,133
When the first two
fired on us,

152
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,133
I knocked Larry back
out of the way.

153
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,767
Did you get
a good look at 'em?

154
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,267
One of 'em
was riding a pinto.

155
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,333
I didn't stare
too hard.

156
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,700
Last time,
they give me this

157
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,833
Just for being a little slow
getting my hands up.

158
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,233
Let's grab a rifle, boys!

159
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,467
We gonna ride around
in circles again,

160
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,833
Like we did last time?

161
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,800
No, we ain't. They had
a bigger start before.

162
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,233
This time's
gonna be different.

163
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,867
Better be.

164
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:37,200
(Shouts)

165
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:24,967
There they are, boys.

166
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,367
Where's the rest
of 'em?

167
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,400
Maybe they split up.

168
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,067
Why would they
be riding toward town?

169
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,667
I don't know
what tricks they're up to,

170
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,400
But one of 'em's
riding on a pinto.

171
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,567
Looks like that one
in front's

172
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,233
Got a money bag
tied to his saddle.

173
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,933
Yes, sir.
That's them, all right.

174
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:49,433
Pass the word. Don't fire
until I give the signal.

175
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,567
I don't wanna scare 'em off
before they get into range.

176
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,700
Ain't you gonna give 'em
a chance to give up?

177
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:56,033
They're gonna get
the same chance

178
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,367
The train crew got
last time.

179
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,433
Hey, son! Son!

180
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,400
(Gunshots)

181
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:31,667
This one's
still alive.

182
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,500
Grab him, boys!
Here's his gun.

183
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,833
Drag him up.

184
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,500
I told you we'd get 'em
this time.

185
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,533
Wait, you got us wrong.

186
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,167
Here's the money!

187
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,100
We were bringing it
to town.

188
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,767
The messenger threw it
off the train.

189
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,900
He threw it off, all right.
After you took a shot at him.

190
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,933
Why would we be bringing
the money into town

191
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,533
If we were holdup men?

192
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,467
You probably got a hideout
around here, that's why.

193
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,233
Get him up to that tree!
Come on!

194
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,200
What kind of a sheriff
are you?

195
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,833
Hanging a man
without a trial?

196
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,767
We got you and the money.
That's good enough for me.

197
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,700
Come on!
Wait a minute!

198
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,900
The other one
is Davey Bishop.

199
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,700
Davey Bishop?
Aye.

200
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,333
Is he dead?
No, he's still breathing,
but that's about all.

201
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,167
He's in pretty bad shape.

202
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,267
Well, uh... well...

203
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,867
Take him over
to Swenson's place.

204
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,800
We'll send a doc out
from town.

205
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,300
Aye.

206
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:45,267
I'll ride ahead
and get him.

207
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:50,333
All right, come on!
Get him into town!

208
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,933
All right, boys.

209
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,833
Now get ahold of
them baggage men.

210
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,067
They're waitin' inside.
Good.

211
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,367
SHERIFF:
Now we'll find out
whose story holds water.

212
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,067
DOW:
I'm just as anxious
as you are.

213
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,367
That's him.
That's one of 'em.

214
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,267
What did you tell
these people?

215
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,633
Let me hear
what you said to them.

216
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,067
Well, I told them
what happened.

217
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,733
All right,
let's hear it again.

218
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,167
Just exactly
what did happen?

219
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,633
Go on.

220
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,500
Like I said, we were
right near the top of the grade,

221
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,500
Where we got held up before,
and we heard these shots.

222
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,433
Two shots.
Did they come at you?

223
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,900
We figured
that was a signal.

224
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,233
What made you
figure that?

225
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Last time...
Never mind about last time.

226
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,167
Did we make
any move at you?

227
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:18,167
I wasn't taking no chances.

228
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:25,067
Tell the truth!
Did we or didn't we?

229
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,933
Maybe...

230
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,100
Maybe we did
act a little hasty.

231
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,067
You sure did.

232
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,867
Then you made up
a great big story about it.

233
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,167
And then these butchers
did the rest.

234
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,967
Now, just a minute,
mister.

235
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,367
Where'd they take the kid?

236
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,333
Swenson's farm.
Couple miles south of town.

237
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,867
You ain't told us what you was
doin' here to begin with.

238
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:46,900
I was comin' in
to look your town over

239
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,133
To see if it was the kinda place
I'd wanna live in.

240
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,767
Well, you sure answered
that question.

241
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,067
Here's your gun.

242
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,733
It'd be a good idea
if you wore yours that way.

243
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,967
Mister, we...

244
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,367
We owe you
an apology.

245
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,867
I'll tell the boy.

246
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,567
He'll be real touched.

247
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,467
Well, how was I to know
from what these two fellas...

248
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,233
We didn't ask you
to shoot nobody down

249
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,667
Without giving 'em
a chance.

250
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,067
You'd think I done it
all by myself.

251
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,700
You was there, too.
All of you.

252
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,067
You were wearin'
the badge.

253
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,367
(Rooster crows)

254
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,767
Yes?

255
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,767
Ma'am.

256
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,233
I'm looking
for Davey Bishop.

257
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,400
They said
they were gonna bring him here.

258
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,367
This is the Swenson place,
isn't it?

259
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,967
It is.

260
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,700
I... I was with him
when the law jumped him.

261
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,767
The sheriff just admitted
he made a mistake.

262
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:20,400
The boy's here,
isn't he?
Yeah.

263
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:23,267
The doctor's
just with him.

264
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,867
One moment, please.

265
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,733
Your name Swenson?

266
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,567
Ja.
Helga Swenson.

267
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,833
You will come in?

268
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,367
Thank you.

269
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:03,867
How is he?

270
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:05,400
You hurt, too?

271
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,067
Oh, it's nothing.
A crease.

272
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,067
What?

273
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,300
A crease.
Just the skin.

274
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,267
What about Davey?

275
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,600
He's in here.

276
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,133
That's all I can do
for him.

277
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,367
How is he?

278
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,733
Three bullet holes
and a leg all busted up.

279
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,333
Is he gonna make it?

280
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,867
I can't work miracles.

281
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,067
If he's still alive tomorrow,
I'll take a look at him.

282
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,367
What about his family?
They been told?

283
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,467
His parents died
years back.

284
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,733
He's been a ward of the town
since, you might say,

285
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Living with one family
or the other.

286
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,867
Too bad.
He was a nice kid.

287
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:46,433
Kinda wild,
but he'd got over it.

288
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,833
You talk
like he was dead already.

289
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,933
Mister, I can't
work miracles.

290
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:54,200
I know.
You said that.

291
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,300
Bye.

292
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:01,933
Father...
This is my father, mister...

293
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,567
Oh, Dow.
Matthew Dow.

294
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm pleased
to know you.

295
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,567
Say, do you mind if
I hang around here awhile,

296
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,833
Kinda look after him?

297
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,333
You're welcome to.

298
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,900
Thanks.

299
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,867
There's work to do.
Farms do not run themselves.

300
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,067
In a minute, father.

301
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:19,367
In the old country,

302
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,933
Children do not say
"In a minute"

303
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,200
When the father speaks.

304
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:25,600
That's why I like America.

305
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,233
Sit down.
I'll fix your head.

306
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,233
That's all right.
Yes, I know.

307
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,300
It's just a crease?

308
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:44,367
Never mind with any of that.
Just a little water will do.

309
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,067
You sit here.

310
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,700
How did this happen,

311
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,700
That they shoot at you
and the other?

312
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,433
'Cause you got
a sheriff in this town

313
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,800
Who ought to be
behind a butcher's counter.

314
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,067
I don't understand if
you've done nothing wrong.

315
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:03,067
He didn't wait to find out.
They just blasted away.

316
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,067
You lucky they didn't hurt you
more badly, too.

317
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,133
I'd made the boy
ride up in front.

318
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:14,200
And, eh, you feel
sort of responsible?

319
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:17,067
That's part of it.
Thank you.

320
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,900
Perhaps there's more?

321
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:28,500
Yes, there's more.

322
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,100
My boy had lived to be
just about his age.

323
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,700
This doesn't look good.

324
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,067
Kid's gonna die,
he should be able to wake up

325
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:39,067
And see a friendly face.

326
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:42,433
Have somebody around
when he wakes up scared.

327
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:54,300
If you need anything,
I'm in here.

328
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,800
Thanks.

329
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,300
Here's your breakfast.

330
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:41,533
He's burning up.

331
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,333
Where's that doctor?
He said he'd be here today.

332
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,300
It's only 7:00.

333
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,433
Listen, you eat your breakfast
before it gets cold.

334
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,667
I'll do this.

335
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,200
You've been very nice.

336
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:07,800
And thanks
for this, too.

337
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,567
You eat now.

338
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:24,833
The doc says Davey's
coming along fine.

339
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,567
He'll make it.

340
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,700
We're getting up a kitty
to pay the doc.

341
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,133
The boys was wonderin' if there
was anything else they could do.

342
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,233
Have they got
any books in town?

343
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,133
Books?

344
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,733
I guess
I could round some up.

345
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,233
But I never figured Davey
for much of a reader.

346
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,367
Well, maybe he never had
so much time before.

347
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:53,433
Aye.
I'll see what I can do.

348
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,667
He ate everything.

349
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:07,133
Anybody who doesn't
like your cooking

350
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,467
Doesn't want to get well.

351
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:11,433
He's all right.
He went right back to sleep.

352
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,467
Well, then I'll... I'll
finish this.

353
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,167
You said the other night
that you had a son.

354
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:22,800
Died ten years ago.

355
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,700
Do you have a wife, too?

356
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,433
She divorced me.

357
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,767
She must have been bad.

358
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,067
No.
Just hated the sight of me.

359
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:37,800
That's hard to understand.

360
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,567
She did very well with it.

361
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:45,233
Does it hurt you
to talk about it?

362
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
Not anymore.

363
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,433
You mind
if I ask you something?

364
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,067
This is as far
as our ticket would take us.

365
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:58,067
Well, you were
going to ask that.

366
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,067
Weren't you?

367
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:03,567
What two Swedes are doing
in a place like this?

368
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,867
That's right.

369
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,267
We didn't know
we were coming here.

370
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,700
My father has an uncle
who lives in California,

371
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:12,600
And he used to write us
about his place.

372
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,133
So we decided
that's where we wanted to go,

373
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,067
But we didn't know
the country was so big.

374
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,867
So when we got this far
on the train,

375
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,200
We had no more money.

376
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,233
So here we are.

377
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,433
My father says that
when we make enough money,

378
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,867
We shall go to California
and buy land next to my uncle.

379
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:32,533
Only it's two years now, and
we still haven't made any money.

380
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,933
How's that?

381
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:38,900
Well, without help, we cannot
farm enough to make money.

382
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:42,400
And without money,
we cannot hire anyone to help.

383
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,067
Isn't there something
I can do around here

384
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,833
To kinda work off what
I owe you for all this?

385
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,133
You owe us nothing.

386
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,333
Sure I do.

387
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,933
I haven't got any money...
You are a guest.

388
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,600
Father would think
you had very bad manners

389
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:56,933
If he heard you
talk like that.

390
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,100
It is late.
Yes, father.

391
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,967
He doesn't think
very much of me.

392
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:09,233
It isn't you. It's our custom
he's thinking of.

393
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,067
What's the custom?

394
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,767
In Sweden, a girl is not
supposed to be alone with a man

395
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,667
Unless he's...

396
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,233
Well, unless they're...

397
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,367
It's a very silly
custom, anyhow.

398
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,233
Good night.

399
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,167
Good night.

400
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,933
Soon the boy will be
well enough to be moved.

401
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:42,100
He's still
very weak, father.

402
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:44,933
He's young.
He will get stronger.

403
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,067
Morning.
Good morning.

404
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:49,067
He's sleeping like a baby.

405
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,467
I wanna ask a favor,
Mr. Swenson.

406
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,100
Ja?

407
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,067
You've been very kind
to Davey and me,

408
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,133
And now that he
won't be needing somebody

409
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,967
To watch over him
every minute,

410
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,733
I was wondering if there isn't
something I can do around here

411
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,967
To kinda pass the time away.

412
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:11,600
A man gets logy
sitting around all day.

413
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,367
You're right.

414
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,733
It's not good for a man
to stay in the house.

415
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,233
A fella needs exercise.

416
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,167
Without it, the man
has no appetite.

417
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,467
Besides, Helga and you,

418
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,333
I would not let you do it
any other way.

419
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,433
I sure fooled him.

420
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,933
Whoa!

421
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,600
How 'bout it, doc?
When you gonna let me up?

422
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,967
Pretty soon now.

423
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,567
I feel great.
What more do you want?

424
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:13,467
Enjoy it while you can, son.

425
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:14,900
Couple of days behind a plow,

426
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,567
And you'll wish you were back
in a nice, soft bed.

427
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:18,733
When I get outta here,

428
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,167
It won't be to end up
behind a plow.

429
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:22,800
Best way in the world
to build up your strength.

430
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,533
Great for the legs.

431
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,700
May I see you a minute?

432
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:33,767
Well, how you doing
with the new batch?

433
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,067
Take a look.
What do they think I am?

434
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,733
"A Romance of Flowers... How
to Grow Them in Your Garden."

435
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,567
"A Young Girl's Dilemma...
Should She Marry for Money,

436
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,367
Or Listen to the Dictates
of Her Heart?"

437
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:48,067
I forgot to tell you,
these were sent over

438
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,333
With the compliments
of the ladies' sewing circle.

439
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,733
You'll probably get

440
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,100
"Five Little Peppers and
How They Grew in the Morning."

441
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,567
Matt...
What's the matter?

442
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:05,900
I just told her that,

443
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:08,067
That leg isn't going to be
any good to him.

444
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:09,433
You mean it's going to take
a little while.

445
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,267
It'll never be right.
How bad is it?

446
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:17,067
Might be able to get around some
after he gets stronger...
Get around some?

447
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,633
He's a kid,
not an old man.

448
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,200
What kind of a doctor are you?
Can't even fix a broken leg.

449
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,233
Not the way
that one was broken.

450
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,067
Why didn't you
say so before?

451
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,800
Why'd you lead him to believe
he was gonna get well?

452
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,600
I wasn't sure
till I took the splints off.

453
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,700
What makes you so sure now?
You were wrong once before.

454
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,867
Not this time.

455
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,933
It's a miracle
he lived at all.

456
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:45,200
Miracles don't come in pairs.

457
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,933
What does he know about it?

458
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,533
He's been ready
to call in the buzzards

459
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,067
Ever since he got here.

460
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,700
Think nobody ever had
a broken leg before.

461
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:00,767
(Glass breaking)

462
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,100
Matt!

463
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,767
My leg!
I can't walk!

464
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:09,600
Oh, you poor boy.

465
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,067
Get up.
I can't.

466
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,267
Get up!

467
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:16,133
Matt, leave him alone.

468
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,767
Get out.

469
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,867
Matt, you can't force him.

470
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,333
Matt!

471
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,300
Why didn't you let me die?
I'd rather be dead.

472
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:29,200
You're not dead.
So get up.

473
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,400
Grab hold of that.
Pull yourself up.

474
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,667
Leave me alone.

475
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,733
I'll leave you alone,
when you're on your feet.

476
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,300
Get up!

477
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,167
You heard me, get up!

478
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,933
There's nothing wrong
with your arms. Pull!

479
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,733
That's the last time
I wanna see you crawl.

480
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,067
What am I supposed to do,

481
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:07,333
Carry a chair around with me
the rest of my life?

482
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,600
Lots of fellas live and die
without ever having to find out

483
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,967
How much of a man they are.

484
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:13,367
You could be as good a man
as anybody in town.

485
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:16,833
If you are, you'll know it
and take pride in it.

486
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,633
And they'll know it, too.
You all through?

487
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,933
Then you get out.

488
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,700
Get away from me.

489
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,300
You and your big talk.

490
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,300
Get outta here
on your two good legs!

491
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,200
Get out!

492
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,067
You better go help him.

493
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:07,067
I heard what he said
to you.

494
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:10,367
He didn't mean it.

495
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,833
You were right,
and he was right.

496
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,267
I shouldn't
have bullied him.

497
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:19,367
You were only
trying to help.

498
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:21,267
I was a big help.

499
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,700
DAVEY:
Matt! Quick!

500
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,067
Watch.

501
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,767
How was that?

502
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,400
Fine, son.
Just fine.

503
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,000
Let's see you try
by yourself today.

504
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:57,667
Come on, cowboy.

505
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:19,933
How does it feel?

506
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:22,333
Don't ache as much.

507
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,500
Ever hear of a cowhand
walking when he could ride?

508
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:29,267
If you've got a horse
and a saddle, you'll get around.

509
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,567
Glad to see you
up and around, Davey.

510
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:52,567
We all know how you both feel
about what happened.

511
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,333
That's why we're here.

512
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,667
Yes, we realize this town
owes you a debt, Dave,

513
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,667
And as mayor, the folks want me
to do what we can to pay it off.

514
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:02,233
Now, we're not rich people,
Dave, you know that.

515
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,100
If we were, we'd make
a settlement on you.

516
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,767
We've talked it over
and decided

517
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,167
The next best thing to do
is to give you

518
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:10,533
The security of a good job
with good pay

519
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,500
As long as you want it.

520
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,400
I'm not asking
for any job.

521
00:32:17,467 --> 00:32:20,067
I'm not asking
for any more handouts.

522
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,400
You shot me up good,
but you didn't kill me.

523
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,767
So from now on, I think
I'll take care of myself.

524
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:27,200
We were just trying
to make it up to ya, Davey.

525
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:29,967
Give me back one good leg,
and we'll call it square.

526
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:33,567
That's the only settlement
I want from any of you.

527
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:41,933
MAYOR:
Maybe you can talk to him.
We know how the kid feels.

528
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:44,667
He's not a kid.
He's a man.

529
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:46,267
We've got something
to say to you, too,

530
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,467
If you'd hear us out.

531
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,233
Yes, we figure this town
could do with a new sheriff.

532
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,767
It'll pay $1,000 a year
and all fines.

533
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,333
That's a little high for
a slight scalp wound, isn't it?

534
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,900
This isn't charity.
We need a sheriff.

535
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:00,400
Why me? You don't know
anything about me.

536
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,633
You were the only one
that kept his head that day.

537
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,100
And we know what you've been
doing for Davey, too.

538
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,067
We've had enough gunslingers
wearing badges.

539
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,567
We figured it's about time
we had a man

540
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:12,567
With some character
in the job.

541
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,300
I'll take it
on one condition.

542
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,933
That I run the job
and name my own deputies.

543
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,467
I approve.

544
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:21,567
And you can put lynching down
as part of your past history

545
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:26,300
And turn all of your nervous
posse-men out to pasture.

546
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:29,767
Congratulations, sheriff.

547
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,633
Here's your badge.

548
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,233
And a little advance
on your salary.

549
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,633
We've got a room for you
in town, too.

550
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,733
I'll be in tonight.

551
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,733
So you're the new sheriff.

552
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,300
Yep.

553
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:19,600
What's that for?

554
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,400
A decent burial.

555
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,267
Where I come from,
all the peace officers

556
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,133
Carry around
their own burial money.

557
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,300
Custom of the country.
Suppose you need
that chamber?

558
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,433
I'm not that fast.

559
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,667
If I haven't hit
what I'm aiming at

560
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,467
By the time I squeeze off
the first five,

561
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,133
I'll be needing a pine box
instead of another bullet.

562
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,267
What did you take the job for
if you're not fast enough?

563
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,800
'Cause you'll be
my deputy.

564
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,200
Remember the time
you drew on that hawk

565
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,567
Down by the railroad tracks?

566
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:52,933
Yeah.

567
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,733
You hit it.

568
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,167
Oh, well, I can generally hit
what I'm shooting at.

569
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:00,433
But I'm not likely
to get in the first shot.

570
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,067
You beat me by,
oh, I would say,

571
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,933
A full three seconds.

572
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:06,133
Yeah, but you said...

573
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,467
Look, the way I figure it
is this.

574
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:09,800
It doesn't matter how slow I am.
You'll be with me.

575
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:17,200
Do you really think...

576
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:18,333
Oh, you don't think
I'd be fool enough

577
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,133
To take this job alone,
do you?

578
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,333
In fact, I am pretty fast.
I used to practice a lot.

579
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,900
Well, start practicing
some more,

580
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:28.300
'Cause we're in business.

581
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,833
Take care of the horse,
deputy.

582
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,467
I heard
you and the men outside.

583
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,200
Too bad
this had to come up,

584
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:59,633
Just when I was getting the hang
of being a dirt farmer.

585
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,233
Perhaps you didn't like it.

586
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,667
I didn't think I would.

587
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:06,500
At first I was doing it
just to pay my keep.

588
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,500
Then I got kind of
interested in it.

589
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:11,633
Working the land and getting
something useful out of it.

590
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,367
Most peace I've had
in a long time.

591
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,200
If you feel that way
about it, why...

592
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,800
Too good an offer
to pass up.

593
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,633
Besides, I couldn't go on
living here.

594
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,433
Not with Davey
up and around.

595
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,267
What's going
to become of him?

596
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,600
He's going to be my deputy.

597
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,533
So that's why
you're doing it.

598
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,633
$1,000 a year and fines?
That's reason enough.

599
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,200
And Davey?

600
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:39,900
He's fast with a gun.
I can use him.

601
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,900
You're a very bad liar.

602
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:47,267
You're kinda tough
to lie to.

603
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,167
Let's keep it
in the family, huh?

604
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:52,233
Don't live his life
for him, Matt.

605
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,067
Not even if he were
your own son.

606
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:56,067
I'm not trying to.

607
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,867
All I wanna do
is give him a chance.

608
00:36:57,933 --> 00:37:00,400
Make him feel like he's doing
a man's job.

609
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,133
You think putting a gun
in his hand

610
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,867
Will cure
what is in his heart?

611
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,567
What do you mean?

612
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:16,067
The way he talked to them
when they came out here.

613
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,733
I was watching him.

614
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,367
It wasn't just
the anger of the words.

615
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:26,167
There was a look
in his eyes.

616
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:28,600
It frightened me.

617
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:31,867
I've never seen a man
look like that before.

618
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:34,300
I have.

619
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:36,067
Did he get over it?

620
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:38,367
Took him a long time.

621
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,300
There was nobody around
to help him.

622
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:44,967
Maybe it's better that way,
to do it on your own.

623
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,133
Davey's too young.

624
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,133
I can't cut him loose.
He'd never make it.

625
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,233
He's gotta get over it,
or it's gonna get worse.

626
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,800
It's gonna go
one way or the other.

627
00:37:51,867 --> 00:37:53,400
That's where old Dr. Dow
comes in.

628
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:54,533
Give him something to do

629
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,067
Before he gets
feeling sorry for himself.

630
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,667
Make him feel
he's still a man.

631
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,433
That's what he needs.

632
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,933
You're awfully sure,
aren't you?

633
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,233
I'll tell father
you're leaving.

634
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,467
Oh, I, uh...

635
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:16,933
I wanted to say good-bye
to you first.

636
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,700
Now, is there anything
in the Swedish rules

637
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:21,067
That says
I can't see you in town?

638
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,133
We go in only on Sundays
to go to church.

639
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,233
That's what this town needs,
a church-going sheriff.

640
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,433
Speaking of customs,
we have one here in America.

641
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,333
When a man and woman
like each other,

642
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,100
And they're not gonna see
each other for a while...

643
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,900
Except in church, or with
a lot of people around, they...

644
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:52,700
We have that custom
in Sweden, too.

645
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:07,367
I should have taken
one of those store jobs

646
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:08,733
For all the action
there is around here.

647
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,467
Good afternoon, Matt, Dave.

648
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:11,767
Mr. Mayor.

649
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:14,467
Two drunks and one fight
in all this time.

650
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,633
Well...

651
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,800
The quieter it is,
the better I like it.

652
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:23,067
I don't see
where you need me

653
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:26,233
To help you handle
stuff like that.

654
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,067
Sometimes a deputy
doesn't earn his pay

655
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,933
For months on end.

656
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,067
Comes trouble...
(Chuckles)

657
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,567
You get caught up
quick and fast.

658
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,333
About the length of time
it takes somebody

659
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,700
To empty a gun at you.

660
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,167
Howdy.

661
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:56,833
How 'bout change for these,
Blazer?

662
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,500
Yes, sir.
How do you want it?

663
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,100
Fives and tens
will do.

664
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,133
Sure enough, mister.

665
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:13,467
Pretty good, huh?

666
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,233
That reminds me.

667
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,233
Something I been meaning
to tell you.

668
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,633
Remember when they threw
that money off the train at us?

669
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,467
Most money I've seen
before or since.

670
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:30,100
Me, too.

671
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,567
Matter of fact,
for a minute there,

672
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:33,367
When you were picking it up,

673
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:37,767
I came awful close
to wanting it all for myself.

674
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:41,500
Darn near drew on you.
Yeah?

675
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,067
Why didn't you?

676
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:44,600
Just about then you tossed
the money up at me.

677
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,333
That kinda broke it up.

678
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,100
Pretty lucky throw,
wasn't it?
Yeah.

679
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,900
Why you grinnin'
like that?

680
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:58,433
Did you know
all the time?

681
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,633
Yes, sir.
Mighty good job.

682
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,800
The quieter it is,
the better I like it.

683
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:07,333
Pete!

684
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:10,667
Come here, son.

685
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:15,067
For you.

686
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,133
Think you can handle it?
Yeah.

687
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,467
I'll have to get
some more cash.

688
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:28,733
What's wrong
with that?

689
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,533
There isn't enough.
Just give me what you have.

690
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,667
I'm in a hurry.

691
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,100
(Gunshots)

692
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,367
Take care of him.

693
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:58,167
Somebody get the doctor.

694
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:54,300
(Gunshot)

695
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:07,367
All right.

696
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:11,067
Get up.
Get up.

697
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:13,667
We didn't steal nothin'.

698
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:15,467
We just come in
to change some bills.

699
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:17,200
A fella
pulled a gun on us.

700
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:19,100
Man's got a right
to defend himself.

701
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,067
We'll find out about that
when we get back in town.

702
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:24,900
Well, you draw pretty good.

703
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,067
Too bad nobody's
gonna see it.

704
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:29,633
Something else
in there, friend.

705
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,133
$500 that says
you lost my trail.

706
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:36,433
Another hour, I'd have
made it anyway.

707
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,200
Nobody'll know
the difference.

708
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:43,733
Nobody but me.

709
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,700
That's a lotta money
to turn down, friend.

710
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,467
Turn around.

711
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:59,133
Get mounted.

712
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:04,367
Will Andrews and me
be safe in your town?

713
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,267
You'll go to trial.

714
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:11,800
(Piano music,
people talking)

715
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,300
What are they celebratin'?

716
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,900
I don't know.

717
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,467
Andrews!

718
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,267
This your idea
of a trial?

719
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:45,767
What's gonna happen
to me?

720
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:48,833
You'll get a trial,
just like I said.

721
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,233
I tried, Matt.
Honest I did.

722
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,300
I'm sure you did.

723
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,633
Let me see your gun.

724
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,867
I had it out.

725
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:14,133
I told them I'd shoot
the first man

726
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,600
That came through the door.

727
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,733
They were drunk.

728
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,967
They didn't pay
any attention to me.

729
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:24,067
Just kept coming
and I was backing up,

730
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:27,367
When all of a sudden...

731
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,100
My leg gave out on me.

732
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:30,767
There was nothing
I could do.

733
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,767
You still had this.

734
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,867
I couldn't just
shoot into a crowd.

735
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:37,267
Crowds don't lynch people.
That was a mob.

736
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,633
You oughtta know the difference.

737
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,333
Yeah, but this man
was an outlaw.

738
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,833
Wasn't your job
to judge him.

739
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,200
We have courts and juries
for that.

740
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:48,933
What did you want me to do,
be a hero? Shoot somebody?

741
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:50,567
Maybe get shot myself?

742
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:52,300
That was the job, son.

743
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,200
I don't want it, then.

744
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,133
I don't want
any part of it.

745
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:15,667
What about me?

746
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:17,200
What happens
when that crazy bunch of drunks

747
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:20,367
Finds out I'm here?

748
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,067
You won't be here.

749
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:23,400
By the time they get tired
of telling each other

750
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:24,633
How brave they are,

751
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,067
You'll be halfway
to the county seat.

752
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:29,933
I'll turn you over
to the marshal there.

753
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,467
Keep an eye on him.
I'll get some grub together.

754
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:51,933
How come they let a kid like you
be deputy?

755
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:54,933
Takes a man
to hold off a mob.
Shut up!

756
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:57,967
Don't take it out on me,
just 'cause you lost your nerve.

757
00:46:58,067 --> 00:47:00,200
I wasn't
afraid of 'em.

758
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,433
He thinks you were.

759
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,733
He thinks a lot of things.

760
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,933
My partner out there.
He get it quick?

761
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:11,200
I seen a fellow dangle once
for 20 minutes.

762
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,800
Flopped around
like a fish out of water.

763
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,167
I didn't watch.

764
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:17,267
I don't blame you.

765
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:20,067
Ain't a pretty sight.
No matter how they do it.

766
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,300
You.
We better get going.

767
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:35,900
Sorry I let you down
before.

768
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:39,600
Another chance?

769
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,467
Sure you want it?

770
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,733
He's your prisoner.
Get him there.

771
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,833
Thanks, Matt.

772
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,967
Don't thank me.
Get him there.

773
00:48:26,267 --> 00:48:28,767
(Music and carousing)

774
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,067
(Gunshot)

775
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:36,067
Guess we showed 'em how to treat
outlaws around here.

776
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:37,533
I believe in law and order.

777
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,967
But there's times you gotta
make exceptions.

778
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:41,767
Outlaws.
They're all alike.

779
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,100
They're big and tough

780
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:47,333
Until you slip a knot
around their neck.

781
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,267
(Gunshot)

782
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,533
You're all under arrest.

783
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,600
Look, sheriff,

784
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,367
I know you take
your job serious,

785
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,067
But you're not gonna
put me in no jail.

786
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:06,967
That's to cut him down with.
Pick it up.

787
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:23,567
Put your guns on the table.

788
00:49:23,633 --> 00:49:25,867
We didn't hire you
to pull stuff like this.

789
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:27,667
Tell it to the mayor.

790
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,800
I... I wasn't in on it.

791
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:51,800
Close up.

792
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:53,467
Yes, sir.

793
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,800
JUDGE:
I hereby sentence you
to be fined

794
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:59,233
The sum of $5.00 each
for malicious mischief

795
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,900
And another five
for disturbing the peace.

796
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:01,900
(Bangs gavel)

797
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:03,500
Court's adjourned.

798
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:13,633
No hard feelings, Matt.

799
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,733
Morning.

800
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,800
Sorry I gave you trouble
last night.

801
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:25,000
Next time I talk up to you,
just bust me over the head.

802
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,467
I'll keep that in mind.

803
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,167
Yeah, here you are, sheriff.

804
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:36,500
Pretty fair day's work.

805
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:38,667
That the established price
for lynching?

806
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:40,133
There ain't
no established price.

807
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,733
No one's ever got arrested
for a thing like that before.

808
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,967
You think I let him off
pretty easy, don't ya?

809
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:50,733
Well, I wouldn't exactly say
you made an example of him.

810
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,033
Law and order's an awful lot
like hard liquor.

811
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,333
Too big a dose the first time

812
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,067
Is liable to put a man
off of it for life.

813
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:58,767
He gotta get
used to it, gradual.

814
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,833
Maybe that isn't what it says
in Blackstone,

815
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,300
But he didn't
live out west.

816
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,800
Maybe you got a point.

817
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:08,333
This still belongs to you.

818
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,633
You can do an awful lot
with $70.

819
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,167
You do it.

820
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:18,967
Where's the sheriff?

821
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:20,067
Judge is giving him
a lecture.

822
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,800
He's sure getting an earful!

823
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:24,233
Get over to Doc Ridgeway's.
They just brought Davey in.

824
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,633
What happened to him?
I don't know.

825
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,900
Somebody found him on the trail,
a couple of miles out.

826
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:30,333
Hurt bad?
Leg again.

827
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,667
(Door closes)

828
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,867
Gives me a perfect record.

829
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:46,933
You handed two men over to me,

830
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:49,200
And I couldn't hold
either of them.

831
00:51:49,267 --> 00:51:52,133
How'd it happen?

832
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,100
We were crossing a stream.

833
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:57,900
Gotten off to fill my canteen,
and he asked for a drink.

834
00:51:57,967 --> 00:51:59,067
When I gave it to him,

835
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,967
He brought he handcuffs
down on my head.

836
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:03,500
I saw it coming, but
I couldn't get out of the way.

837
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:05,267
You shouldn't have
let me do it.

838
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,233
Just trying to show you
I wasn't yellow.

839
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,233
I never thought you were.

840
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,467
That whole job is a phony.

841
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:13,733
I'm no deputy and never was.

842
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,267
Good for wrapping packages
behind a counter,

843
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:17,367
And that's all.

844
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:18,967
We'll talk about that later.

845
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:20,933
Nothing to talk about.

846
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:22,467
I'm through trying
to fool myself.

847
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:25,233
Can't let you go on
doing it, either.

848
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,233
If that job's still open,
I'm gonna take it.

849
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,700
I've given him some pills.

850
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:32,667
If you two will quit gabbing,
he oughta get some rest.

851
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,467
He's right.
Get some rest.

852
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:37,267
Wearing a star ain't all
it's cracked up to be, anyway.

853
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,633
Oh, yes.
Papa is just fine.

854
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,367
Here he comes.
Dave isn't with him?

855
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:03,267
It'll take the doc time
to do the stitching.

856
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,467
Matt, how is he?

857
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:07,233
He'll be all right.
Just a little knock on the head.

858
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,200
The other one got away?

859
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:12,433
Yeah.

860
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,833
I told you we shoulda
hung 'em both.

861
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:29,867
Old Doctor Dow,
sees all, knows all.

862
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:32,300
I certainly
fixed things up fine.

863
00:53:32,367 --> 00:53:34,067
It wasn't your fault.

864
00:53:34,067 --> 00:53:35,767
Nobody else's.

865
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:36,900
I thought it was like
the first time

866
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,367
You get thrown from a bronc.

867
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:39,867
You gotta get right up
on his back again

868
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:41,767
Or the chances are,
you never will.

869
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,767
Didn't work out that way.

870
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,067
You were right all along.

871
00:53:46,067 --> 00:53:49,533
You can't live
somebody's life for them.

872
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,600
Maybe you feel free
now to...

873
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,867
Well, to start living
your own life now.

874
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:58,433
Maybe it's about time I did.

875
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,933
As a matter of fact,
I've been thinking

876
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:04,300
This'd be a pretty good town
to live in for a long time.

877
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:06,400
Why...

878
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:09,433
I thought you were staying
only because of Davey.

879
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,567
I was at first.

880
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:16,333
And then I got to figuring that
with $1,000 a year and fines

881
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,067
A man could do all right
for himself.

882
00:54:26,067 --> 00:54:29,300
Well, I-I'd better
be going now.

883
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:32,767
I have some shopping to do.

884
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:37,500
I know I shouldn't even
be thinking this.

885
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,867
And this is certainly
not the time or the place

886
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:41,867
To talk about it.

887
00:54:41,933 --> 00:54:42,933
There should be moonlight,

888
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:45,633
And I should be able
to say it a lot better...

889
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,433
I'd like very much
to marry you.

890
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,200
I'm not very good at...

891
00:54:54,233 --> 00:54:58,867
Well, if that's what you were
going to ask me.

892
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:03,133
That's what I was
gonna ask you.

893
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,467
You better speak
to my father.

894
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:08,067
He's very old-fashioned
about those things.

895
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,567
Bring him on.

896
00:55:12,633 --> 00:55:14,467
Be patient with him.

897
00:55:14,533 --> 00:55:17,900
He's not used to the ways
of this country.

898
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,533
We'll get along.

899
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:47,200
What is the matter with you?

900
00:55:47,267 --> 00:55:50,600
There's only one move
to make.

901
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:52,600
Oh, excuse me.

902
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:55,367
Nay, that is not it.

903
00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:57,633
Oh, excuse me.

904
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,633
(Knock on door)

905
00:56:03,433 --> 00:56:04,633
(Sighs)

906
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:13,367
Come in, Matthew.

907
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:26,567
Mr. Swenson.
Hello, Matt.

908
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,467
It is good you are here.
Sit down.

909
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:33,533
Papa, Matthew didn't
come here to play chess.

910
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,533
Matthew can talk
for himself.

911
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,500
Well, I...

912
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:40,600
This is fine.
Fine.

913
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,900
Mr. Swenson...
It is my move.

914
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:51,233
(Speaking Swedish)

915
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,633
It is more rude
to correct one's elders.

916
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:08,333
It is your move.

917
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:23,633
Uhh.

918
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,867
Well, I should go in the kitchen
and make some coffee.

919
00:57:47,933 --> 00:57:49,600
Hmm.

920
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,500
(Pots clattering)
Oh!

921
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:16,300
Ja da.

922
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,500
Checkmate.

923
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:24,700
Well, you're just
too good for me.

924
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,633
You're a smart man.

925
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:30,567
You know better than to win
before I give my consent.

926
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,900
Helga told you?

927
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,200
Ever since you leave,
she go round like lost heifer.

928
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:38,400
Then you come here,
all dressed up.

929
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:40,133
What is there to tell?

930
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,100
Well, how do you
feel about it?

931
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:45,600
You will be good to her.

932
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:49,433
She will be happy with you.

933
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,400
Besides, you two
had decided anyway.

934
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:53,933
When is it to be?

935
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:56,567
I've had my eye on a place
I'd like to buy into.

936
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,167
Nice house, plenty of land.

937
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:00,567
Only trouble is, they're
kinda short-handed.

938
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:02,633
I figured I might
save enough to swing it

939
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,133
In the next
couple of months.

940
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,367
That so?

941
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:14,633
Where is this place?

942
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,067
Right here.

943
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,367
That can be arranged.

944
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,767
Helga!

945
00:59:33,567 --> 00:59:35,267
It is late.

946
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:37,133
Say good night to your man.

947
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,233
Night, pa.

948
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,633
Good night.

949
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,533
I will be a very good wife,
I promise.

950
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,567
Whatever unhappiness
you've had before,

951
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,367
I will make it up to you.

952
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:06,700
You don't have to make up
for anything.

953
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:11,133
Just be you, that's all
I'll ever ask.

954
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:19,033
(Church bells ringing)

955
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:25,333
Happy Easter, you two.

956
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,633
Hmm, mighty pretty Easter, too.

957
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,900
The Martins brought me in.

958
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,133
My father had to mend
the harness.

959
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,600
He'll be along soon.
He said not to wait.

960
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:34,733
Davey, I haven't seen you
in a long time.

961
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,433
Workin' man.

962
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,167
Walsh is keeping him busy
at the store.

963
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:40,300
That's good.

964
01:00:40,367 --> 01:00:42,433
(Organ playing)

965
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:16,633
* Christ our lord
Is risen today *

966
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:21,633
* Alleluia *

967
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:27,267
* Sons of men
And angels sing *

968
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:32,067
* Alleluia *

969
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:37,633
* Lives again
Our glorious king *

970
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:42,767
* Alleluia *

971
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:48,367
* Where, O death,
Is now thy sting? *

972
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:53,967
* Alleluia *

973
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:58,600
* Dying once
He all doth save *

974
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:03,533
* Alleluia *

975
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:09,267
(Fewer people singing):
* Where thy victory, O grave? *

976
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:10,867
* Ah... **

977
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:13,067
(Music continues)

978
01:02:20,267 --> 01:02:21,733
(Music stops)

979
01:02:23,767 --> 01:02:28,833
Now, everybody sit down
nice like,

980
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,100
And nobody'll get hurt.

981
01:02:39,867 --> 01:02:42,367
How dare you profane
a house of worship?

982
01:02:42,433 --> 01:02:45,333
Bringing in guns.

983
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,067
Begging your pardon, parson.

984
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:50,600
We'll be out of here
in a few minutes.

985
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:53,133
What do you want with us?
Who runs the bank?

986
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:57,133
I do.

987
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:03,333
Some of my friends
are over there now.

988
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,133
They figure there's about
$80,000 in that vault.

989
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,767
That right?

990
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:12,600
You got a nice little
family there, banker.

991
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:15,133
I asked you a question.

992
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,400
Eight... Eighty-five thousand
in gold and in notes.

993
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:22,067
Notes negotiable?

994
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:23,133
Anywhere.

995
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,800
That's good.

996
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,233
Now where's your sheriff?

997
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,700
I got some suggestions
for him.

998
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:38,467
Matt Dow.

999
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:40,367
Hello, Gentry.

1000
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,833
I didn't know you was
in these parts.

1001
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,533
Woulda cut you in,
for old time's sake.

1002
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,867
I wouldn't have taken it.

1003
01:03:50,933 --> 01:03:52,933
You mean you're really
the sheriff?

1004
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:53,933
Mm-hmm.

1005
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:56,967
And in church.
Heh heh heh.

1006
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:58,467
This yours?

1007
01:03:58,533 --> 01:03:59,667
Yes.

1008
01:03:59,733 --> 01:04:00,900
(Crazy laughter)

1009
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:02,800
Yeah.

1010
01:04:02,867 --> 01:04:05,900
Now, listen, it's gonna take
some powder

1011
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:07,833
To blow that vault.

1012
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,133
We're gonna need
about five minutes

1013
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,967
After you hear the explosion.

1014
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:14,833
I don't want nobody making
any sudden moves.

1015
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,367
Know what I mean?

1016
01:04:17,433 --> 01:04:20,333
No heroes.

1017
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,933
Tell 'em what's
good for 'em, sheriff.

1018
01:04:24,633 --> 01:04:26,667
Just do what he says.

1019
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:28,600
Everybody keep quiet.

1020
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:30,700
Matt.

1021
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,100
Here they come!

1022
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,433
Don't try anything funny, Matt.

1023
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,733
Hey! Hey, there!

1024
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:20,267
(Gunshots)

1025
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:35,667
(Clamoring)

1026
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:38,100
Oh. Papa! Papa!

1027
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,300
He's dead.

1028
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,067
Round up a posse.

1029
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:50,867
I'd say you had a few questions
to answer first.

1030
01:05:50,933 --> 01:05:53,900
How come you to know
this Gentry?

1031
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:58,500
I spent six years
in the same cell with him.

1032
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,067
(Crowd gasps)

1033
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:02,733
LARSON:
Listen to who's been giving us

1034
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,267
Lectures on law and order...
A jailbird.

1035
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,500
Probably in cahoots with him.

1036
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:10,367
That's right.

1037
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:17,467
That's right.
I was a jailbird.

1038
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:19,700
Six years in a stinking cell.

1039
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,967
Because I happen to look
like another man.

1040
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:23,633
Six years out of my life.

1041
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,167
Because men made up
their minds too fast.

1042
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:30,967
Men like you... so righteous,
so willing to condemn.

1043
01:06:31,067 --> 01:06:33,767
The law gave me a full pardon.

1044
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:36,067
If that's not
good enough for you,

1045
01:06:36,133 --> 01:06:38,067
You can have this back.

1046
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:40,067
MAN:
How do we know
he's telling the truth?

1047
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:42,533
SECOND MAN:
Yeah.

1048
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,067
What kind of people are you...

1049
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:49,500
That don't know the truth
when you hear it?

1050
01:06:52,933 --> 01:06:54,700
I learned all about Gentry.

1051
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:56,367
How he thinks, how he acts.

1052
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,133
And now we can make it pay.

1053
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,300
Now, anybody wants
to ride with me,

1054
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:04,233
Get a fresh horse
and plenty of ammunition.

1055
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,133
And you better stay in town
till I get back.

1056
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:18,233
(Speaking Swedish)

1057
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,200
(Speaking Swedish)

1058
01:07:20,267 --> 01:07:22,067
She'll stay with us.

1059
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:24,467
Thanks.

1060
01:07:24,533 --> 01:07:27,067
Be careful, Matt,
please.

1061
01:07:44,467 --> 01:07:47,267
Let's understand each other.
You can head this posse

1062
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:49,167
As long as we think
you're leading it right.

1063
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,133
Start taking us
in circles, Matt,

1064
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,167
And you won't
come back alive.

1065
01:07:55,233 --> 01:07:56,467
Let's ride.

1066
01:08:02,467 --> 01:08:04,767
This time you can use
a deputy.

1067
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:06,433
Thanks.

1068
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,900
Find any trail?

1069
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,067
Nothing up that way.

1070
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:34,200
Must've stayed in the water
to throw us off.

1071
01:08:34,267 --> 01:08:35,600
They have to come out
sooner or later.

1072
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:37,667
Why don't we split up,
follow the stream both ways

1073
01:08:37,733 --> 01:08:39,067
Till one of us
picks up the track.

1074
01:08:39,067 --> 01:08:40,267
Lose too much time.

1075
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,900
How close
are the nearest towns?

1076
01:08:41,967 --> 01:08:43,800
Kirby's about 20 miles
north of here.

1077
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:45,133
And there's another place
called Summerville

1078
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,467
Around the same distance south.

1079
01:08:47,533 --> 01:08:49,067
How about telegraph...
They both got it?

1080
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:51,467
Kirby has, but I ain't heard
of none in Summerville.

1081
01:08:51,533 --> 01:08:53,400
Ah. We'll head south.

1082
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:55,500
Comanche territory?

1083
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,200
Here they are.

1084
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:41,533
Pretty good at thinking
like an outlaw, aren't you?

1085
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,100
I'm a jailbird, remember?

1086
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:16,167
Trail or no trail,
they wouldn't cross that.

1087
01:10:16,233 --> 01:10:19,100
It's four days without water
in Comanche territory.

1088
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:20,900
They'd have to be
crazy to do it.

1089
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,600
LARSON:
Maybe they are,
but I'm not.

1090
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:23,700
Count me out.

1091
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:26,367
Didn't figure on
this kind of a deal.

1092
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:30,367
What about the rest of you?

1093
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:32,233
Come on, make up your minds.

1094
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,433
Once you get out there,
there'll be no choice.

1095
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,833
I'll take my chances
with Gentry, not this.

1096
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,633
SECOND MAN:
I didn't sign up
to take on no Comanches.

1097
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,267
I'm sorry, Matt.
I've got a wife and kids.

1098
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,167
LARSON:
It don't sound right to me.

1099
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:48,000
I ain't riding
into no trap out there.

1100
01:10:48,067 --> 01:10:51,000
Not with just
a handful of men.

1101
01:10:51,067 --> 01:10:52,800
What about you, Matt?

1102
01:10:52,867 --> 01:10:54,267
I'm still sheriff.

1103
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,833
You done your job.

1104
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,533
We don't expect you
to go it alone.

1105
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,500
Let's ride, son.

1106
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:54,467
Gentry would know better
than to leave a trail like that.

1107
01:11:54,533 --> 01:11:56,733
What happens when
we catch up with him?

1108
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,067
A fair question,
but don't worry.

1109
01:11:59,133 --> 01:12:01,933
I didn't come out here
to commit suicide.

1110
01:12:23,533 --> 01:12:24,867
You better save that.

1111
01:12:24,933 --> 01:12:26,967
My mouth's so dry
I can't even swallow.

1112
01:12:27,067 --> 01:12:29,800
Here, put this penny
in your mouth.

1113
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:31,167
It'll keep your tongue wet.

1114
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:45,067
(Wind whistling)

1115
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:50,833
(Horse neighing)

1116
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,600
How long are we
gonna keep going?

1117
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,067
Till we get there.

1118
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:14,867
It's no use, Matt, there won't
be any tracks left to follow.

1119
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:16,300
Then we're going
straight south.

1120
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:18,667
We can pick up their trail
when this blows itself out.

1121
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:20,333
Come on!

1122
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:28,100
(Gunshot)

1123
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:30,100
(Whinnying)

1124
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:39,167
Why did you do that?

1125
01:13:39,233 --> 01:13:40,767
Tell me why.

1126
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,600
You wouldn't quit.

1127
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,167
There was no other way
of stopping you.

1128
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:46,967
Stop me from what?
From catching Gentry...

1129
01:13:47,067 --> 01:13:51,400
Finding out I was in on it.
You... with them?

1130
01:14:03,533 --> 01:14:05,267
Yeah, I was with 'em.

1131
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,700
Ever since you gave me
that prisoner to take in.

1132
01:14:07,767 --> 01:14:09,300
Remember?

1133
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:11,167
He offered me a deal
and I took it.

1134
01:14:11,233 --> 01:14:13,333
Even took that rap on the head
to make it look good.

1135
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:17,433
Working with them.
All this time.

1136
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,867
They needed somebody in town
to set it up for them.

1137
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:21,700
I gave them the idea of Easter.

1138
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:22,933
When everybody'd be
in church.

1139
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,900
All except Pa Swenson.

1140
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:29,067
I couldn't help that.

1141
01:14:29,067 --> 01:14:31,467
Why shouldn't I throw in
with them?

1142
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,400
What was I supposed to do,
hobble up and down

1143
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:35,133
Behind a hardware counter
the rest of my life?

1144
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,133
For $8.00 a week?

1145
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,067
I figured they owed me
a lot more than that.

1146
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:41,800
How are you figuring on me?

1147
01:14:41,867 --> 01:14:44,467
Kept hoping you'd give up.

1148
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:46,800
You didn't leave me
any choice.

1149
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:50,500
It was either you
or a rope around my neck.

1150
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,067
I figure I still got
a pretty good chance.

1151
01:14:56,067 --> 01:14:58,433
You know, if you were smart,
you'd do away with me right now.

1152
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,300
But you're not that kind.

1153
01:15:02,367 --> 01:15:04,767
So you're stuck with me.

1154
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,467
Only, when we
catch up with 'em,

1155
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:08,467
I won't be on your side.

1156
01:15:08,533 --> 01:15:10,500
It'll be one gun against ten.

1157
01:15:10,567 --> 01:15:12,133
But they'll all be
in front of me.

1158
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:18,067
Go pick up your gear.

1159
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,300
There goes your last card.

1160
01:15:38,933 --> 01:15:41,767
One more day,
and they'd have made it.

1161
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,633
Go down and take a look.

1162
01:16:18,467 --> 01:16:21,267
They didn't take the money.

1163
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,733
Bring it up.

1164
01:17:21,467 --> 01:17:23,600
No use straining your eyes.

1165
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:26,067
If they're still around,
we'll know soon enough.

1166
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,067
Let's make some time, then.

1167
01:17:28,067 --> 01:17:31,100
We keep on pushing these horses,
we'll wind up walking.

1168
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:33,467
We will anyhow, if we don't
give 'em a rest soon.

1169
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,167
We better hole up
around here.

1170
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:48,233
Stake them out.

1171
01:17:58,867 --> 01:18:01,533
(Animal howling)

1172
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,667
Coyotes making a meal
off your friends.

1173
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:17,233
So you were a jailbird.

1174
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,200
That why your wife
left ya?

1175
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:28,067
Heard you talking to Helga
on the porch one night.

1176
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,400
You thought I was asleep.

1177
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,233
I know about your son, too.

1178
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,400
That's why the fuss over me.

1179
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:40,267
Not 'cause you liked me.

1180
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:43,400
Just looking for somebody
to take his place.

1181
01:18:43,467 --> 01:18:46,700
Figured this out
all by yourself, didn't you?

1182
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:50,067
I've had a lot of practice
for a long time.

1183
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:55,800
Why don't you stop
feeling sorry for yourself?

1184
01:18:55,867 --> 01:18:57,367
You think you're
the only one in the world

1185
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:58,667
Ever got a raw deal.

1186
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:00,867
I know, you spent
six years in jail.

1187
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:03,133
Yes.

1188
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,400
And do you know something else?

1189
01:19:05,467 --> 01:19:07,367
There's a lot of people
in this world

1190
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,933
Who've had a tougher time
than either you or me.

1191
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:11,267
It comes with the ticket.

1192
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,600
Nobody guarantees you
a free ride.

1193
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:17,533
The only difference is,
most people don't run for cover.

1194
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,200
They keep right on going,

1195
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:21,233
Picking up the pieces
the best way they can.

1196
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,667
But you never hear of them.

1197
01:19:22,733 --> 01:19:25,233
And the ones who
can't take it, like you...

1198
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,433
The ones who're looking
for the free ride,

1199
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,367
Who cause all the trouble
everywhere.

1200
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:33,200
You wouldn't talk so tough

1201
01:19:33,267 --> 01:19:36,333
If this had happened
to your own kid.

1202
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,233
Oh, get some sleep.

1203
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:44,100
You didn't have much luck
with either one of us.

1204
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:46,300
Did you?

1205
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,767
We better get going.

1206
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:16,367
I was thinking
during the night.

1207
01:20:16,433 --> 01:20:18,767
I'm the only one
that knows about you.

1208
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,800
It only takes one.

1209
01:20:20,867 --> 01:20:22,533
Very few men get
a second chance.

1210
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:27,900
You mean that?

1211
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:31,233
(War cries)

1212
01:20:36,467 --> 01:20:37,967
Let's get outta here.

1213
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:40,200
Stay here.

1214
01:20:40,267 --> 01:20:42,200
We can get to the horses.

1215
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:43,467
They'd ride us down
in an hour.

1216
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:47,000
(War cries)

1217
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:54,100
Stay down.

1218
01:20:58,233 --> 01:20:59,667
Maybe they'll go on by.

1219
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:33,633
If they don't spot us
before dark,

1220
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,300
Maybe we can
get across the river.

1221
01:21:43,433 --> 01:21:46,067
It's gonna be a long day.

1222
01:21:57,233 --> 01:22:00,367
Everything set down there?

1223
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:01,967
Everything except the money.

1224
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:03,433
Give it to me.

1225
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,700
If we get separated,

1226
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:12,133
Be sure and get downstream
as far as you can.

1227
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:37,500
I can't make it.

1228
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:41,067
Help me back.

1229
01:26:42,667 --> 01:26:44,933
(Thud)

1230
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,067
(Thud)

1231
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:10,933
MORGAN:
You never saw what happened
to him, huh?

1232
01:27:11,067 --> 01:27:13,600
DAVEY:
I was busy enough
taking care of myself.

1233
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:16,133
Musta swallowed
20 gallons of water.

1234
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,067
You think the money'll
still be there?

1235
01:27:20,067 --> 01:27:22,967
Why not?

1236
01:27:23,067 --> 01:27:24,967
You sure you can
find it again?

1237
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:27,867
All we have to do
is backtrack up the river.

1238
01:27:27,933 --> 01:27:30,967
Suppose the Indians
are still around?

1239
01:27:31,067 --> 01:27:34,300
I could be mighty curious
for $85,000.

1240
01:27:34,367 --> 01:27:36,367
(Laughs)

1241
01:27:40,433 --> 01:27:44,700
You know, this figured out
better than I thought it would.

1242
01:27:44,767 --> 01:27:46,300
All set?
Almost.

1243
01:27:46,367 --> 01:27:48,167
I'll get the horses ready.
Put out the fire.

1244
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:50,400
(Cocks gun)

1245
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,633
Go on.

1246
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:06,867
Go for it.

1247
01:28:06,933 --> 01:28:09,067
How did you...
Just too ornery to die

1248
01:28:09,133 --> 01:28:10,767
Before you got
what was coming to you.

1249
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:12,700
Go ahead, then.

1250
01:28:12,767 --> 01:28:14,433
Get it over with.

1251
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,600
That's what I'm here for.

1252
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:19,067
Go on, shoot!

1253
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:21,433
What are you waiting for?

1254
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:24,100
To see me beg?
Is that it?

1255
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:27,100
Save your breath.
You're gonna need it

1256
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,167
When they put that rope
around your neck.

1257
01:28:29,233 --> 01:28:32,933
You haven't got the guts
to do it yourself.

1258
01:28:33,067 --> 01:28:36,067
That'd be easy, kid.

1259
01:28:36,133 --> 01:28:39,400
But it might do somebody good
to watch you hang.

1260
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:40,667
It might keep some other kid

1261
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:42,467
From turning out
the way you did.

1262
01:28:42,533 --> 01:28:44,933
That's all you're good for.

1263
01:28:45,067 --> 01:28:48,300
You preach real good.
With a gun in your hand.

1264
01:28:50,067 --> 01:28:52,100
I'm not trying to preach.

1265
01:28:52,167 --> 01:28:53,700
Preacher's gotta think
there's something good

1266
01:28:53,767 --> 01:28:55,500
About everybody.

1267
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:57,733
But there's no more good in you
than in a rattlesnake.

1268
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,800
Don't try to blame it
on your leg.

1269
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,767
If it hadn't been that,
it woulda been something else.

1270
01:29:06,067 --> 01:29:08,467
You'd have gone bad
sooner or later,

1271
01:29:08,533 --> 01:29:09,767
No matter what happened.

1272
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:12,567
First time the pressure
got big enough.

1273
01:29:12,633 --> 01:29:15,267
You just didn't have it
in you.

1274
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:18,300
Helga tried to tell me,
but I wouldn't listen.

1275
01:29:18,367 --> 01:29:19,667
I was too smart.

1276
01:29:19,733 --> 01:29:22,200
I was so smart, I thought there
was still a chance for you.

1277
01:29:22,267 --> 01:29:25,267
Still believing,
right up to the very last.

1278
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:28,067
Even broke the law myself
to give it to you.

1279
01:29:28,067 --> 01:29:29,733
Maybe somebody else
coulda found a way

1280
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,733
To get to you
before it was too late.

1281
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,767
You had the whole town
pulling for you.

1282
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:35,567
But you didn't care
who you hurt...

1283
01:29:35,633 --> 01:29:38,533
Swenson, Helga, anybody.

1284
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,767
You're just no good.

1285
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,233
Let's go.

1286
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,067
(Gunshots)

1287
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I thought you were
drawing on me.

1288
01:31:17,767 --> 01:31:19,467
Hold up, there.

1289
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:26,467
With Davey's compliments.

1290
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:53,367
And Davey?

1291
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,333
Davey did fine.
