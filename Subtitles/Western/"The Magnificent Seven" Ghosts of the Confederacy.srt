1
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:18,830
A man-child.

2
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:20,407
- Look, look!
- Gather round.

3
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:25,552
He is a man-child.

4
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:29,965
He shall be called Osceola.

5
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:47,436
Get to your homes.

6
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:54,269
- No, l must be with you.
- No, go.

7
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,507
What is this place?

8
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,667
We are Seminole.

9
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,359
This is our home.

10
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:24,668
We run bunches just like this one
out of Florida.

11
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:26,604
Before the war.

12
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:28,254
Half-breed trash, colonel.

13
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,698
Filthy mix of outlaw lndians
and runaway slaves.

14
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:33,806
You know what to do, captain.

15
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:38,750
Yes, sir. Company dismount!

16
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,732
- Dismount!
- Take food and supplies.

17
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:45,899
l respect no man's law but my own.

18
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:49,303
You can beg your Yankee
carpetbagger government...

19
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,830
... for compensation.

20
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,110
And you tell them...

21
00:02:53,326 --> 00:02:58,559
... the ghosts of the Confederacy
will not die.

22
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,127
You wanna mess with me?

23
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:33,959
Your orders were to take food
and supplies. Nothing more.

24
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:44,638
Well...

25
00:03:45,745 --> 00:03:47,451
... l'll be damned.

26
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,454
Hey, what do you got?

27
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,157
Give me that.

28
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,811
Oh, it ain't nothing
but a bunch of dirt!

29
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:06,621
Colonel!
Look what l found!

30
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:19,426
ls that what l think it is, sir?

31
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,965
This is the face of our new land.

32
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,320
Gold.

33
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:31,900
The ancient alchemist thought
he could turn lead into gold...

34
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:35,070
... but l know l can turn gold
into bullets.

35
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:37,156
Fire!

36
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,915
- Reload.
- Reload!

37
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,918
l would appreciate knowing
where your gold is coming from.

38
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,640
- There is no more.
- No.

39
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:53,061
Of course there isn't. l guess
we need another demonstration.

40
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:55,254
Swing it around.

41
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,403
Swing it around.

42
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:10,094
l'm afraid l must insist on an answer.

43
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:11,923
We have no more gold.

44
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,883
- Carry on.
- No, wait.

45
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,175
Colonel, what if this man
is telling the truth?

46
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,875
lf we had money for arms...

47
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,851
... there are thousands living
under the heels of the Yankees...

48
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:28,228
... who would be willing to join us.

49
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,723
Stand aside, captain.

50
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,465
We will find the gold.

51
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:50,651
There's a mine!

52
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:52,903
There's a mine in the hills!

53
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:11,405
Get the men ready.

54
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:14,013
All right, men. Mount up!

55
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:16,046
Mount up!

56
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:34,234
We will return in seven days.
And that hole will be filled with gold...

57
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:37,115
... or we will fill it with your blood.

58
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,059
Company!

59
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:46,948
- Move out!
- Move out!

60
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:51,970
What we going do? There's no gold.

61
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:54,348
The mines, they collapse years ago.

62
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,842
Would he have believed that?

63
00:06:58,137 --> 00:07:01,846
We got few warriors, no guns.

64
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:04,589
Now we gonna have to leave
before they come back.

65
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,802
Where will we go?

66
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,644
This is now our home.

67
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,920
We must get help.

68
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,353
We cannot go on running.
No. We must stay and fight.

69
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,254
Let me go!

70
00:09:32,925 --> 00:09:34,108
What are you doing?

71
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,830
Town always this lively?

72
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,135
Trail herd from Texas.

73
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:08,634
All liquored up.

74
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:11,136
Got in the mood for a lynch.

75
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,119
Where's the law?

76
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:17,234
Marshal and his deputy.
That isnt even his horse.

77
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:41,475
Stop right there.

78
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:46,426
Step aside, lady.

79
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:49,462
We don't hang men around here
for no reason.

80
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,703
He killed a good man. Said he was
a doctor, but he let him die.

81
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:54,744
l never said l was no doctor!

82
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:58,308
Nathan didn't kill your boss.
Gangrene did.

83
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,013
You ought to be thankful
we're getting rid of this quack.

84
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:04,637
Ain't no darkie doctors.
And there never will be.

85
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,704
You're not hanging that man.

86
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,501
l said, get out of my way!

87
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:12,924
We're late for a funeral, boys!

88
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,195
Get this wagon moving!

89
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,921
Are you people
just gonna let this happen?

90
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:51,603
You walk off with that rifle
and you're fired.

91
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:53,788
Hell, l'm probably gonna
get myself killed.

92
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,990
Now l gotta worry about
a new job too.

93
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:31,722
Hey, mister! Where are we?

94
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:35,964
You get your damn head back in there
if you know whats good for you!

95
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,615
- Hey, this ain't your stop.
- lt is now.

96
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:45,283
This is why l came west.

97
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:54,098
Figure you'd like to watch
your killer swing, Mr. Fallon.

98
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,332
What the hell do you want?

99
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,290
Cut him loose.

100
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:32,877
Reckon y'all would be happier
if you just rode away.

101
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,891
Not a chance, boys.

102
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,586
Shot a lot of holes
in the clouds back there.

103
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:46,403
Anybody stop to reload?

104
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:08,314
l got him.

105
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,277
l got him! l got him!

106
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,505
You don't shoot nobody in the back.

107
00:15:01,353 --> 00:15:05,141
- Name's Chris.
- Vin Tanner.

108
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:07,792
- New in town?
- Yesterday. You?

109
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:09,954
Last week.

110
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:12,099
Buffalo hunter?

111
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:13,985
Among other things.

112
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:15,507
Not many left to hunt.

113
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:29,717
One of y'all wanna pull the knife
out that fellow? Cut me loose here?

114
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,583
Gentlemen, l run the Clarion News.
Where did you come from?

115
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,268
Saloon.

116
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,338
Hey, l wanna talk to you.
Where are you going?

117
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:57,852
- Saloon.
- Saloon.

118
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,780
- The sight's a little off.
- You can keep it.

119
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,237
You know them, Virgil?

120
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:25,883
Don't you recognize that stranger?

121
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,904
The one in black?

122
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:31,286
Chris Larabee.

123
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,317
Whiskey.

124
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:57,042
One for the doc here.

125
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:59,738
Like the man said,
ain't no darkie doctors.

126
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:01,758
l was a stretcher bearer
in the Union Army.

127
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:04,680
Picked up what l could
in the field hospital.

128
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:19,009
We wanna hire you.

129
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,934
Thirty-five dollars, give or take.

130
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:35,402
This may not seem like much to you,
but it's all that we have.

131
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:37,552
How many of these ghosts
are there?

132
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:40,165
Would 20 men scare you?

133
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,754
Hell, l was making $5 a week
at the hardware store...

134
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:44,893
... without anybody shooting at me.

135
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:50,553
Assuming you pay $5 a head,
that gets us all of seven men.

136
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:53,497
The Seminoles risked their lives
for many an escaped slave.

137
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,422
They took us in
when nobody else would.

138
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:58,937
For $5, they can have
a week of my life.

139
00:17:58,937 --> 00:18:00,951
Or all of it.

140
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:08,763
Hell, l wasn't planning on dying
with a broom in my hand anyway.

141
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:16,929
All right. Tomorrow afternoon, then.

142
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:23,811
- We cannot put our trust in them.
- l don't.

143
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,200
lf they're asking for help from
the white man, they're desperate.

144
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,678
But how are we gonna find
hired guns for $5?

145
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:34,320
l think l know a man who can help.

146
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:38,355
l know one too.
lf we can get him out of bed.

147
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,058
Hey, you in there with my wife?

148
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,466
Lord, it's gotta be my Billy.

149
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:44,062
l thought he was in Yuma prison.

150
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,096
Oh, he is. He was.

151
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:48,587
Just a minute, hon.

152
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:50,804
l hear you in there! Open this door!

153
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:53,718
l gotta go.

154
00:18:57,255 --> 00:19:00,122
Someone's gonna get you,
you rabbit.

155
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:07,967
Sorry, ma'am. Wrong room.

156
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,212
Afternoon, Buck.

157
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:15,313
lnterrupt something?

158
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:22,252
Chris. Hey, you old war dog!
Good to see you, buddy.

159
00:19:23,014 --> 00:19:26,279
Easy, big fella. Folks will talk.

160
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:30,134
l got a job. You interested?

161
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:31,856
Yeah. What's it pay?

162
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:34,805
- Five dollars.
- A day?

163
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:38,394
l know it ain't much.

164
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:42,440
- How are the odds?
- Three, 4-1.

165
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,740
Just our kind of fight.
How did you know l was here?

166
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,883
l make a point of knowing
who's in town. Live longer that way.

167
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,029
You with us?

168
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:51,630
ls he with you?

169
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:57,641
There gonna be ladies there?

170
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,074
l imagine so.

171
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:02,955
Then imagine l'm in.

172
00:20:16,434 --> 00:20:19,665
He says he's not coming.
He says that's his penance.

173
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:21,532
- For what?
- He won't say.

174
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,288
Word is, he done killed a lot of men.

175
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:25,864
He's a hard man to persuade.

176
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:28,600
Could be useful in a fight.

177
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,006
The Seminoles are the dispossessed
of the Earth, Josiah.

178
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:37,564
Ain't saving lives
a part of saving souls?

179
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:42,707
Seems to me, a man ought to
put his own house in order first.

180
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:44,901
We can promise you a hell of a fight.

181
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:48,432
Hell?

182
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:52,663
Already been there.

183
00:20:55,507 --> 00:21:00,137
- Think he'll change his mind?
- Maybe. We could ride by tomorrow.

184
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:24,656
Dead center.

185
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:27,885
Let's see you beat that.

186
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:37,434
Stand aside, sir.
You are obstructing my view.

187
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,232
This should be a piece of cake.

188
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,790
- Pay up.
- Nonsense.

189
00:21:57,001 --> 00:22:00,550
l was encumbered by the debris
on the floor.

190
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,891
- Then let's just try it again.
- Pleasure.

191
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,355
Double or nothing.

192
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:10,058
lt's your money.

193
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:13,380
Get ready to duck, boys.

194
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:28,868
He put all six in the same hole.

195
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:32,388
My, my. How astonishing.

196
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:35,471
l've never done that before.

197
00:22:36,207 --> 00:22:39,153
You sure sobered up quickly, mister.

198
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:41,845
Must be the desert air.

199
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:45,834
We don't take kindly
to being hustled.

200
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:51,037
Let's see how good you can shoot
with one eye.

201
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,351
Sorry for the mess.

202
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:20,261
You only got one shot left
in that pop gun.

203
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:24,877
Well, then, you'd best discuss
amongst yourselves...

204
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:27,353
... which one of you is going to die.

205
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,504
- Nice shot, pard.
- Dreadful.

206
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,710
l was aiming to kill him,
but the mirror was cracked.

207
00:23:40,104 --> 00:23:43,255
The first shot was louder
than the other five.

208
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,762
What are you attempting
to suggest?

209
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,737
The first bullet was real.
The rest were blanks.

210
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:55,813
Well, sir...

211
00:23:56,387 --> 00:23:59,732
... l abhor gambling, and as such,
leave nothing to chance.

212
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:03,217
We're looking for guns to protect
an lndian village. You interested?

213
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:05,208
Who's financing?

214
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,351
The village. Five dollars a man.

215
00:24:16,674 --> 00:24:18,619
Five dollars?

216
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:21,520
Wouldn't even pay for my bullets.

217
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,819
Would he be riding with you?

218
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:30,790
Not interested.

219
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:33,392
Reckon you should
be leaving town anyway.

220
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:42,232
l'll sleep on it.

221
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:46,647
Meet us at the livery at dawn.

222
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,862
lf you live that long.

223
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:04,229
Why would we wanna use
a cheater?

224
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:06,413
Might need one.

225
00:25:16,668 --> 00:25:18,613
Fewer ways to split that huge pot.

226
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:21,987
Looks like you gotta shoot straight
for once, old pard.

227
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,943
l hear you fellas
are headed for a fight.

228
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:33,572
My name is J. D. Dunne
and l can ride.

229
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:42,634
And l can shoot.

230
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,502
And he can fly.

231
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:54,833
And he can swim too.

232
00:25:57,842 --> 00:25:59,742
You! Why didn't you grab
my damn horse?

233
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:02,048
Real funny. Nice jacket.

234
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:04,964
- You made it.
- Hell, l couldn't stay away.

235
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:09,301
Not once l saw l'd be riding
with a genuine celebrity.

236
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,388
''The streets ran red
with the blood of 20 men yesterday...

237
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:18,176
... as new resident and notorious
gunslinger, Chris Larabee...

238
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:22,787
... turned our quiet town
into a shooting gallery. ''

239
00:26:32,143 --> 00:26:33,963
l see you've read it.

240
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:40,163
As l recall, your quiet town
was full of drunken scum...

241
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:41,693
... looking to lynch a man.

242
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:46,326
lf l have to bend the facts a little
to keep our town safe...

243
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:50,073
... and if the next bunch of
drunken scum decides to steer clear...

244
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:52,524
... then it was worth
another black mark...

245
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,360
... on your already less-than-stellar
reputation, Mr. Larabee.

246
00:26:57,568 --> 00:27:01,277
You see, l took the liberty
of researching your past...

247
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:03,292
... in my late husband's files.

248
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:07,057
You read secondhand trash
and you think you know a man.

249
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,361
You don't know me.

250
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:15,039
l'm just trying to scare
the bad element away from this town.

251
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:20,864
Lady, l am the bad element.

252
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:58,008
Why'd you change your mind?

253
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:01,648
- The crows.
- What crows?

254
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,150
A sign.

255
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,005
What does that mean?

256
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:08,012
Death.

257
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:11,232
- Whose?
- Probably mine.

258
00:28:11,876 --> 00:28:14,219
Well, well, a sense of humor.

259
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:17,563
l look forward
to many lively conversations.

260
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:20,012
What about all this?

261
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:25,755
These stones will still be here
if l get back.

262
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:35,208
- We can use another good man.
- l'm not so good. But l can fight.

263
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,460
One...

264
00:29:57,682 --> 00:30:00,230
... two, three...

265
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,922
... four, five... .

266
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:11,121
Six. lf you're trying to stay hid,
it's best to remove your hat.

267
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:28,728
Welcome.
We greet you with hostility.

268
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:32,162
l think he means hospitality.

269
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:34,628
Nope. l think he means hostility.

270
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:42,366
Some of our people find it impossible
to trust white men.

271
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:45,530
- And you?
- Not impossible.

272
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,958
Just difficult.

273
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:54,957
You never told us
they had a cannon.

274
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:56,514
You didn't ask.

275
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:59,813
Hey, boys!
Look what l found.

276
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:01,928
Come on.

277
00:31:02,346 --> 00:31:04,052
l was covering you.

278
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:07,399
Making sure you weren't
walking into an ambush.

279
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:12,276
- How did you get here ahead of us?
- l told you, l can ride.

280
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,037
l cut around the canyon rim.

281
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:16,503
Well, l suggest you ride back
the same way.

282
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,002
l can help.

283
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:22,620
- Give me a chance, l'm ready.
- You think you're ready?

284
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:26,788
Let me guess.

285
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:29,234
You learned to ride in prep school.

286
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,228
Then you read some dime-store novel
about Kit Carson...

287
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:35,594
... that got you all fired up.

288
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:41,206
Figured you'd come out west,
try your hand as a gunfighter.

289
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,659
That about right?

290
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:46,690
Go home.

291
00:31:46,891 --> 00:31:48,995
You're not the type.

292
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:52,603
A man comes to you
because he respects you.

293
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:56,062
Because he'd be proud to work
with you. This is how you treat him?

294
00:31:58,436 --> 00:31:59,778
Go home, kid.

295
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:08,756
He is young and proud.

296
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:11,233
Carve that on his tombstone.

297
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,795
l'm an expert at prayers
for the dying.

298
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,649
l like this guy.
Lord help me, l like him.

299
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:22,102
l'm in this for the laughs,
if nothing else.

300
00:32:22,102 --> 00:32:24,033
Let's get started. We got four days.

301
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:25,968
Less.

302
00:32:26,197 --> 00:32:27,505
He is an old warrior.

303
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:32,439
He will come early to surprise us.

304
00:32:37,942 --> 00:32:42,174
His main force
rode straight into the village.

305
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:45,919
Then he left some men back here.

306
00:32:46,784 --> 00:32:48,775
He's a trained soldier.

307
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:50,851
He'll probably repeat himself.

308
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:53,239
Then we should take
the high ground.

309
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:54,640
Yeah.

310
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:59,125
lf we can force him through
this chokehold, we'll have him.

311
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,719
Set that hay over there.

312
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:10,148
We may not have guns...

313
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:13,056
... but we have our ways of fighting.

314
00:33:13,377 --> 00:33:15,925
Anderson will provide the guns.

315
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,266
You ever fired one of these before,
Eban?

316
00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:22,304
They don't give guns to slaves.

317
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:25,535
Well, you're not a slave anymore.

318
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:27,457
Okay.

319
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:29,398
Now take aim at that target.

320
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:31,584
Now, bring it back a bit. Right there.

321
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:34,185
Rest your elbow. Right there.

322
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:36,218
Okay. Now take aim at the target...

323
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:39,415
... and squeeze that trigger gently.

324
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,920
She kicks like a mule, doesn't she?

325
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:45,503
- You okay?
- Yeah.

326
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,336
- All right, who wants to go next?
- No!

327
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:49,649
l can do this.

328
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,622
- Ezra, look.
- Well done, my little craftsmen.

329
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,159
But there is plenty more to do.

330
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,503
- But you said--
- Of course, a deal's a deal.

331
00:33:58,722 --> 00:34:00,349
Gather round.

332
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,268
l did say, if you work,
l'll show you tricks.

333
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:11,800
Pull it tightly against your shoulder.
You got it?

334
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,298
Squeeze the trigger.

335
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:17,159
Still doing your penance, Josiah?

336
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,930
Well, how high you going up?

337
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:29,143
High enough to make a sensible horse
think twice about jumping.

338
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:32,627
Collecting firewood, my friend?

339
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:36,667
We got a battle coming.
l'm boiling us some water.

340
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,408
Gonna be plenty men wounded here.

341
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,685
And dead.

342
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:44,856
All right, children.

343
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:47,984
Let's see what we have wrought.

344
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:51,018
Spectacular.
You've all earned another trick.

345
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:52,664
Gather round. Gather round.

346
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:55,869
lf my lovely assistant
would pass me my blindfold, please.

347
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,710
Thank you very much.
This one is called, ''Aces High. ''

348
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:03,864
Prepare to be amazed.

349
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:09,132
Problem is, you didn't have the gun
pulled tightly against your shoulder.

350
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,164
To find the mystical ace of spades...

351
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:17,266
... one must become sensitized
to its vibration.

352
00:35:17,468 --> 00:35:21,290
Now, of course, l will expect you to
applaud as l have taught you.

353
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:24,736
For, when one is sensitized...

354
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:28,207
... one can better ascertain
its location.

355
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:38,196
Thank you.

356
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:40,925
Nothing at all, l assure you.

357
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,780
Come on out of there, now.

358
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,716
You don't want me
coming in after you.

359
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:13,751
Cut me down.

360
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,745
My father told us they hired
white men to protect our village.

361
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:17,916
Cut me down now.

362
00:36:18,128 --> 00:36:21,438
They sent us here because
these men could not be trusted.

363
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,057
That was probably
real smart of him.

364
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:26,768
You a slave?

365
00:36:27,438 --> 00:36:28,427
Long time ago.

366
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,345
Then you are one of us.

367
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,441
Many runaways
sought refuge with our tribe.

368
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:33,905
Now we are one people.

369
00:36:35,713 --> 00:36:37,704
Now we gonna cut me down?

370
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:42,952
You are strong.

371
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,430
You have a woman?

372
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:47,044
No, ma'am.

373
00:36:47,258 --> 00:36:48,998
Opa-Locka is looking for a husband.

374
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:57,241
That's real sweet, ma'am...

375
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,902
... but can y'all please
cut me down here, please?

376
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:15,079
The wind blew, the clouds parted
and out came the sun.

377
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:18,437
l knew you wouldn't let me down,
you old dog.

378
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:22,447
Well, what do we have here?

379
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,448
Found them up at that canyon.
Actually, they sort of found me.

380
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:28,245
What y'all doing down here?

381
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:30,365
Didn't l tell y'all to stay hid?

382
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,228
ls this not our village too?

383
00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:34,779
Why should we hide
while our grandfathers defend us?

384
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:37,172
l say we let them stay.

385
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:39,524
You touch my daughter,
l promise l'll kill you.

386
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:42,913
Which one is your daughter?

387
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:46,548
No harm will come to your women.

388
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,899
Let them stay, Tennessee.

389
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:15,410
Well, the hat is a marvelous touch.

390
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:41,461
Howdy, how you doing today?
You new in the village?

391
00:38:42,106 --> 00:38:44,176
You look beautiful,
l gotta tell you right now.

392
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:46,115
Have you met my friend here?

393
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:49,266
My name's Buck, by the way.

394
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:54,728
Hard to get out.
There we go.

395
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:04,607
Excuse me.

396
00:39:07,698 --> 00:39:09,518
Ladies.

397
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,305
For the bandages.

398
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,302
Who are you?

399
00:40:11,528 --> 00:40:14,076
Nobody you need to use
that pigsticker on.

400
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:17,973
- Why are you in my village?
- Hey, l'm one of the good guys.

401
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,486
You're wearing the wrong skin.

402
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:38,193
l got him!

403
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:46,131
You stupid son of a... .

404
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,533
You damn near shot me.

405
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,415
lmala, he has come back.

406
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:57,887
lmala.

407
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:01,083
Buck, let him go.

408
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:11,230
lmala. lmala. lmala, my son.

409
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,764
l thought you were dead.

410
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:16,949
l escaped from
the white man's prison.

411
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:19,951
Do you know why l was in prison?

412
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,481
For the crime of not being white.

413
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:29,362
And what do l find when l return?

414
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:32,402
These white men.

415
00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:33,792
That's it!

416
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:35,956
What in the blue blazes
we doing here, then?

417
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:39,218
Risking our lives for a chunk of gold
that wouldn't even fill a tooth.

418
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:41,600
And why would l die for you?

419
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,567
lmala.

420
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,783
Your son.

421
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:01,903
He is called Osceola,
for the spirit of his father.

422
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:28,872
He'd be dead right now,
if it weren't for me.

423
00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:31,648
- You damn near shot my ear off.
- But l didn't, did l?

424
00:42:31,868 --> 00:42:33,608
l saved your life. Twice.

425
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,795
- Twice.
- You think l couldn't handle him?

426
00:42:36,006 --> 00:42:37,906
Don't use the butt of your gun
as a weapon.

427
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:41,259
You keep smacking it around like that,
before long it's gonna misfire.

428
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:45,233
And another thing,
get rid of this damn stupid hat.

429
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:50,755
What Buck means is, ''thanks, '' kid.

430
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:53,058
- l just wanna prove to you that l can--
- Save it.

431
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:57,283
lf you wanna die young, stay.

432
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,075
Yes!

433
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:18,243
This guy's crazy.

434
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:27,478
There's a little backwater town
up in the Texas panhandle. Tascosa.

435
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,592
Flatter than
a felt-covered poker table.

436
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:33,630
You know it?

437
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:37,134
- Heard of it.
- lf l wind up getting killed...

438
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:40,519
... take my body back there.
You'll get 500 for it.

439
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:44,140
How come you're so valuable?

440
00:43:47,077 --> 00:43:48,499
Well...

441
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:51,454
... when the buffalo done run out,
l became a bounty hunter.

442
00:43:51,682 --> 00:43:53,468
l was going after Eli Joe...

443
00:43:53,684 --> 00:43:55,424
... a bandit who had
shot up a few banks.

444
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:58,840
Two-hundred-dollar reward,
alive or dead.

445
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:02,401
l found him dead.
Took the body in.

446
00:44:03,493 --> 00:44:05,393
Except it wasn't him.

447
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:08,496
Old Eli had framed me up
for murder.

448
00:44:08,765 --> 00:44:11,757
Since l didn't do it, l decided not
to stick around for the hanging.

449
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:14,516
Wound up with a hefty bounty
on my own head.

450
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:19,971
So l figure, if a friend collects,
l get the last laugh.

451
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,326
Why'd you sign on, Josiah?

452
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:35,707
What is it you expect to gain?

453
00:44:38,361 --> 00:44:41,148
Saw the birds of darkness
in a dream.

454
00:44:42,032 --> 00:44:46,583
When l woke up, a crow
was sitting on my windowsill.

455
00:44:46,803 --> 00:44:48,703
Staring at me like the devil himself.

456
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:50,467
Why come here?

457
00:44:51,374 --> 00:44:53,114
lf death's coming...

458
00:44:53,543 --> 00:44:55,647
... l'd just as soon meet it head-on.

459
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:58,553
Gonna get your reward
in the hereafter?

460
00:44:59,149 --> 00:44:59,899
No.

461
00:45:00,851 --> 00:45:02,921
No, l was a... .

462
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,411
l was a priest once.

463
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:09,323
But l had a little trouble
turning the other cheek.

464
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,449
l did a turn
preaching the word myself.

465
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:15,939
- ls that right?
- Best swindle l ever knew.

466
00:45:15,939 --> 00:45:18,158
Just stand up there under that tent...

467
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:21,838
... terrify the congregation
with a vision of hellfire...

468
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:24,427
... and pass the collection plate.

469
00:45:24,427 --> 00:45:25,916
Yeah.

470
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:32,827
Did fine too. Until l attempted to save
the soul of the mayor's daughter.

471
00:45:34,184 --> 00:45:35,526
Yep.

472
00:45:37,954 --> 00:45:40,946
Saving souls has its hazards.

473
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,800
Time's up.

474
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:00,017
Everybody, take your positions!

475
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:37,012
l thought you said there were 20.

476
00:46:38,381 --> 00:46:41,202
No, l asked if 20 would scare you.

477
00:46:41,885 --> 00:46:44,957
Twenty, no. Forty, yes.

478
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:44,740
Sand.

479
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:49,450
My instructions could not
have been more explicit.

480
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:52,208
You were very explicit, colonel.

481
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:56,576
And yet for some reason,
they were not carried out.

482
00:47:56,993 --> 00:48:02,101
l have shot my own men for less!

483
00:48:08,571 --> 00:48:11,916
Colonel Emmett Riley Anderson
of the Confederate States of America.

484
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,132
And you are... ?

485
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:15,911
There's no gold here, colonel.

486
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:20,111
No, of course there isn't.
You're here for your health.

487
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:21,659
Or the company perhaps?

488
00:48:21,885 --> 00:48:23,625
We came to ask you to leave.

489
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:26,337
And purely out of the goodness
of your hearts.

490
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:29,230
Yep. Something like that.

491
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,007
Well...

492
00:48:32,963 --> 00:48:36,512
... how many of you
humanitarians are there?

493
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:38,517
Enough.

494
00:48:41,705 --> 00:48:44,253
What do you say, captain?

495
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:46,514
You think there's gonna be trouble?

496
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,814
No trouble, colonel.
Just turn around and ride out.

497
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:55,747
l like that.

498
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:57,528
Audacity.

499
00:48:57,854 --> 00:49:01,438
Move on, colonel.
These people have nothing you want.

500
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:04,034
Shoot them down, captain.

501
00:49:05,328 --> 00:49:07,751
Company.

502
00:49:07,964 --> 00:49:09,147
Fire!

503
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:29,518
Now.

504
00:49:30,987 --> 00:49:32,249
Come on, pull!

505
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:37,634
Watch it, over there.

506
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,089
Thattaboy, thattaboy, fire!

507
00:51:29,038 --> 00:51:32,064
- Stand and fight, damn you!
- For God's sake, colonel!

508
00:51:40,116 --> 00:51:42,186
We're almost gone, colonel, let's go.

509
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,445
Damn it all to hell. Sound retreat!

510
00:51:46,656 --> 00:51:48,681
Come on!

511
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:50,962
Retreat!

512
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:54,429
Now!

513
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,869
Come on!

514
00:53:00,363 --> 00:53:02,263
Oh, God.

515
00:53:17,714 --> 00:53:21,616
Ride on, colonel. Ride on.

516
00:53:35,965 --> 00:53:37,148
We have won.

517
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,820
You people fought well.

518
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,463
- We fight well together.
- We whipped them good, old pard.

519
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,591
Buck, get up on that ridge,
keep a lookout.

520
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:54,329
Hell, they won't stop running
till they hit the Rio Grande.

521
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:57,279
- l'll take first watch.
- All right.

522
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,600
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

523
00:54:00,823 --> 00:54:03,246
Oh, it's not my blood.

524
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:07,940
Damn lucky it isn't your blood, son.

525
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:11,190
Now, you don't fan your guns.
That spoils your aim.

526
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:16,031
One good shot is better
than six bad ones.

527
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:18,479
Anything else?

528
00:54:18,975 --> 00:54:21,205
No, that's about it for now.

529
00:54:40,663 --> 00:54:43,211
l prefer to use it for healing.

530
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:47,955
Keep pressure on that.

531
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:02,156
Let me see that arm.

532
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:06,678
lt's fine. l just bruised it when l fell.

533
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:10,393
No, no, no. That ain't no bruise, now.
Let me see.

534
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:12,696
l said, it's fine.

535
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,069
Suit yourself.

536
00:55:25,942 --> 00:55:28,331
Just like l thought, you dislocated it.

537
00:55:28,331 --> 00:55:29,694
lt'll be sore for a while...

538
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:31,982
... but you still have
two hands to cheat with.

539
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:44,508
Rest easy, friend.

540
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:47,912
- Not good.
- Whoever your god is...

541
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:51,341
... you can go to him in peace.

542
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:54,233
Leave him.

543
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:58,823
We don't believe in your
white man's religion.

544
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,889
Nor do l, my friend.

545
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:10,324
He been hit.

546
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:28,842
Look like the bullet
went clean through.

547
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:30,585
But he lost a lot of blood.

548
00:56:30,807 --> 00:56:33,196
Why didn't you tell us
you were hurt?

549
00:56:33,196 --> 00:56:35,162
You didn't ask.

550
00:56:37,613 --> 00:56:40,002
Your birds lied, Josiah.

551
00:56:42,351 --> 00:56:44,535
We shall see.

552
00:57:08,077 --> 00:57:09,738
ls he all right?

553
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,235
Wasn't like them dime-store novels,
was it?

554
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:22,009
l didn't count on seeing their eyes.

555
00:57:22,225 --> 00:57:24,967
Well, if you can see their eyes,
then you're too close.

556
00:57:25,194 --> 00:57:27,458
And you never break cover.

557
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:30,584
You stand in front of bullets,
you're likely to die.

558
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,586
You done, Buck?

559
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:36,898
- Slow down a little, son.
- What gives you the right...

560
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:39,131
... to tell me what to do?

561
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:53,912
He had a son once.

562
00:57:54,123 --> 00:57:57,115
Never had a chance
to see him grow up, though.

563
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,742
He lost that boy...

564
00:58:00,963 --> 00:58:02,783
... and his wife...

565
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:04,739
... in a fire.

566
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:09,677
And that burned half the soul
out of that man.

567
00:58:16,946 --> 00:58:19,050
Josiah, you still with us?

568
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,352
Scoot on over there, Buck.

569
00:58:29,525 --> 00:58:31,948
l'm a spiritual man.

570
00:58:39,268 --> 00:58:42,533
Sometimes l turn to
the wrong kinds of spirits.

571
00:58:49,145 --> 00:58:53,297
Your fate is in the cards,
gentlemen. Remember that.

572
00:58:53,516 --> 00:58:54,824
What's my fate?

573
00:58:58,788 --> 00:59:02,292
You shall grow to be a great warrior.

574
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:06,598
- Big, strong and fearless.
- Like you.

575
00:59:12,268 --> 00:59:14,736
There are two kinds of people
in this life, my friend.

576
00:59:15,471 --> 00:59:19,498
Those who seek battle
and seem not to fear death...

577
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:21,970
... like them.

578
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:26,947
And those who avoid battle,
but will stand and fight to the death...

579
00:59:27,149 --> 00:59:30,494
... if their loved ones are threatened.

580
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:32,426
Like them.

581
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,543
That is true courage.

582
00:59:39,562 --> 00:59:45,387
Now, you have lost to me at poker
and l have read the cards for you.

583
00:59:45,601 --> 00:59:47,387
The time has come to pay.

584
00:59:47,737 --> 00:59:49,318
You see...

585
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:55,604
... l've heard tell of a gold mine
in these parts.

586
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:58,809
We're not to speak of it.

587
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:01,916
Well, good.
Then it is a valuable secret.

588
01:00:02,118 --> 01:00:06,464
One such secret
could wipe out all your debts.

589
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:08,362
So...

590
01:00:09,425 --> 01:00:12,292
... let's talk about this mine...

591
01:00:13,262 --> 01:00:14,763
... shall we?

592
01:00:18,634 --> 01:00:20,295
- He's beautiful.
- Yeah.

593
01:00:20,503 --> 01:00:22,892
l've had many children.

594
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:25,017
l've outlived most of them.

595
01:00:25,241 --> 01:00:27,869
Now, all of these are my children.

596
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:32,791
Home, family...

597
01:00:33,082 --> 01:00:35,471
... things worth fighting for.

598
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:53,381
El Dorado.

599
01:00:57,173 --> 01:00:59,562
- What's cooking?
- Chili and beans.

600
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,039
Well, we'll be back in two hours.

601
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:04,672
- lt'll be ready.
- Who's on watch?

602
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,225
- Ezra replaced me a couple hours ago.
- All right.

603
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:45,424
This must have caved in years ago.

604
01:01:45,424 --> 01:01:48,772
Right, we'll take a wider arc across
the plain. Make sure they're gone.

605
01:01:49,992 --> 01:01:52,096
What the hell is that?

606
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:55,692
lt's the cannon.

607
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,516
Fire!

608
01:02:06,742 --> 01:02:09,210
Bring it around. Reload.

609
01:02:09,879 --> 01:02:11,107
Move it!

610
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:17,292
Ready. Fire!

611
01:02:22,825 --> 01:02:24,531
Few more rounds,
they'll have the range.

612
01:02:24,531 --> 01:02:26,467
Lower the damn elevation.

613
01:02:29,265 --> 01:02:30,607
Come on.

614
01:02:34,103 --> 01:02:35,843
Fire!

615
01:02:42,745 --> 01:02:44,645
Colonel, that village
has no fortifications.

616
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:46,553
We're wasting powder and shot.

617
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:47,273
Waste?

618
01:02:49,552 --> 01:02:53,022
Men who survived the battles
at Shiloh and Bull Run...

619
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:55,611
... the finest sons of the South.

620
01:02:55,611 --> 01:02:58,533
And they die here?

621
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:02,772
l'll wipe this place
from the face of the earth.

622
01:03:04,466 --> 01:03:07,811
l'll fire rocks if l have to.

623
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,752
- Fire!
- Ready, fire!

624
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:19,036
Reload!

625
01:03:19,248 --> 01:03:21,990
Everybody, into the bluffs.

626
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:25,608
That cannon will tear
these adobes apart.

627
01:03:27,223 --> 01:03:27,943
Ready!

628
01:03:31,126 --> 01:03:33,594
Come with me. Come on.

629
01:03:35,664 --> 01:03:39,134
Go! There! Leave it! Leave it!

630
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:40,290
Fire!

631
01:03:46,609 --> 01:03:48,236
Father?

632
01:03:49,712 --> 01:03:56,060
Oh, God, not my dad.
Oh, my God.

633
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:58,117
We got to go!

634
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,390
- We got to go, Rain!
- Why?!

635
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,463
Come on.

636
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:12,315
Down! Down! Everyone, down!

637
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,685
- What the hell happened to Ezra?
- l don't know.

638
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:21,333
Reload!

639
01:04:24,246 --> 01:04:25,429
Fire!

640
01:04:30,386 --> 01:04:31,853
We got to get them out of here!

641
01:04:32,054 --> 01:04:33,237
Come on. Come on.

642
01:04:33,455 --> 01:04:35,355
Then there's a third kind.

643
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:38,241
Fire!

644
01:04:46,068 --> 01:04:46,818
Go.

645
01:04:48,971 --> 01:04:51,917
We got two options.
We can ride up after that gun--

646
01:04:52,141 --> 01:04:55,372
- That's no option. That's suicide.
- Or? What's the other option?

647
01:04:55,577 --> 01:04:57,317
We raise a white flag.

648
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:06,436
Reload!

649
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:10,092
Or three, we can mount up
and we can ride the hell out of here.

650
01:05:10,092 --> 01:05:12,954
Go, then. But with my last breath,
l will fight these men.

651
01:05:13,162 --> 01:05:15,426
Them Rebs up there.
That makes it my fight.

652
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:17,451
l'm not going.
l haven't shot anyone yet.

653
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:20,328
They'll see us coming up that trail
before we get five paces.

654
01:05:20,536 --> 01:05:24,040
And that gun is gonna
cut us to pieces.

655
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,263
There's gotta be a way up there.

656
01:05:28,477 --> 01:05:30,661
There is. We can climb.

657
01:05:40,923 --> 01:05:42,424
You remember why we're doing this?

658
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:45,206
- Does it make any difference?
- Guess not.

659
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:07,715
My hands are shaking so bad, Buck.
l can barely hang on.

660
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:10,066
- Good.
- Good?

661
01:06:10,285 --> 01:06:12,071
Yeah, good.
Means your juices are flowing.

662
01:06:12,287 --> 01:06:14,949
Fear keeps you sharp, kid.

663
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:17,038
- Buck?
- Yeah.

664
01:06:17,259 --> 01:06:19,443
You are full of crap.

665
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:21,819
Just figuring that out now?

666
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,740
Come.

667
01:06:32,508 --> 01:06:35,932
l didn't go to West Point.
l'm really just a sergeant.

668
01:06:36,145 --> 01:06:38,648
Well, you're a captain now,
so speak up.

669
01:06:38,648 --> 01:06:42,476
l think we should save ammunition
and give them a chance to surrender.

670
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:44,072
Fire!

671
01:06:44,286 --> 01:06:49,713
Well, thank you
for your advice, captain.

672
01:06:49,925 --> 01:06:51,995
You keep firing.

673
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:56,836
And hired killers, captain.

674
01:06:57,533 --> 01:06:59,034
Not soldiers.

675
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:01,338
You may
be underestimating them, sir.

676
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:03,843
Keep firing.

677
01:07:09,144 --> 01:07:10,394
Fire!

678
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:43,510
Surrender or die where you stand.

679
01:07:44,446 --> 01:07:47,438
l'll take that $5 now.

680
01:08:10,038 --> 01:08:14,350
One battle don't win the war, boys.
Chain them up, Sergeant Darcy.

681
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:17,330
Make them nice and tight, boys.

682
01:08:19,915 --> 01:08:23,100
l was there, in Shiloh, captain.

683
01:08:23,318 --> 01:08:25,183
l know you were at Shiloh, colonel.

684
01:08:25,387 --> 01:08:27,935
Union lines had broken.

685
01:08:28,357 --> 01:08:30,746
They were in full retreat.

686
01:08:31,293 --> 01:08:34,285
There was no way
they could counterattack.

687
01:08:36,665 --> 01:08:38,485
But they did.

688
01:08:39,434 --> 01:08:43,427
Our surviving officers
were herded up like cattle.

689
01:08:44,273 --> 01:08:49,176
Forced to watch
as they raised their Union flag.

690
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:53,307
Then they fired off that cannon.

691
01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:56,123
And we were all left for dead.

692
01:08:56,785 --> 01:09:00,255
l lay there amongst that carnage...

693
01:09:00,255 --> 01:09:04,448
... surrounded by the bodies
of my dead brothers.

694
01:09:08,163 --> 01:09:09,790
Well...

695
01:09:10,365 --> 01:09:14,187
... we gonna raise the Stars and Bars
over that little village.

696
01:09:15,437 --> 01:09:21,069
l want it to be the last thing
these boys ever see.

697
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:25,922
All right, now,
let's get some muscle behind it!

698
01:09:25,922 --> 01:09:28,344
Move it up over that flat now.

699
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,290
How do you like
the Wild West now, kid?

700
01:09:30,519 --> 01:09:32,669
You all think you got me pegged,
don't you, Buck?

701
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,845
A rich kid, had it all.

702
01:09:35,057 --> 01:09:37,207
Yeah, l lived in a mansion.
My mother was a maid.

703
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:38,575
Never knew my father.

704
01:09:38,794 --> 01:09:42,025
They made me a stable boy
and l taught myself how to ride.

705
01:09:45,834 --> 01:09:47,904
Mama died last year.

706
01:09:47,904 --> 01:09:51,049
She'd saved a little money,
wanted me to go to college.

707
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:53,373
lt wasn't enough.

708
01:09:55,844 --> 01:09:57,994
Life's tough, huh?

709
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:00,281
And then you die.

710
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,094
Mind not leaning against my bad leg?

711
01:10:09,992 --> 01:10:13,257
Are you ordering all these prisoners
to be executed, sir?

712
01:10:14,596 --> 01:10:15,699
That is correct.

713
01:10:16,331 --> 01:10:18,196
But, colonel,
these men surrendered.

714
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:22,188
Then we shall reward them
with a quick and merciful death.

715
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:25,636
They shall not be made to suffer,
as l was.

716
01:10:27,442 --> 01:10:29,387
That's murder, sir.

717
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:32,915
Are you refusing my order,
Corcoran?

718
01:10:32,915 --> 01:10:34,935
Colonel.

719
01:10:37,185 --> 01:10:40,655
Colonel, we've been riding together
for a long, long time, you and l.

720
01:10:40,856 --> 01:10:43,802
Your orders have saved my life
more times than l can remember.

721
01:10:44,693 --> 01:10:47,241
- But this time... .
- Yes?

722
01:10:49,965 --> 01:10:52,115
l can't do it, sir.

723
01:10:52,801 --> 01:10:55,508
- But that's treason.
- Treason?

724
01:10:56,905 --> 01:11:00,056
Treason against what?
The war is over, sir.

725
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:16,396
Darcy!

726
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:20,762
You disappoint me, Francis.

727
01:11:20,762 --> 01:11:22,350
Sir?

728
01:11:23,498 --> 01:11:25,921
This man is stripped
of rank and privilege.

729
01:11:26,368 --> 01:11:28,188
You're hereby promoted to captain.

730
01:11:28,804 --> 01:11:31,193
Place the mutineer
among the other prisoners...

731
01:11:31,193 --> 01:11:33,034
... and execute them all.

732
01:11:34,142 --> 01:11:35,291
All, sir?

733
01:11:35,644 --> 01:11:38,829
l think l made myself clear,
Captain Darcy.

734
01:11:40,716 --> 01:11:45,585
When our flag reaches the top
of the staff, execute the prisoners.

735
01:11:45,787 --> 01:11:47,368
Yes, sir.

736
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:53,136
Yes, sir. Private.

737
01:12:29,297 --> 01:12:31,447
How about it, Johnny Reb?

738
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,110
l bet you never thought your boss
would go loco on you.

739
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:39,041
l'll have you know, Colonel Anderson
was one of the finest soldiers...

740
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:41,345
... in any man's army.

741
01:12:41,643 --> 01:12:42,792
l owe my life to him.

742
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:45,367
And soon your death.

743
01:12:57,526 --> 01:13:01,189
Captain, l gotta go get rid
of some of this coffee.

744
01:13:30,425 --> 01:13:32,495
Set up the flagpole over there.

745
01:13:58,353 --> 01:13:59,502
Well...

746
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:05,991
... l hear the clank of gold bars
and the roar of the guns...

747
01:14:06,194 --> 01:14:08,583
... as we hit back at the Yankees.

748
01:14:08,797 --> 01:14:10,537
Here's what we gonna do now.

749
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,242
We gonna have us a little
flag-raising ceremony.

750
01:14:15,103 --> 01:14:18,607
Then we gonna execute us
some prisoners with our little cannon.

751
01:14:19,274 --> 01:14:21,697
Then you gonna show me
where that mine is.

752
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:24,322
There is no gold in that mine.

753
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:29,957
Oh, no, of course not.

754
01:14:31,686 --> 01:14:33,347
You gonna show me, old man.

755
01:14:36,424 --> 01:14:37,607
About time.

756
01:14:41,062 --> 01:14:43,610
l wouldn't wanna miss this.

757
01:14:43,832 --> 01:14:45,140
Nobody move or he's dead.

758
01:14:47,335 --> 01:14:50,327
l leave you boys alone for five minutes
and look what happens.

759
01:14:50,539 --> 01:14:53,804
You'll only get one shot off
before we take you.

760
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:59,194
Then you'd best
discuss amongst yourselves...

761
01:14:59,414 --> 01:15:01,314
... which one of you is going to die.

762
01:15:07,088 --> 01:15:08,316
Pick him yourself.

763
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,360
Well...

764
01:15:14,563 --> 01:15:17,430
... then l guess l'll just have to take
all of us.

765
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:22,193
Why, that powder keg's empty,
mister.

766
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:29,171
Drop it.

767
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:36,049
Raise the colors.

768
01:15:45,226 --> 01:15:46,932
Big mistake, sonny boy.

769
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:48,993
You shouldn't have tried that.

770
01:15:49,197 --> 01:15:53,543
l know. l can't imagine
what came over me.

771
01:16:30,905 --> 01:16:32,532
You're outnumbered 3-1.

772
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:35,403
Anderson's a mad dog.
You'll all die.

773
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:38,602
We know what to do with a mad dog.

774
01:16:43,118 --> 01:16:45,382
Don't ever run out on me again.

775
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,080
Take me with you.

776
01:16:54,929 --> 01:16:56,999
l know him. l know him.

777
01:16:56,999 --> 01:16:59,143
l know his methods.

778
01:16:59,143 --> 01:17:00,722
l'll kill him.

779
01:17:21,923 --> 01:17:24,153
Give me that glass, soldier.

780
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:30,131
What the hell?

781
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:32,554
- Troop B.
- Yes, sir?

782
01:17:32,767 --> 01:17:33,722
Check out that cannon.

783
01:17:35,336 --> 01:17:37,281
- Come on, now.
- Come on.

784
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:39,381
Come on.

785
01:17:50,852 --> 01:17:52,843
Let's finish this.

786
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:58,998
All right, you men
take the high ground.

787
01:17:58,998 --> 01:18:01,344
Man the approaches.

788
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:18,433
Drop your guns...

789
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:21,403
... or join your friends.

790
01:18:24,986 --> 01:18:26,647
Much obliged.

791
01:18:26,855 --> 01:18:29,961
Show yourselves, damn it.

792
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:33,184
Show yourselves.

793
01:18:39,467 --> 01:18:41,412
Show yourself.

794
01:19:09,364 --> 01:19:10,353
Come on, let's go.

795
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,330
Troop C, run them down.

796
01:19:17,705 --> 01:19:18,888
Watch it over there.

797
01:19:26,714 --> 01:19:29,262
He's up there! He's up there!

798
01:19:33,288 --> 01:19:35,438
Get down, get down, get down!

799
01:19:37,492 --> 01:19:41,644
Get Anderson.
No matter what, get Anderson!

800
01:19:46,634 --> 01:19:48,374
Come on!

801
01:20:05,687 --> 01:20:06,870
l can't hit him.

802
01:20:07,088 --> 01:20:10,034
- Show them what you're made of.
- Come on!

803
01:20:27,308 --> 01:20:29,538
Bastard won't go down.

804
01:20:33,848 --> 01:20:35,156
You can't kill me.

805
01:20:36,885 --> 01:20:41,117
l'm a ghost of the Confederacy
and l will not die.

806
01:20:41,322 --> 01:20:43,745
He's so full of laudanum,
you could chop his head off...

807
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:46,586
- ... and he wouldn't feel it.
- Well, he'll feel this!

808
01:20:57,372 --> 01:20:58,794
Finish it!

809
01:21:29,837 --> 01:21:31,225
Sir.

810
01:21:54,162 --> 01:21:56,153
This has to stop, sir.

811
01:21:59,534 --> 01:22:01,923
Francis...

812
01:22:02,136 --> 01:22:04,878
... you were like a son to me.

813
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,429
Don't make me do this, sir.

814
01:22:10,945 --> 01:22:12,207
My God.

815
01:22:15,783 --> 01:22:17,887
You're a coward.

816
01:22:41,376 --> 01:22:43,082
The war's over.

817
01:22:43,478 --> 01:22:44,900
Go back to your families.

818
01:22:51,953 --> 01:22:53,739
He's dead.

819
01:22:55,990 --> 01:22:58,220
lt's finished now.

820
01:23:07,335 --> 01:23:09,200
Hey, pard.

821
01:23:09,637 --> 01:23:11,343
We got him.

822
01:23:11,706 --> 01:23:13,526
We did.

823
01:23:14,742 --> 01:23:18,246
- Buck.
- Hey, kid...

824
01:23:19,847 --> 01:23:21,189
... do me a favor.

825
01:23:23,484 --> 01:23:25,475
Get yourself a real hat.

826
01:23:28,222 --> 01:23:31,373
Never did get to spend any time
with those fine ladies.

827
01:23:31,592 --> 01:23:35,301
You will. But first let's get you
stitched up, Buck.

828
01:23:53,815 --> 01:23:55,999
lt's lmala's.

829
01:24:08,463 --> 01:24:10,931
You fought with him.

830
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:13,896
Not against him.

831
01:24:34,322 --> 01:24:36,472
Where you headed?

832
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:41,435
- Tascosa.
- Tascosa? Why?

833
01:24:41,896 --> 01:24:45,047
Never know how much time there'll be
to set things right.

834
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:47,497
They got a saloon there?

835
01:24:49,103 --> 01:24:50,684
l reckon.

836
01:24:51,339 --> 01:24:53,000
Leaving?

837
01:24:53,207 --> 01:24:54,834
Yes.

838
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:01,430
Never could figure out
how to split it seven ways.

839
01:25:02,016 --> 01:25:04,405
Use it again.
Next time you're threatened.

840
01:25:05,353 --> 01:25:09,426
Oh, the next time we will welcome
our enemies with great hospitality.

841
01:25:10,992 --> 01:25:13,734
- l think you mean hostility.
- No, hospitality.

842
01:25:14,362 --> 01:25:17,388
l will even open the doors
of my home to them.

843
01:25:21,836 --> 01:25:23,622
That'll do it.

844
01:25:24,772 --> 01:25:27,798
You will always be welcome
in our village.

845
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:33,140
My friend.

846
01:25:33,347 --> 01:25:35,895
Hey, kid. lf you're not
gonna wear that hat...

847
01:25:36,317 --> 01:25:38,057
- ... then l'll take it back.
- Buck.

848
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:43,050
You look awful.

849
01:25:43,257 --> 01:25:45,407
Well, son,
that's damn near impossible.

850
01:25:52,567 --> 01:25:54,592
You riding with us?

851
01:25:55,236 --> 01:25:57,466
Try and keep me away.

852
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:02,625
Don't make me laugh, kid.

853
01:26:11,586 --> 01:26:13,451
Ezra, can l come?

854
01:26:13,654 --> 01:26:15,963
A brave warrior like you?

855
01:26:16,257 --> 01:26:17,963
You gotta stay
and protect the village.

856
01:26:20,027 --> 01:26:21,654
You remember what l taught you?

857
01:26:21,862 --> 01:26:24,251
Never draw to an inside straight.

858
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,222
What about you, Mr. Jackson?

859
01:26:35,443 --> 01:26:38,185
You willing to ride
with an old Southern boy?

860
01:26:38,185 --> 01:26:42,566
l figured l'd stick around for a while.
Help these folks get things right.

861
01:27:00,234 --> 01:27:02,418
You shoot a cannon
pretty well, pard.

862
01:27:02,637 --> 01:27:05,629
Dreadful.
l was trying to hit Anderson.

863
01:27:07,341 --> 01:27:09,286
Where you going?
Get down off that horse.

864
01:27:09,286 --> 01:27:11,980
You lost too much blood, now.
You gonna die out there.

865
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,441
lf that's what's meant to be.

866
01:27:13,648 --> 01:27:16,799
Your birds will get you soon enough.
You don't have to go chasing them.

867
01:27:17,718 --> 01:27:19,868
You're a good man, Nathan.

868
01:27:24,258 --> 01:27:25,282
Go.
