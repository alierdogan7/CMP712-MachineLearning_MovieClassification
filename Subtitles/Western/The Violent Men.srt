1
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:54,544
Hey, Jed, take a look at his left hind shoe,
will you?

2
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,983
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Good morning.

3
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,143
- Mr. Parrish.
- Yeah?

4
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:05,581
I'd get off the street if I were you.

5
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:09,383
And I'd stay off
while that Anchor outfit's in town.

6
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:47,779
- How goes it, Elena?
- Is Cole coming to town?

7
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,586
I don't think so. But I'm in town.

8
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,181
- When he come?
<i>- Who knows? Mañana,</i> maybe.

9
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:54,825
What are you doing today?

10
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,340
When you see Cole, tell him...

11
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,987
No, you no tell him anything.
I wait till he come.

12
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:18,823
So, you're itching to get married
and start on your honeymoon.

13
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:27,145
I've always considered
honeymoons barbaric.

14
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:31,625
Throwing two people together on a trip
before they've become properly acquainted.

15
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:39,225
You're lucky that Confederate bullet
went clean through you.

16
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:43,095
There's nothing so deadly
as a Yankee surgeon probing around.

17
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:46,099
- The war's over, Doc.
- You can put your shirt on.

18
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,497
Men always find reasons
to avoid living in peace.

19
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:52,702
Take this valley.

20
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:56,746
You wouldn't think there'd be any cause
to put blood on the landscape, would you?

21
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:58,021
It's not my war.

22
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:02,020
It's been my observation that a man's
appetite grows by what it feeds on.

23
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:04,985
And there's no hunger
like the hunger for land.

24
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:07,985
It swallows everything and everybody.

25
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,583
Men like Wilkison: land-eaters.

26
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,822
Understand you're losing
another neighbour.

27
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:18,456
Your friend Mahoney,
forced to sell, like all the rest.

28
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:20,339
I suppose it's your turn next.

29
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,783
You'll either have to run like they did,
or stand and fight.

30
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,656
That's not what I came here to find out, Doc.

31
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:28,863
If it's your health you're concerned about,
don't be.

32
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,859
With reasonable care,
you'll outlive most of us.

33
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:33,779
Then it's safe for me to go back East?

34
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:37,576
You can tell Caroline Vail there's nothing
to stop you from marrying her now.

35
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,500
She's asked me often enough
how you were getting along.

36
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:43,738
I never saw a girl more concerned.

37
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:47,137
- So, you're going east?
- Yeah, I'm going for good.

38
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:50,100
What are you going to do about your ranch?

39
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,175
Well, Lew Wilkison
wants to talk to me about it.

40
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,224
So he's forcing you out, too.

41
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,977
Now, nobody's forcing me out, Doc.
I'm going because I want to go.

42
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,377
I can't spend my life raising cattle.
It's not my business.

43
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:07,105
Besides, I'm a stranger around here, Doc.
Always have been and always will be.

44
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,020
All that grass and sand ever meant to me
the past three years...

45
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:12,098
was a place to regain my health.

46
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,986
Now I've got it,
there's nothing to hold me here any longer.

47
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,298
Except what you owe the land
and your neighbours.

48
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,139
I don't owe anybody anything.

49
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:24,379
You came out here to die, Mr. Parrish.
This country gave you back your life.

50
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:26,584
And you still owe it nothing?

51
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,065
What happens in this valley
is no concern of mine.

52
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,546
- Thanks, Doc.
- Goodbye, Mr. Parrish.

53
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:49,187
No, I was only joking.

54
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:52,543
I didn't really mean
that Mr. Wilkison stole my land.

55
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,825
We don't like them kind of jokes, Mahoney.

56
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:58,536
But honest,
I didn't mean it that way. Honest.

57
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,859
I ain't complaining.
Mr. Wilkison gave me a good price.

58
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:05,496
- I ain't complaining.
- Not much.

59
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:07,858
Don't.

60
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:16,623
Mr. Parrish, better keep out of this.

61
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,217
You can't do anything without a gun.

62
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,697
Matlock, that's enough.

63
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:24,823
You keep out of this.
This is Anchor business.

64
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:26,784
What happens in this town is my business.

65
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:30,143
You boys get back to your cards and liquor,
or get out of town. One or the other.

66
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:34,061
For a man old enough to know better,
you pick the dangdest places to get drunk.

67
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:35,262
Get out of here.

68
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:38,737
- Stay put.
- You're all primed for trouble, aren't you?

69
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,863
Go ahead, pull that gun or hand it here.

70
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:44,178
Well, I'm a patient man,
but don't keep me waiting too long.

71
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,066
Pay my respects to Mr. Wilkison.

72
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,149
Tell him I recommend he sends you packing.
Because if he don't, I will.

73
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,701
Mahoney, get out of here.

74
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,948
Stay where you are.

75
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,989
Stay where you are
until these witnesses get done talking.

76
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,627
I intend to get justice done fast.

77
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,096
Now, who's seen what happened?

78
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,556
They weren't after Mahoney.

79
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,664
They used him as a decoy
to murder the Sheriff.

80
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:34,889
You mustn't go around saying
things like that about Mr. Wilkison's men.

81
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,858
- Caroline's right.
- Why look for trouble?

82
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,689
That Deputy Magruder, he let the killer go
because he works for Wilkison.

83
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,688
Maybe the Sheriff forced his hand,
like they said.

84
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,156
That's the first time I've ever seen
one man shoot another man in the back...

85
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,875
just to protect himself.

86
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,939
And I just stood there.

87
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:54,915
John, you're just upset
from seeing a man killed.

88
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,659
Mr. Vail, I saw too many men killed
in the war for just one more to upset me.

89
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:02,709
There's something big
building up in this valley.

90
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,803
In the Army,
we used to call it enemy pressure.

91
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:10,066
First, Wilkison's brother Cole comes back
from Texas to help him run Anchor.

92
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,288
Then a tough kid with a fancy gun
shows up on the Wilkison payroll.

93
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,862
Then all the small ranchers
are forced out, one by one.

94
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,386
Anchor riders tearing up the fences,
stampeding, shooting.

95
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,938
Well, you got to expect that
in cattle country.

96
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,303
The farmers to the south of me
are getting the same kind of pressure.

97
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,779
The same kind of offers,
practically nothing for their land.

98
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,589
Now Mahoney's out, the Sheriff's dead...

99
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,230
and I'm invited to Anchor to talk business.

100
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,183
You mean Mr. Wilkison
wants to buy your place?

101
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,183
That's wonderful, honey.
We can get married and go east right away.

102
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,908
You can't deal with a man who sends
six killers to shoot an old man in the back.

103
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,343
- But that has nothing to do with us.
- Of course not.

104
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,820
You can't let that stand in the way
of Caroline's happiness and yours.

105
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,061
Wilkison's the only one here
who can afford to pay you a decent price.

106
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,459
Doesn't give him the right
to push people around.

107
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,826
You can't argue with a man
who started with a few acres of land...

108
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,186
and now owns practically the whole valley.
You must go see him.

109
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,420
Please, John, for us.

110
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,666
I'm sorry, Caroline. I just can't.

111
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,185
- I'd better be getting back to my place.
- Aren't you staying overnight?

112
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,579
No, I want to make sure
my men don't get into any trouble.

113
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,788
I've got a couple of hotheads
who'd like to take a shot at a Wilkison rider.

114
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,659
Good night.

115
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,983
- Good night.
- Good night.

116
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,822
You'd better think it over.

117
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,709
I'd sooner sell now, than to be forced later.

118
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,781
I've thought it over, Mr. Vail.

119
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,059
John.

120
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,543
I'm sorry, not even saying goodbye.

121
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,548
Honey, you hurt Mother's feelings,
leaving like that.

122
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,629
But then, they are kind of silly, aren't they?
The way they keep at us.

123
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,783
I guess I'm out of the habit of taking advice.

124
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,943
I've been running my own affairs
since I joined the Army.

125
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,099
The Army.

126
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,263
The way you talk, anyone would think
it was the one big thing in your life.

127
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,225
Well, perhaps it was, until I met you.

128
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,580
I like you to say things like that,
even if you don't mean them.

129
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,023
I do mean it.

130
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,780
Honey, talk to Mr. Wilkison. Please.

131
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,228
I know how you feel about it,
but try to understand.

132
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,060
Don't you think that I want to sell out,
marry you, and take you East with me?

133
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,788
You don't understand.

134
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,581
I'm afraid of what will happen to you
if you stay here.

135
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,138
You once told me you were tired of fighting.

136
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,589
I just won't deal with Wilkison.

137
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,299
Honey, please, for my sake.

138
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,462
I don't want to lose you.

139
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,302
I love you. What do I have to do?

140
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,783
Promise me you'll go to Anchor.
Promise me.

141
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,546
Good evening, Miss Vail.

142
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,418
Or should I say good morning?

143
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,861
You're drunk again, George.

144
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,541
A man has to console himself when his girl
strolls off with somebody else...

145
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,509
into a stable.

146
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,899
I'm not your girl, and leave me alone.

147
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,026
Go back to the saloon, where you belong.

148
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,989
- Decent people don't want you around.
- Decent? Caroline?

149
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,662
I don't have to account to you.

150
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,581
You had your chance,
and you gambled it away.

151
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,739
I'll get more money.

152
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,186
You'd be surprised
how many rich relatives I have in Boston.

153
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,909
They don't want you around,
and I don't, either.

154
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,466
- Don't you?
- You'll never take me out of this town.

155
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,266
What do you want?
A man or a railroad ticket?

156
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,145
I want to get out of here.
And nothing's going to stop me.

157
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,063
Martin, Davis, and Tony
are riding herd, Captain.

158
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,228
I had McCloud get you together
because I want you to know in advance...

159
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,904
that I'm selling the ranch and going east
just as soon as I can.

160
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,389
- The doctor say you could?
- That's right, Jim.

161
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,865
Anybody that wants to
can start packing for another job...

162
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,589
with an extra month's pay
just as soon as roundup is over.

163
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,104
There's no need for you
to wait around for the new owner.

164
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,624
Why not? Don't you think he'll want us?

165
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,461
Well, you may not want him.
I'm selling out to Wilkison.

166
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,150
You're going to hand over your place
to Lew Wilkison?

167
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,461
I'm not handing it over.
He wants to buy, and I want to sell.

168
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,666
- I guess that's all Mr. Parrish has to say.
- No, it isn't.

169
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,179
It may take a little while
to get the deal worked out.

170
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,909
In the meantime,
I don't want anybody running any risks.

171
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,742
I don't want any heroes on my payroll.

172
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,142
I may not be much of a cattleman, but so far
nobody's been hurt working for me.

173
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,422
I want it kept that way. Is that understood?

174
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,859
None of us wants to get hurt, Mr. Parrish.

175
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,704
But I ain't hightailing it from any
Anchor riders who come picking a fight.

176
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,269
I know what you mean, Bud.

177
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,581
I ain't forgot how they smashed
my pa's fences, and tried to ride him down.

178
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,106
My pa says never go looking for trouble.
Try to talk your way out of it.

179
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,420
But it didn't work with Wilkison's bunch.

180
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,263
I know, Bud, but I must do it my way.

181
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,309
Sure, Mr. Parrish.

182
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,701
- Saddle my horse. I'm going to Anchor now.
- I sure hope you have some luck.

183
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,822
Thank you, Bud.

184
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,899
Mr. Purdue.

185
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,302
I came to learn if it's true you're selling
to that bunch of vultures over at Anchor.

186
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,383
- Do you know a better buyer?
- Only Wilkison's got that kind of money.

187
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,829
Mr. Parrish, for what it's worth
to remind you...

188
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,027
my dad and mother helped you
that first winter you came out here.

189
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,384
When you were near to dying.

190
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,789
I haven't forgotten.

191
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,782
Then don't sell to Anchor.
We are the last of the small ranchers.

192
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,179
We can't count on those farmers
to fight back.

193
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,058
I'm sorry, but you can't count on me.
Has nothing to do with my being ungrateful.

194
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,584
- I'll never forget your help.
- Then show it.

195
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,304
I had nothing to do with starting your feuds,
and I'm not going to become involved.

196
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,462
Twelve years ago,
Anchor riders killed my oldest boy.

197
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,184
They beat him up so bad,
he died in his mother's arms.

198
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,421
It was their way
of trying to drive me out of this valley.

199
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,981
I have fought Wilkison ever since, and I'll
keep on fighting him until one of us is dead.

200
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,706
And I regard no man worth that much
who will have dealings with him.

201
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,262
Capt. Parrish, they tell me
you served with Gen. Kirkpatrick in Georgia.

202
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,829
That's right.

203
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,545
From over on our side, we got the idea
he led a mighty tough bunch of boys.

204
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,384
But I guess they always look tougher
coming at you than running away.

205
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm not going to Anchor for trouble.

206
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,548
Do you always provide an armed escort?

207
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,428
If you have any trouble with our men,
why don't you complain to them?

208
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,307
Or take it up with my father?

209
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,622
Perhaps I will, Miss Wilkison.

210
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,668
I must say, you got here faster...

211
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,948
than any of the others who came
to sell their land at my father's invitation.

212
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,147
I can't quite make you out.

213
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,583
Not wearing a gun, for instance.

214
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,343
I'm sure you know one end from the other,
being in the Army.

215
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,581
But just why do you set yourself apart
from everyone else here?

216
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,900
And you're so modest
about your military record...

217
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,867
when other men would brag about it.

218
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,748
And your illness,
how brave you were about that.

219
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,263
Are you just trying to be different,
Mr. Parrish, or is it something else?

220
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,387
- Well, since you know so much about me...
- But I don't.

221
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,385
I doubt if anyone here really knows you.

222
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,146
Either you're just too good to be true,
or you're clever and careful.

223
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,989
And I don't like clever and careful people.

224
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,660
You're trying to pick a fight with me. Why?

225
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,062
Go inside, Mr. Parrish.
My father and uncle are waiting for you.

226
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,063
You might get half of what you want
if you don't show them you're frightened.

227
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,347
That's strange advice,
coming from a Wilkison.

228
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,778
I was hoping that at least you would...

229
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,505
I really have no right
to be disappointed in you.

230
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,902
After all, it isn't your concern
to stay here and fight, or is it?

231
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,342
Mr. Parrish, please come in.
We've been expecting you.

232
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,862
How do you do, Mrs. Wilkison?

233
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,066
Please forgive Judith
for keeping you waiting outside.

234
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,106
- I hope she wasn't rude.
- Not at all.

235
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,660
- She merely expressed her opinion of me.
- She can be trying at times.

236
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,380
But then you're not interested
in the problem of raising a daughter.

237
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,626
My husband will be down shortly.

238
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,426
You must be awfully thirsty
after riding in this heat all day.

239
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,908
What a pity, Mr. Parrish.
We've been neighbours for three years...

240
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,424
and now our first meeting must be our last.

241
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,343
I understand you're leaving the valley,
going East.

242
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,269
Let me have my crutches.
I don't need any help.

243
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,620
I may be only half a man, but I can still...

244
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,099
Lew dear, I asked Cole
to help you down the stairs.

245
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,226
You've been fussing over me for 12 years.

246
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,346
- Lew, please.
- All right, Martha, all right.

247
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,148
Come and meet Mr. Parrish.

248
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,020
You're younger than I thought.

249
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,021
What were you captain of? A nursery?

250
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,340
Lew dear, Mr. Parrish is our guest.

251
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,063
You know my brother, Cole.

252
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,424
Come and sit down.

253
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,063
- Cole, pour the Captain a drink.
- No, thanks.

254
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,229
In this country, it's good manners
to accept a man's liquor.

255
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,540
- I don't drink.
- You're a liar.

256
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,022
Now what's really bothering you?

257
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,103
Maybe seeing Sheriff Kenner shot
in the back spoiled my taste for your liquor.

258
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:26,899
Will you believe me when I tell you
that I'm sorry about Kenner?

259
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,385
He was a friend of mine.
We came to this country together.

260
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,822
We had our squabbles, sure.

261
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,383
Especially after he started standing up
for every shirttail farmer that came here.

262
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,268
Why, he wouldn't give us
extra protection from the law...

263
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,864
that a big outfit like Anchor was entitled to.

264
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,020
But I never figured he needed killing.

265
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,898
Needed or not, he's dead.
Wade Matlock, one of your men, shot him.

266
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,187
Not on my orders. If I wanted him killed...

267
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,546
I'd have dragged myself into town
and done the job myself.

268
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,107
When I heard
what that gun-happy pipsqueak did...

269
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,829
I ran him out of here so fast
his tail is still burning.

270
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,902
Cole, pour the Captain a drink now.

271
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,579
Sit down.

272
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,863
I hear you want to sell out and go back East.

273
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,067
The climate here
fixed that bullet hole in your lungs?

274
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,540
Wish it could do the same for my legs.

275
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,585
Yes, I'm willing to sell if I get a fair price.

276
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,423
- How much do you want?
- How much will you pay?

277
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,381
Place of yours ain't worth much.

278
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,700
All I want is my money out of it.

279
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,588
You paid too much. They took you.

280
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,788
I have no intention of selling my ranch
for one penny less than I put into it.

281
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,907
I don't have to sell, whether I decide
to stay here or go on back East.

282
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,949
I've got a good foreman and a good crew
who can run my ranch without me.

283
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,349
Or until I find a buyer who will pay my price.

284
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,103
They'll run it for you.
Will they fight for you?

285
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,581
Now that's no way to trade, Cole.
No need to get rough.

286
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,669
Here in Anchor,
we don't pay much attention...

287
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,628
to this hogwash
about the meek inheriting the earth.

288
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,469
I'll level with you.

289
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,105
Anchor needs grass. All it can get.

290
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,221
To feed the biggest herd of cattle bearing
one man's mark in this or any territory.

291
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,705
I built this ranch up from nothing.

292
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,783
I started with a scrawny herd,
drove in from Missouri...

293
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,100
with not enough ground to feed them.

294
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:31,781
Froze here in the winter, when the ground
was so hard I couldn't break it with an axe.

295
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,428
Summers were worse.

296
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,261
I fought tornadoes, Indians, snakes,
and squatters.

297
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,065
Squatters who wouldn't let me spread out.

298
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,989
They held a line across the valley,
kept me hemmed in.

299
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,344
And before they died or sold out
or moved away...

300
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,705
they made sure I couldn't break through.

301
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,623
They'd sell to each other
or to outsiders like you.

302
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,060
They even let farmers squat on it.

303
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,109
Nesters who gut the range with
their ploughs so no cattle can graze on it.

304
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,228
Well, we ended shooting each other up,
12 years ago.

305
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,341
I still didn't get the land.

306
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,663
All I got were these.

307
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,346
I can't walk on them, Mr. Parrish.

308
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,340
Lew dear, stop reliving the past.
You mustn't upset yourself.

309
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,582
They stopped me, but not for long.

310
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,109
I've got all the small ranchers out,
except you and Purdue.

311
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,547
So don't let's hear any foolishness
about your keeping that ranch.

312
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,348
You're selling out, Captain.

313
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,342
One way or another, you're selling out.
To us.

314
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,781
How high are you willing to go?

315
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,389
- Cole, what was that figure we settled on?
- $15,000.

316
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,139
That wouldn't even be a down payment.
My stock alone is worth more.

317
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,142
We don't figure that way.

318
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,509
We figure what it's worth to us
to get you off the land without fighting.

319
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,504
Not that you could ever hold out
for any length of time against Anchor.

320
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,543
But why spill any more blood in this valley?

321
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,707
We'll give you 24 hours. Think about it.

322
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,908
- Goodbye, Mrs. Wilkison.
- I'll see you to the door.

323
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,823
Why provoke him deliberately,
offering so little?

324
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,425
For a few thousand dollars more you
could have his place without any trouble.

325
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,185
Parrish is too sure of himself.
Had to knock him down a few pegs.

326
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,829
He'll be back.

327
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,585
And we'll get it at our price, Martha.

328
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,384
I don't know how
you could be married to me this long...

329
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,904
and not learn my way of doing business.

330
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,499
- Maybe that's what I like about you.
- Is that all?

331
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,579
Cole.

332
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,148
- Had the Mahoney fences torn down yet?
- I'm sending the men out in the morning.

333
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,026
I'd have done it
the minute he was off the place.

334
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,828
Send them out now.

335
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,505
I can't spare anybody now.
What's your hurry?

336
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,578
If you'd waited for the land
as long as I have...

337
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,581
But then you wouldn't know
what it is to be corralled.

338
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,308
To have fences all around you.

339
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,142
No, I guess I wouldn't.

340
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,949
Come here, Martha.

341
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,465
Look at it.
The valley's almost yours, Martha.

342
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,459
I'm going to run the Anchor wall
clear around the whole valley.

343
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,749
I promised that when I brought you here
and I'm going to make that promise good.

344
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,502
I never doubted you would.

345
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,588
Come, Lew dear.

346
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:15,819
There.

347
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,021
Now, I'll go see about dinner.

348
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,500
- Oh, Martha.
- Yes.

349
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,786
We'll have dinner early.

350
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,858
- Martha.
- There.

351
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,704
Martha, it's about Judith.
I'm worried about her.

352
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,707
She's been keeping to herself,
won't eat with us.

353
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,825
I heard her crying in her room.
What's wrong with her?

354
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,825
I didn't want to mention it.
I've been worried about her, too.

355
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,029
- She doesn't like living here.
- What, at Anchor? Why should she...

356
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,828
It's hardly the place for a young girl.

357
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,141
No friends her own age,
no chance to meet eligible young men.

358
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,143
We should send her East.

359
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,825
I've been in touch with a finishing school
in Baltimore. It's just the place for Judith.

360
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,822
- What did she say to that?
- Well, she won't listen.

361
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,541
Stubborn like her father?

362
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,506
Tell her to have dinner with us.

363
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,907
- You weren't here last night.
- That's right.

364
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,663
Where were you?

365
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,423
- Mahoney's, looking the place over.
- And you stayed there all night?

366
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,501
Look at me when I talk to you.

367
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,702
All right, I'm looking.

368
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,304
You were with that Mexican girl again
last night.

369
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,427
- I told you where I was.
- Don't lie to me. I know all about her.

370
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,070
I know what she looks like,
and the cheap perfume she uses.

371
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,618
I've smelled it on you often,
after you've come home.

372
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,348
I know where you keep her in town.
I've heard talk.

373
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,022
I know she followed you here from Texas.

374
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,066
What, do you believe everything you hear?

375
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,586
Cole, don't cheapen yourself.
Send that Mexican girl away.

376
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,186
One of these days you'll be running Anchor.
You'll have position, respect.

377
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,263
- Is that all you think of, the ranch?
- I'm thinking of you, of both of us, together.

378
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,341
Didn't I talk Lew
into bringing you back here?

379
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,866
Sure, because you needed me here
to run Anchor for you.

380
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,823
Yes, I needed you,
but not for the reason you think.

381
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:57,380
I've never stopped loving you,
all the years we were apart.

382
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,064
I wanted you back here a long time ago.

383
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,979
I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you,
if you didn't go with it.

384
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,469
But I know my brother.

385
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,509
When I get the valley clear for him,
he's going to kick me out, like he did before.

386
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,421
No. Not this time.

387
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,540
I've lived with half a man for 12 years.
I hate myself and him.

388
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:27,426
I've played the part of a loving wife,
when I can't bear the touch of his hands.

389
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,818
Cole, you're the only happiness I have here.

390
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,950
Don't do anything to destroy it,
please don't.

391
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,662
Send the Mexican girl away.

392
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,429
No one will ever love you as I have.
You know that.

393
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,980
- You want to know where I'm going?
- No.

394
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,219
I'm going to make sure Parrish sells.

395
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,180
- Be careful of him.
- He doesn't even wear a gun.

396
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,501
They didn't make him Captain in the cavalry
for nothing.

397
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,222
I'll keep that in mind.

398
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,067
Judith, I've been looking for you.

399
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,301
- I thought you were in your room.
- Did you, Mother?

400
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,381
There's no excuse for rudeness.

401
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,269
We've both been concerned
about your strange behaviour.

402
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,261
- My behaviour, Mother?
- Yes.

403
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,462
You've been sullen, you've ignored me,
you've shown me no respect.

404
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,700
Do you deserve respect, Mother?

405
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,145
I don't know what on earth
you're talking about.

406
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,982
I wish you'd tell me, dear.

407
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,663
Very well, I'll tell you.

408
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,106
Your father would like you
to have dinner with us this evening.

409
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,545
Then he can hear what you have to say.

410
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,386
Wilkison offered me $15,000,
and 24 hours to think it over.

411
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,746
He's certainly not going
to bankrupt himself for this spread.

412
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,741
You think that's a fair offer?

413
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,029
What do you want me to say?

414
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,466
I want you to tell me the truth.
I want you to tell me he's trying to steal it.

415
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,065
The question is, am I going to stand for it?
Do you know the answer to that?

416
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,186
- Captain...
- The answer is yes.

417
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,143
I'll make it look real good.
I'll wait a few days, and then I'll go back.

418
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,779
Then I'll act real hard to sell,
but I'll settle for $15,000.

419
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,909
Yeah, I promised Caroline I'd take any offer.

420
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,939
For a moment there I thought you were
going to turn out to be a real human...

421
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,464
with a temper and pride, everything.

422
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,508
I saw a lot of proud men get killed
during the war, proving absolutely nothing.

423
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,829
And temper is something only
the very strong or the very rich can afford.

424
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,302
- My father taught me that very early.
- He did a real good job of teaching.

425
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,463
We just seen a bunch of Anchor riders
heading to the hills.

426
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,110
Looks like they're on their way
to Purdue's place.

427
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,385
- Anchor riders?
- I thought you might want to know.

428
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,461
Some of the boys are riding out there
to take a look.

429
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,701
I said I didn't want any heroes
on my payroll, didn't I?

430
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,745
Where are you going?

431
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,219
To stop any of the men
from getting into trouble.

432
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,778
There's no harm
in taking a look at Purdue's.

433
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,784
You're bound to get me into this fight
one way or another, aren't you?

434
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,063
You're on Anchor land.

435
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,987
I said you're on Anchor land.

436
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,263
- Not on this side of the hill.
- On any side.

437
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,788
If I were you, I'd start moving.
I wouldn't stop till I was out of the valley.

438
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,462
Matlock, I work for Parrish.
I take my orders from him.

439
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,788
No sense of asking for trouble.
We don't want you to get hurt, do we?

440
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,822
Now get going.

441
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,540
This will help Parrish make up his mind.

442
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,706
It wasn't Purdue they were after.

443
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,627
Mr. Parrish, he said it's to help you
make up your mind.

444
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,465
Who said that? Who?

445
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,023
Matlock.

446
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,024
- You fellows wanted to see me?
- That's right.

447
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,508
I guess you know this was one of my men,
Bud Hinkleman.

448
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,909
Hinkleman.

449
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,542
It seems I recollect a nester family
that lives south of here named Hinkleman.

450
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,944
Since when do cattlemen
hire nester brats to do their riding for them?

451
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,179
Bud Hinkleman worked for me.
He worked hard. And now he's dead.

452
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,069
I expect the law to take care of his murderer.

453
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,259
Now, Mr. Parrish...

454
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,979
we've got here
what you might call a peculiar situation.

455
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:36,864
You see, after listening to this fella
you sent to fetch me...

456
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,623
I stopped in at Morgan's
on my way over here.

457
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,185
It happens I had seen Wade Matlock in there
a while before.

458
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,304
I sort of put the question right up to him.

459
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,948
I'll tell you now,
I just rightly don't know what to do.

460
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,298
It seems clear enough to me.

461
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,388
Well, that's because you don't know
the other half of it.

462
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,061
Here's you and all your men ready to tell me
that Wade Matlock shot this young boy...

463
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,345
early this morning out in the hills.

464
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,704
The trouble is, there's twice as many
Anchor riders ready to swear...

465
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,429
that Wade didn't take one step
out of that saloon.

466
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,943
Not since last night.

467
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,260
So it looks to me like this dead boy must
have made a mistake as to who shot him.

468
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,744
Or you and your men
misheard what he was trying to tell you.

469
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,904
Meaning you don't feel justified
in making an arrest.

470
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,946
Now, Mr. Parrish, you're a reasonable fella.

471
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,626
You know I can't arrest nobody on what
a dying man was supposed to have said.

472
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,548
It ain't like I had a regular witness, now,
is it?

473
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,823
- We could swear out a warrant.
- Say, that you could.

474
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,186
Judge Benson will fix one up for you,
and I'd serve it all right.

475
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,023
Being an officer of the law, I'd be bound to.

476
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,707
I'd put Wade Matlock in jail
and see that he got a trial.

477
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,943
But just between you and me,
I've got a hunch he'd be acquitted.

478
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:57,183
Nothing personal intended, Mr. Parrish...

479
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:00,780
but out here we just don't take kindly
to strangers who come among us...

480
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:04,180
and try to use our law
to settle their private grudges.

481
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:09,621
If I was you, I'd think it over real careful
before I started making out warrants.

482
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,619
I see what you mean, Sheriff.

483
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,385
One more thing.

484
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,863
There'll be no lynching,
not where I hold the law. Understand?

485
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,066
So get your men out of town
and see that they behave peaceful.

486
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,825
Or I'll throw the lot of them in jail.

487
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,383
- Where do you think you're going?
- Get out of the way.

488
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,698
You heard what the Sheriff said.

489
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,702
- We're through listening to you and him.
- Please step aside.

490
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,065
Coming from the East, you don't understand
how we look at this.

491
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,983
- The law's the law.
- The law is working for Anchor. You know it.

492
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,061
Go ahead, walk into a trap.

493
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,665
Get yourself killed.
That's just what they want.

494
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,866
They're waiting for you now
over at Morgan's.

495
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,185
But if you go over there,
better look behind you.

496
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,262
That's where Magruder will be,
with a whole force of deputies.

497
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,745
Don't you see?
That's what he's trying to do.

498
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,264
Draw you into action,
then Anchor can kill you legally.

499
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,949
What would you do?

500
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,186
- You mean if I were handling it?
- Yes.

501
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,749
Well, seeing as I was outnumbered,
I'd probably let them think I was retreating.

502
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,104
I'd pick my own battleground.

503
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,750
In that way,
I wouldn't be taking on the law, too.

504
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,139
I'd have the element of surprise on my side.

505
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,267
That is, if I wanted any part of it,
which I don't.

506
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,789
What's more, any of you that goes over
to Morgan's, no longer works for me.

507
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,506
I'm spending the night at Vail's.

508
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:38,299
I'll see you at the ranch in the morning
if you change your mind.

509
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,018
If not...

510
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,385
I'll have the pay ready
for any of you that survive.

511
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,505
No, I think I'll give that to Bud's father.

512
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,622
- You lost your way, mister?
- No.

513
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,023
I'm looking for Wade Matlock.

514
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,266
The Sheriff mentioned he was in here.

515
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,023
You're looking at him. What's on your mind?

516
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,661
I own the ranch next to Anchor.
My name's Parrish.

517
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,428
Is it all right if I move? This gentleman
has a gun pressed against my back.

518
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,783
Yeah, thanks.

519
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,898
I'd like a drink. I mean, if you don't mind.

520
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,143
- Have another.
- No, thanks.

521
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:12,102
- One's my limit. Doctor's orders.
- Have another. My orders.

522
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:17,142
Well, if you insist.

523
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,909
One of my men was killed this morning.
And I thought...

524
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,698
You wouldn't be hinting I did it, would you?

525
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,184
Bud said you did.

526
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,467
- You shouldn't believe everything you hear.
- Oh, I don't.

527
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,269
That's why I came here, to talk to you.

528
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,107
Since the Sheriff wouldn't take any action...

529
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,148
my men thought
they'd take the law into their own hands.

530
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,427
They seemed quite determined.

531
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,110
I'm afraid they might cause a lot of trouble.

532
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:54,389
So I thought if I could persuade you
to give yourself up and stand trial...

533
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,749
What's going on here?
Stay right where you are.

534
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,508
Yeah, but he's getting away.

535
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,263
Well, Mr. Parrish, this is a strange place
for you to come today.

536
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,346
I'm sure my father will be interested
in what you have to say.

537
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,861
I suppose I owe you an apology.

538
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,268
I once accused you
of being a clever and careful man.

539
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,821
After what you did last night,
you're anything but that.

540
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,582
Matlock was too confident.

541
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,823
You make it sound as if
you shot him down in cold blood.

542
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,423
Maybe I did.

543
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,983
And you're coming here?

544
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,858
Matlock wasn't the kind
to have any friends after he was dead.

545
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,260
This belonged to your hired killer.

546
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,818
The one you said you booted out of here.

547
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,862
If I said so, I did.

548
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:32,389
You made me an offer for my ranch,
and you gave me 24 hours to think it over.

549
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,022
Then you tried to help me make up my mind
by killing Bud Hinkleman.

550
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,782
That was none of my doing.

551
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,820
Now, what else have you got to say?

552
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,662
My ranch isn't for sale.

553
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,627
You don't have enough money
to buy me out.

554
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,701
Or enough men to drive me out.

555
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,862
I've got a big stake in this valley.
I've got certain rights.

556
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,827
Bud Hinkleman had certain rights, too.

557
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,188
The right of any human being to live
his own life for as long as God intended.

558
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,620
You know, Mr. Wilkison, we're going
to be neighbours for a long time.

559
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,224
It's up to you
whether or not we live in peace.

560
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,382
I came here to stop this killing
before it went any further.

561
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,906
But I warn you,
I'll fight for the privilege of being let alone.

562
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,429
And I can take care of anything you
or your hired gunmen can throw against me.

563
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:15,829
Now you listen to me.

564
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,947
There's nothing you can do on my range
that I can't do on yours.

565
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,624
And you've got a lot more to lose
than I have.

566
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,507
Now, don't force me to fight...

567
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,459
because you won't like my way of fighting.

568
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:45,902
When I said to kick Wade Matlock
off the ranch, I meant it.

569
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,628
You wanted me to clear out the valley.

570
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,826
My orders were to do it
without spilling blood.

571
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:51,548
Since when are your hands so clean?

572
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,222
When I had fighting to do, I did it myself.

573
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,620
I didn't hire killers to shoot a man
in the back, or to ambush one rider.

574
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,143
You promised not to upset yourself.

575
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,859
Don't tell me how you did your fighting.
They stopped you cold.

576
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,422
You sat behind the same fences
for 12 years...

577
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,785
till I blasted the range open for you.

578
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:10,430
- lf you think I can't do without you...
- Just say the word.

579
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,863
Will both of you stop?

580
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:15,181
How can you carry on like this
with no concern of what it means to me?

581
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,068
After all,
I talked you into bringing Cole back.

582
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,028
If I thought you still couldn't get along,
after so many years...

583
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,589
I'm sorry, Martha.

584
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,702
I thought Cole would make things easier
for you. And he has.

585
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,384
He's done a good job since he's come back.

586
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,984
If Mr. Parrish weren't so stubborn,
the valley would be yours.

587
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,220
I'm not saying Cole is right
in whatever he's done.

588
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:37,268
My only concern is for you.
I want you to have peace.

589
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,864
I've almost forgotten what the word means.

590
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,468
Well, what do you want me to do?
Go over and shake his hand?

591
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,302
Get him out of the valley.

592
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:08,506
I'd almost given up hope of seeing you alive
after what happened last night.

593
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,340
Everyone thinks it's quite funny,
your killing a gunfighter.

594
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,826
The Sheriff isn't even going to arrest you.

595
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:20,181
The jokes on Anchor,
and arresting you would only make it worse.

596
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,580
Only I don't find it funny.
I think the jokes on me.

597
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,470
You promised me you'd stay out of trouble.

598
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:31,300
I think I'm entitled to an explanation.

599
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:34,384
- I had to do it.
- I'm glad to hear that.

600
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:38,388
I'm glad you don't feel obliged
to keep your promise to me.

601
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,861
The one you made that night, that you'd
take anything Mr. Wilkison offered.

602
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,742
No, I don't want to fight.

603
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,501
But I will if it's forced on me.

604
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:51,024
What about me? Don't I count?

605
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,502
We can still get married, we...

606
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,502
Either you sell this place
and we go East, or...

607
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:01,024
I want to know where I stand right now.

608
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,504
Mr. Parrish.

609
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,983
Excuse me, Mr. Parrish.
This is Bud Hinkleman's dad.

610
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,185
Excuse me.

611
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:12,942
He came to get Bud's gear.

612
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,223
- Pleased to meet you.
- Mr. Hinkleman. This is Miss Vail.

613
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,868
- I'm sorry about Bud.
- No call to blame yourself.

614
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,669
We know who's back of all the trouble
in the valley.

615
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,105
Bud always spoke well of you, Mr. Parrish.

616
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,107
Bud was a good, hardworking boy.

617
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:37,183
It's a funny thing, he never could see
working the land like his brothers.

618
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:40,103
Guess a farmer's life
looked kind of dull to him.

619
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:44,549
I reckon herding cattle is as honest a way
of making a living as any other.

620
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,461
But some farmers I know wouldn't agree...

621
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,905
having had their share of troubles
with cattlemen.

622
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,629
I won't keep you any longer, Mr. Parrish.

623
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,029
Mr. Hinkleman...

624
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,782
this belonged to Bud.

625
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,865
I took the liberty of borrowing it.

626
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,868
I remember he saved up to buy it.

627
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,544
He was bound to have
one of them new Colt guns.

628
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,106
You keep it, Mr. Parrish.
I know Bud would want you to.

629
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,704
Well, thank you.

630
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,226
You see, Mr. Parrish, we're farmers.
We're not used to violence.

631
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,498
I'm hardly a professional gunman myself.

632
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,466
I'm not even much of a cattleman.

633
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,065
I can't talk for the rest of the farmers.

634
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:31,302
I want you to know, if the time comes
when you need a few extra men with guns...

635
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,022
I got two sons left.

636
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,941
I hope that won't be necessary.
But I'll remember.

637
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,939
Goodbye, Miss Vail.

638
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,941
You've lied to me for three years.

639
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:58,102
You led me to believe
that I was all that mattered to you.

640
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,185
I'm sorry.

641
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,661
But it's not as simple as all that.

642
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:08,299
I believed what you told me,
that's how simple I was.

643
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,539
Get all the men together. We're moving out.

644
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,182
All right, let's move out.

645
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,949
Take your positions.

646
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:38,910
What makes you so sure
they're going to hit us tonight?

647
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,059
They will.

648
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,345
I still think it's a mistake...

649
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,507
leaving the ranch, which is
as good as a fort, and fighting in the open.

650
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,028
And splitting up the men,
we're bound to be outnumbered.

651
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:54,023
- Never meet the enemy on his terms.
- I sure hope you know what you're doing.

652
00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,663
There they are.

653
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,901
They're riding in on the ranch
like you said they would.

654
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,462
What are they up to?

655
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,425
You want to go down and ask them?

656
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,742
They're burning the ranch.

657
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:00,260
What did you expect them to do?
Give it a fresh coat of paint?

658
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:05,949
You knew they'd burn the ranch,
and yet you had us pull out?

659
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,304
That's right.

660
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,148
Wilkison controls the law here.

661
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,505
You give him any excuse,
he'll have us declared outlaws.

662
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:16,503
Nobody can blame us for what we do
to nightriders burning our ranch.

663
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,587
How do you know they'll come this way?

664
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,979
They'll think we abandoned it.
They'll be off guard.

665
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,504
They're bound to take
the shortest way home.

666
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,505
It's a funny thing, when you work a place,
you sort of become part of it.

667
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,058
You feel for the land,
everything that happens to it.

668
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,345
When it rains, or when it dries up...

669
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:38,582
when things get to die on it or grow on it,
you feel like it's happening to you.

670
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:46,508
Dryer, tell the men to follow my instructions
and be sure to wait for my signal.

671
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:47,659
Right.

672
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:57,739
The Anchormen are on their way.
Wait for Mr. Parrish's signal.

673
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,422
- How many men did you lose?
- Eight.

674
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,941
You were going to get him out of the valley.

675
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:53,986
Lew, why do you always quarrel with Cole?

676
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,981
Your real concern should be Parrish.

677
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:59,028
I'm beginning to think
I was all wrong about Parrish.

678
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:02,468
I don't like to make
that bad a mistake about a man.

679
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,307
He let his ranch go up in smoke
just to set up an ambush.

680
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:09,982
There's a fine cold-blooded devil.

681
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,018
I didn't know he had that much iron in him.

682
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:15,386
How can you talk
so tolerantly about Parrish?

683
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:18,109
I don't see how we can criticise
a man's way of fighting...

684
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,987
after the company we've been keeping.

685
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,059
Meaning me.

686
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:24,267
Cole was following out your orders
of driving Parrish out of the valley.

687
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,023
I didn't tell him to start another range war.

688
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:32,222
He's put every nester on the side of Parrish.
They'll all stand together now.

689
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:36,508
You did exactly the same thing 12 years ago
when you tried to force Purdue out.

690
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:39,787
You didn't accomplish any more than Cole.
At least he...

691
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,625
At least he's got the use of his legs?

692
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,386
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

693
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,383
Only, that's true.

694
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,862
You ran that war.

695
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,861
Look at your souvenirs.

696
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,623
Get out of here.

697
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,183
I said, get out!

698
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:02,549
I believe I have something to say
about all this.

699
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:06,299
We started something that we have to finish.
There's no turning back.

700
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,182
We need Cole more than ever.

701
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,148
You don't need him here, Father.
You never did.

702
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:12,505
Judith.

703
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:17,101
You can run Anchor yourself.
Please send him away. Don't listen to her.

704
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,146
Judith, dear, you don't understand.

705
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:22,506
- I want your Uncle Cole here because...
- I know why you want him here.

706
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:23,943
Do you, Judith?

707
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:27,542
- Do you really know?
- Yes, Mother, I know.

708
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:31,388
Well, then you should understand
what I'm trying to do.

709
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:35,304
You know how much I love your father
and how much I want his happiness.

710
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:38,024
I wouldn't do anything to hurt him.

711
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:40,259
Father...

712
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:44,821
After the way you've kept to yourself,
you have no right to tell us anything.

713
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,581
If it's so hard to make you understand...

714
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,389
I don't wonder Judith behaves
the way she does.

715
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,544
I've tried to make a home
for you and Judith.

716
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,901
The kind of home
people of our standing should have.

717
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,345
I've tried to do what is best
for Anchor and the family.

718
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,261
Didn't matter what happened to me.

719
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:18,103
All I wanted was your happiness,
and Judith's.

720
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:20,380
But I've reached the end of my endurance.

721
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:23,030
You do whatever you think is best
from now on.

722
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,103
I want to know
how Cole is going to get Parrish.

723
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,542
Parrish is cavalry-trained.

724
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,821
He's got a couple of old hands with him
who'll fight us to the end.

725
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:40,140
Nobody's catching him and his men
in the mess of canyons...

726
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,107
unless they want to get caught.

727
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:44,944
Another ambush would just about finish us.

728
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:48,898
The men here ride for money.
They're not used to taking punishment.

729
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:51,348
Any one of them gets shot up...

730
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,627
the whole lot will saddle up
and light out of here in a hurry.

731
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:55,859
Well, let them.

732
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,784
We'll hire others. It won't stop us.

733
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,545
It didn't stop you when you fought your way
into a valley crawling with Indians.

734
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:05,019
You didn't let anything
stand in your way then.

735
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:07,539
You didn't build Anchor
by depending on others.

736
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,063
You fought and struggled.

737
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:11,943
It's weight, strength, and endurance
that count. And purpose.

738
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:15,989
To know what you want, and never
to allow anyone or anything to stop you.

739
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:20,946
I didn't think you'd allow Parrish
to stop you.

740
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,182
Nobody's stopping me.

741
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,342
I promised you the valley.

742
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,863
Anybody following her?

743
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,661
I came here alone, Mr. Parrish.

744
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,908
You don't have to fight Anchor,
there's no reason to.

745
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:39,624
My father made a mistake
offering you so little.

746
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,382
I know he'll give you what you want.

747
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,109
What about Bud Hinkleman?
Can he give him back his life?

748
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,545
My father had nothing to do with that.

749
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,867
He had my ranch burned to the ground.

750
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:52,545
What happened to your ranch
wasn't my father's idea. It was Cole's.

751
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,706
My father is a crippled old man.

752
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:57,987
He's had a long time to brood over
what's happened to him in this valley.

753
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,460
Most of the people he hated are gone now.
There's no reason for him to fight.

754
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:04,428
I don't understand
what you're trying to do, Miss Wilkison.

755
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:07,468
All I'm trying to do
is to stop this useless killing.

756
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:10,702
I saw what it did to my father and the others
the last time they fought.

757
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,907
I saw it as a child, when they brought
in the men, bleeding and dying.

758
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:17,665
And my father, he kept screaming he'd
sooner die than be a cripple all his life...

759
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,820
while they kept digging the bullets
out of his legs.

760
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:22,708
I don't believe it has to be that way,
to kill and be killed.

761
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,542
We're losing time, Captain.

762
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:33,625
Keep Miss Wilkison here until morning.

763
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,099
I'm sorry.

764
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:39,102
I didn't come here for your sympathy.
Don't waste it on me.

765
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:40,862
You don't owe me a thing.

766
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:06,268
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to Dallas.

767
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:07,783
But why?

768
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:09,622
How long do you think we can keep this up?

769
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,507
- Your daughter.
- She doesn't know anything.

770
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,023
If she did, she'd never tell Lew.

771
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,509
That's not the reason you're leaving.

772
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,501
All right, you want the truth? I'll tell you.

773
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:20,026
I'm leaving because there's nothing
in this for me. I'm no hired gun hand.

774
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:23,028
You brought me here to run Anchor,
only Lew's still running it.

775
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:26,022
He just thinks he is. You know
you can do whatever you want to here.

776
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:29,147
Sure, until I get rid of Parrish
and the rest of them.

777
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,949
Then Lew's going to kick me out of here,
the way he did before.

778
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:35,022
- Not this time. I won't let him.
- Sure you will.

779
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,549
Once you get what you want, the valley.
That's the only reason you want me here.

780
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:42,508
- lf Lew could hold it for you...
- How can you say such a thing?

781
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,467
You know how much I need you.

782
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:48,539
You don't need anybody.
You never have, you never will.

783
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:54,180
- But I do need you. I love you.
- You said that 20 years ago.

784
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:57,219
Only you took Lew instead
because he had a ranch.

785
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,540
I loved you,
but you let him take what he wanted.

786
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:00,858
You went easy.

787
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:04,260
I made a mistake, but I've paid for it.
But the past is past.

788
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:08,980
We have to think of our future together.
Cole, I love you.

789
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:11,425
- Prove it.
- How? Tell me how.

790
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:15,059
All right, I'll forget about Elena.
You come to Dallas with me.

791
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:19,265
- I can't.
- What's stopping you?

792
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,230
Well, I'm not free. I have to think of Judith.

793
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:26,383
You mean, you won't give up
what you really want, the rest of the valley?

794
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:30,179
- That's not true. I want you.
- You can't have both. What'll it be?

795
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:33,706
- Cole, be sensible.
- I am. I'm leaving with Elena.

796
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:36,226
All she wants is me.

797
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,226
De Rosa is waiting for us
to pull the Anchor men away from the ranch.

798
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:11,778
We'll stampede the horses.
McCloud, you start the cattle going.

799
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:57,948
Martha, where were you?

800
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:00,743
I couldn't sleep.

801
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:03,583
Neither could I.

802
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:08,866
- What's troubling you?
- Nothing. Why do you ask?

803
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:12,424
Mr. Wilkison. Stampede!

804
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,828
- Yes?
- Stampede. Parrish set them off.

805
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:33,549
Stop them before they run themselves
into the canyon.

806
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,586
- Get all the men.
- Yes, sir.

807
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:40,185
You in the bunk house, get up out of there!

808
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,023
Stampede. Get up out of there!

809
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:44,987
- Get Cole.
- He isn't here. He left.

810
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,583
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

811
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,820
- I said he could stay.
- He didn't want to.

812
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,060
- Where did he go?
- What's the difference? He's gone.

813
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,584
Now you'll have to fight Parrish all alone.

814
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:28,148
Remember Mr. Parrish's orders.
Burn them out.

815
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:16,979
Get downstairs.

816
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:24,467
- Wake Judith.
- She's not in her room.

817
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:27,587
- Where is she?
- I don't know. She's been gone all day.

818
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:38,302
Martha. The crutches.

819
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:10,904
Come here.

820
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:15,027
- Cole, my new dress.
- I'll get you another one in Dallas.

821
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:22,461
- Get her out of here.
- Don't start that again.

822
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,188
Cole, tell her please to go.

823
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,022
I said get her out of here.

824
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:29,546
- Sorry, she belongs here.
- Lew is dead.

825
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:39,748
Leave us alone awhile.

826
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:46,868
I'll see you later.

827
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:52,948
- How did it happen?
- Parrish set fire to Anchor.

828
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:57,149
We'll have to rebuild everything. Together.

829
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:02,349
- How did Lew get killed?
- What does it matter how? He's dead.

830
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:05,425
There's no need to be jealous anymore.

831
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:42,025
Father.

832
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,829
Where's Mother?

833
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:35,229
- Is she...
- She's all right.

834
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,818
How do you know?

835
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:42,502
- She managed to get out of the house.
- Without you?

836
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:47,658
I was in my room asleep.

837
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:51,266
By the time I got to the stairs...

838
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,944
Where was she
that she couldn't reach you in time?

839
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:58,669
- I don't know.
- I believe you do, Father.

840
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,978
- I'll take you into Logasa.
- No.

841
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:09,423
Your mother will be there with Cole.

842
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,342
But Mrs. Wilkison...

843
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:20,467
I can't swear in no gun hands
to help you clear out the valley...

844
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:23,348
unless I got legal cause to deputise them.

845
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:27,299
- Being sheriff, I'm supposed to keep the law.
- For Anchor.

846
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,823
It ain't that I don't want to do like you say.

847
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,418
But no judge or jury would sit still for it.

848
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,900
I'll hang Parrish and his bunch all right...

849
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:41,224
but as long as Purdue and the nesters
had no part in...

850
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,663
But they did.

851
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:47,979
All the hands said it was only Parrish
and his outfit that did it.

852
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:50,779
Course, if I had a witness.

853
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:53,583
I saw them.

854
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:58,384
It's difficult for me to talk about it.

855
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:03,069
I'm sorry, ma'am.

856
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,981
We'll get them, Mrs. Wilkison.

857
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:09,661
We'll string them up so high...

858
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,947
The terrible part is
these people were my neighbours.

859
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:17,658
Now they have no part here
with the rest of us. None of them do.

860
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,218
Any judge or jury will go along on that.

861
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,944
I dread to think
what may have happened to Judith.

862
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,941
I haven't seen her
since yesterday afternoon.

863
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:27,908
- lf they've harmed her...
- I'll find out soon enough.

864
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:29,225
Sheriff...

865
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,259
my husband was a man of great vision.

866
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,704
He knew someday
this territory would be a state.

867
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:42,782
And its affairs would be run
by men with ambition.

868
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:47,149
Lew is gone,
but I know he wouldn't want me to stop.

869
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:51,585
He said it's people like us who would
make this country what it should be.

870
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:52,944
People who don't give in.

871
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:56,420
People who keep on fighting
no matter what they feel or suffer.

872
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:01,427
Cole and I are going to rebuild Anchor
bigger than ever.

873
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:04,061
I'll be greatly indebted to anyone...

874
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,222
who helps me make it a fitting memorial
to my husband.

875
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:09,987
I understand, Mrs. Wilkison.

876
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:23,905
You men have been deputised
to help me keep law and order.

877
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:28,866
That means getting rid of Parrish
and every one of them murdering outlaws.

878
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:32,659
I want this valley to be a decent,
respectable place to live in.

879
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:36,665
Cole Wilkison, my Chief Deputy,
has got something to say to you.

880
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:39,262
Parrish murdered my brother.

881
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:42,384
Burned him alive.
Purdue and the nesters helped him.

882
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,665
They got no protection coming from the law.

883
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:49,346
There's $100 for each of you men to help us
clear the valley of the nesters and farmers.

884
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:52,099
Burn them out, string them up,
smash them, shoot them.

885
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,624
Do what you want, only get rid of them.

886
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:57,065
Mrs. Wilkison is offering a $1,000 reward...

887
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:00,301
to whoever brings Parrish in dead or alive.

888
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,303
Cole, wait.

889
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:21,021
Cole, will you listen to me?
Don't go, please.

890
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,983
What do you want?

891
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:53,024
<i>Señora,</i> I have come to beg you.

892
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:56,743
If it's about Cole, there's nothing to discuss.

893
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:58,502
Leave us alone, please.

894
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:03,106
You have a family, much land, everything.
I have nothing but Cole.

895
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,941
I love him. He is all I want.

896
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:09,660
Do not take him away from me
when you do not love him.

897
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,548
Please, <i>señora,</i>
let him go back with me to Dallas.

898
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:17,101
You can bring him no happiness.

899
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:26,904
How much?

900
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,821
I did not come here for...

901
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:33,947
How much to get you on that stagecoach
to Dallas?

902
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:37,542
You think everyone is like you,
loves only money.

903
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,941
I know your kind. So does Cole.

904
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:42,384
Get out.

905
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:36,101
I hope I did right, sending for you.

906
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:39,899
Mr. Wilkison was near dead when
the girl brought him. I couldn't turn him out.

907
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,343
Come, Bill.

908
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:50,070
You must have enjoyed
watching Anchor burn.

909
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:54,507
It was my home. I was born, I grew up there.
And there's nothing left of it now.

910
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:59,222
I hear the sheriff at Logasa
has sworn a small army of deputies.

911
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,425
Put them under Cole's command.

912
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:01,905
Deputies?

913
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:05,346
They're nothing but a bunch of hired killers,
murdering for money.

914
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:08,308
I'm holding you and your daughter
as hostages to prevent more bloodshed.

915
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:10,301
Go ahead, take me into the hills.

916
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,858
Saddle yourself with a crippled old man.

917
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:16,706
What you don't know
is that my wife and brother want me dead.

918
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:20,066
A man makes many mistakes in his life...

919
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:23,142
but most as he grows old
and sees time running short.

920
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:27,428
Gets in too big a hurry to get things done,
loses sight of what's going on around him.

921
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:31,901
I was always on the lookout for somebody
outside Anchor to break down its walls.

922
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:36,785
I didn't know when it happened,
it would be from the inside.

923
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:40,540
Cole and his men
just smashed up the Purdue place.

924
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:43,622
They killed another of his boys
and are after the hands and nesters.

925
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:45,462
They aim to destroy the whole valley.

926
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:46,665
You'll have to get out of here.

927
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,308
They're not chasing me off my land.

928
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,585
- Don't argue.
- I'm not arguing. I've lost one son...

929
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:53,389
You'll lose the rest of them
if you make a stand here.

930
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:57,145
You said once that if ever I needed
any extra guns, I could count on you.

931
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,424
I need them now.

932
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:00,341
- What do you want me to do?
- Get on over to my camp.

933
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,227
We must get the farmers to fight with us.

934
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:04,824
What will happen to my father
if they come here?

935
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,468
Take them with you.

936
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:19,266
Cole Wilkison is burning out the valley.
Get out while you can.

937
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:01,220
Evening, Mrs. Wilkison.
Welcome back to Anchor, what's left of it.

938
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:03,426
- Have you seen anything of my daughter?
- Not yet.

939
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:05,865
- Where's Cole?
- Up at the bunkhouse.

940
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,059
Giddap.

941
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,670
- I've been waiting for you.
- I got here as soon as I could.

942
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,741
- What about Parrish?
- Forget him for tonight.

943
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:36,503
I can't. We'll never have any peace
as long as he's alive.

944
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,663
- He won't be after tomorrow.
- Then there'll be nothing to stop me.

945
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:43,384
What about me? Where do I fit in?

946
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,668
If I have Anchor, so will you.

947
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:53,020
Magruder and Cole are up at the ranch with
their men getting ready to hit us at sunrise.

948
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:55,664
- We'll hit them before they hit us.
- No.

949
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:59,789
- Let Cole have the valley.
- We're not handing it over to him.

950
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:03,704
- You know it's hopeless. He has many men.
- That doesn't make any difference.

951
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:05,468
No difference? Why not?

952
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:07,740
It doesn't make any difference
when a fight's forced on you.

953
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,788
But why die for a piece of land
when there's so much of it?

954
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,349
We're not running.

955
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,784
That's right. Find an excuse
to stay here and fight.

956
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,940
Men can always find a reason
to murder each other.

957
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:21,500
I know you think you're doing right.
But there's no right to killing.

958
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,342
I'd like to know what good it's ever done.

959
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:24,829
It's only brought on more killing.

960
01:26:24,910 --> 01:26:28,789
It made a cripple out of my father.
It took your son, and yours.

961
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:30,982
Must you lose the others, too?

962
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:34,380
Must every one of you die
before the slaughter stops?

963
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,708
You men who are always ready with a knife
or a gun or your fists...

964
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:38,905
what are you trying to prove?

965
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:42,027
That you're as brave as the next man?
That you can die as well as he can?

966
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:43,828
Why don't you try to live for a change?

967
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:45,179
Judith.

968
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:47,506
Don't you tell me anything. You're no better.

969
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:49,501
When I think of the men you've killed,
and for what?

970
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:52,582
To make Anchor
the biggest cemetery in the country!

971
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:03,144
I'm going to get Cole. Without him,
those hired gun-hands won't fight.

972
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,547
I'm going with you, Captain.

973
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,870
I'm going, too. I'm not leaving him.

974
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,583
What about the rest of us?

975
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:15,742
I said I'd stand with any man
who didn't run from Anchor.

976
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,983
You may still have to fight
if I don't come back.

977
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:31,218
Magruder.

978
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:43,748
She told me that he was dead.

979
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:47,739
Magruder.

980
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,425
- Who hired these men?
- Your brother.

981
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,029
Who's going to pay them?

982
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:55,499
Mr. Wilkison, I thought I was doing
what was right.

983
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:57,945
They told me that Parrish had killed you.

984
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:00,548
Get them off my place.

985
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:03,098
Cole hired you to do his killing,
to clean out the valley.

986
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:04,225
What about our money?

987
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:07,222
You'll get your money.
But there will be no more killing.

988
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:11,189
Now get off my property, all of you.
You're trespassing.

989
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,743
Go on, get off!

990
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:13,658
Mr. Parrish.

991
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,943
- My father would like to speak with you.
- What for?

992
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:24,223
He'd like you to come to Anchor
and run it for him.

993
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:30,427
I have my own place to rebuild.
Thanks a lot for the offer, anyway.

994
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:03,459
You know, your father once told me
he'd get my ranch, one way or another.
