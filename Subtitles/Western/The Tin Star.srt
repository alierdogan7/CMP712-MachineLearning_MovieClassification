1
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,195
Just getting the feel of these guns.

2
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,969
Where's the sheriff?

3
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,140
Sheriff?

4
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,582
- What's wrong, Mr. King?
- Who's that man?

5
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,019
I don't know.

6
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,660
Hickman. Morgan Hickman.

7
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,729
Better take his gun,
he's killed someone.

8
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,758
You won't need to take my gun.

9
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,826
Won't need this anymore either.

10
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,868
"Luke Jameson, murder and robbery.
$500 reward."

11
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,806
- A bounty hunter.
- Yep.

12
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,845
I tracked down Jameson.
He tried to shoot it out.

13
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,974
A fair fight. You won't find
any bullet holes in his back.

14
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,121
Don't like outlaws brought in dead?

15
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,959
Our officers bring in
their prisoners alive.

16
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,096
Your officer didn't bring in
Jameson at all.

17
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,330
I'm not the law.
I work inside it for money.

18
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,529
Same as you do
if you're in a legal business.

19
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,234
I believe the banking business is legal.
I'm also mayor.

20
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,877
My friends are businessmen,

21
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,606
except for Judge Thatcher
and Dr. McCord.

22
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,376
You got a bone to pick
with a freight company.

23
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,951
They put a hunk of money
on Jameson's head.

24
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,055
He robbed the freight office,
killed the agent.

25
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:29,126
Wanted him dead or alive,
which is kind of a hint, sounds like.

26
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,162
We're not here to argue.
This is a law-and-order town.

27
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,699
- Collect your money and get out.
- Suits me fine.

28
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,632
- How soon can I collect?
- Soon as I can manage it.

29
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,302
I gotta mail in your claim, and I can't
take your word it's Jameson.

30
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,171
I wouldn't know him from Adam.

31
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,372
There's one man in town ought to
recognize the corpse. Bart Bogardus.

32
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:55,078
- Jameson's his cousin. Or was.
- Get an affidavit from Bogardus.

33
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:59,315
I'll have to sign the claim, so will you.
When will it be ready?

34
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,824
First thing tomorrow morning.

35
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,988
You can unload my packhorse, sheriff.
I gotta find me a place to stay.

36
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,591
I'd like a room.

37
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,600
Haven't got a room.

38
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,770
Maybe you can find me one.

39
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,969
I said, I haven't got a room.

40
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,715
Any other hotel in town?

41
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,477
Nope.

42
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,550
Where can I put up my horses?

43
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,047
Livery barn's that way.

44
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,955
Can't miss it on your way out of town.

45
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,775
Now, don't be scared,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

46
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,681
I'm gonna take you home.
Got a real nice coop.

47
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,448
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

48
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,924
- What are you up to, son?
- Catching pigeons.

49
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,426
Get out of that hayloft!

50
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,391
Ain't I warned you to keep out?
Now get out of here and stay out.

51
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,902
I don't want your kind around here.

52
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,502
- What do you want?
- Put up my horses.

53
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,512
- You know who I am?
- I didn't ask.

54
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,151
Bogardus is the name.
Bart Bogardus.

55
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,786
Jameson was kin of mine.

56
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,215
Well, every family's
got one black sheep.

57
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,987
- Some of them got two.
- Take your horses and get out.

58
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,129
It's your barn.

59
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,477
Hey, mister, can I ride your horse?

60
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,953
Big enough to get on, are you?

61
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,332
Better get off.
It's a long walk back.

62
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,172
- I live here.
- Where?

63
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,141
- Kip, where have you been?
- The barn.

64
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,185
- You promised to keep out of there.
- I ain't afraid.

65
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,380
Well, I am.
Thanks for fetching him home.

66
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,327
Wouldn't know anyplace a man
could put up, would you?

67
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, you'd have to share
a bedroom with my son.

68
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,195
- I don't mind if he don't.
- I don't mind. Come on.

69
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,069
More coffee?

70
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,170
If you don't mind.

71
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,968
Get up, Kip. You've finished.

72
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,171
- You live here all alone?
- I have my son.

73
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,285
Why don't you live with us.
Then I can ride your horse.

74
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,750
Kip.

75
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,482
Fact is, I would like to stay,
if your mother would put up with me.

76
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,149
She'd be glad. Wouldn't you, Mom?

77
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,761
If Mr. Hickman wishes to stay,
he can stay.

78
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,295
You wanna see my pigeons?

79
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,626
Not tonight.
Don't bother Mr. Hickman.

80
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,099
I just asked. I catched them
in the livery barn.

81
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,167
- You have enough pigeons.
- No, I haven't.

82
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,041
I'm raising them.
Two have laid eggs already.

83
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,406
- You wanna see my pigeons?
- Be quiet.

84
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,380
- I better look at my horses.
- I'll go with you.

85
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,616
I hope you don't mind.

86
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,615
Bet he shows me his pigeons.

87
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,926
Wanna see my pigeons?

88
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,991
Lead away, captain.

89
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,611
- Can you see them?
- What are you gonna do with them?

90
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,907
When I raise enough,
I'm gonna sell them and buy a horse.

91
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,907
Maybe a dog too.

92
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:29,046
- Take a long while, won't it?
- Yeah, but I'll do it.

93
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,325
- Mom?
- You go to sleep now.

94
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,767
Nice boy you got.

95
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,001
Well, I hope he doesn't pester
you with all his talking.

96
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,079
- I like kids.
- They like you.

97
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,620
I had a boy once.

98
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,256
You lost him?

99
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,960
Him and my wife both. Same time.

100
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,776
I guess what got me
remembering was...

101
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,946
...watching you make your own dress.

102
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,117
I used to sit and watch her
the same way.

103
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,582
It was nice.

104
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,682
This isn't mine.
It's for a lady in town.

105
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,987
The way you make your living?

106
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,460
When I can find the work.

107
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,337
Well, I'm afraid that's all for tonight.

108
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,308
Getting late.

109
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,644
- Say, am I keeping you up?
- Oh, no, no.

110
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,649
I'm gonna sleep out here
on the bunk.

111
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,117
You can go to bed anytime.

112
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,223
I don't like to take your bed.
Why don't you let me bunk here?

113
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,054
Because I'll be up before you.

114
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,992
You'll need a light to find
your way in the bedroom.

115
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,963
- I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
- Nona Mayfield.

116
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,070
Mayfield?

117
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,065
You heard my name
mentioned in town?

118
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,765
No, but...

119
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,941
Mayfield, I mean...

120
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,170
Your boy looks part Mexican.

121
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:40,582
- I got nothing against Mexicans.
- Well, how about lndians?

122
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,519
Kip's father was an lndian.

123
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,487
Very well, you can move out
in the morning.

124
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,898
There's no use arguing, Ben.

125
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:32,003
You told me when you took that badge
it was gonna be only temporary.

126
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,239
Look, Millie, I guess
I might as well tell you.

127
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,705
What I'm hoping for, if...

128
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,778
Well, if I can show them,
if I can make good...

129
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,210
You'll make good.
In the graveyard.

130
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,245
What do you want, Ben,
me or that badge?

131
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,651
- I can't quit until they want me to.
- I won't be around.

132
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,624
Oh, well. Morning, Millie.

133
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,756
What's the trouble?

134
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,899
She wants me to give up my badge.
How do you like that?

135
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,232
Well, Millie,
that's your papa's badge.

136
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,996
We'd hate to see
it on any man

137
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,039
who didn't keep it clean
and bright like he did.

138
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,539
As for Ben here, young as he is,
he's the only one we could find.

139
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,113
Would you rather see it
pinned on Bogardus?

140
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,545
I don't care.

141
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,153
I only know there's not gonna be
any tin star in my life, never.

142
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,359
Where would you be
if your mama had said that?

143
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,823
I saw what Mother went through,

144
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,954
never knowing what was gonna
happen. Well, finally it did happen.

145
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,427
I'm gonna be a wife, not a widow.

146
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,930
I read something once,
sticks in my mind:

147
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:45,668
"From this nettle, danger,
we pluck this flower, safety."

148
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,744
Your father plucked that flower.

149
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:51,610
Folks felt safe to raise their babies,
not be afraid.

150
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,117
But somebody had to walk
through the nettle patch.

151
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,545
Let someone else do it.

152
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,985
So nobody does it.

153
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,150
That's how the wrong men
get hold of things.

154
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,157
Well, here's a man walks
through the nettle patch,

155
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,197
takes all the flowers for himself.

156
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:12,565
- I have no use for bounty hunters.
- Well, that makes it unanimous.

157
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,901
Miss Parker's father
was sheriff here for 20 years.

158
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,067
If you find it too chilly in here,
you can wait outside.

159
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,337
I don't mind the chill,
I'm after money.

160
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,141
Oh, that reminds me.

161
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,978
The coroner's certificate,
my formal affidavit

162
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,748
that Jameson died suddenly,
but thoroughly, of one gunshot.

163
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,392
Well, I'm riding out
to look at a bird's nest.

164
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,085
Abe Pickett's already got 1 1 kids.
All girls.

165
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,958
Now his Annie is as big
as a barrel again.

166
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,091
There's the kind of woman, Millie,
to build up this country.

167
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,694
Stay here and witness our signatures.

168
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,499
My claim ready?

169
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,234
Yeah, you can sign it.

170
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,552
No good unless you sign it too.

171
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,178
You don't have to tell me my job.
I've gotta check it over first.

172
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,726
I'll just wait,
make sure it's signed right.

173
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,576
You sign my claim yet?
Did he sign it?

174
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,546
- It's Bogardus, he'll kill you.
- Let go.

175
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,686
What are you up to, Ben?

176
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,952
- I gotta arrest you, Bogardus.
- You're not gonna arrest nobody.

177
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,426
- Gotta do what the law says.
- A man's gotta defend hisself.

178
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,428
That half-breed had it coming.

179
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,329
Now, that's far enough. Hold it.

180
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,633
Now, let's talk this thing over.

181
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,842
- I gotta take your guns first.
- First you listen to me.

182
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,846
I drawed in self-defense.
I got witnesses.

183
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:41,008
Even if I didn't, no sheriff's
gonna disarm no white man

184
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,120
for shooting a mangy lndian.

185
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,418
You an lndian lover?

186
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,728
- I know what I gotta do...
- Hold it!

187
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,529
Now, don't try that again.

188
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,729
Go inside, I'll buy you a drink,

189
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,929
and we'll talk this over
like two growed-up men.

190
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,771
Hey, witnesses.

191
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:12,342
- Sheriff's trying to shoot me.
- No, I just want your guns, that's all.

192
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,954
Nobody pulls a gun
without he means to kill.

193
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,249
Everyone in the street
can see what you're up to.

194
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,485
Now, just take it easy,
and I'll go with you.

195
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,133
You made a mistake pulling that gun
on a man like me.

196
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,336
There was no reason
in the world to do it.

197
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,405
I don't like having no one
lay a gun on me.

198
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:47,579
No, sir.
Hadn't ought to done it, Ben.

199
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,211
Why, there ain't a man in town
lay a finger on me if I was to--

200
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,534
Excuse me for butting in, sheriff,
but you forgot to sign my claim.

201
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,834
- Lock him up.
- Give me that hat!

202
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,837
Get going.

203
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,029
- I ain't had a chance to thank you.
- Sign my claim.

204
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,691
If it hadn't been for you...

205
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,861
I'm just looking out
for my reward money, is all.

206
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,472
Yeah.

207
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,067
If I had seen him pulling that gun
from back of his hat,

208
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,076
I'd have triggered him, I think.

209
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,775
- Ben, you almost got killed.
- Would have been a big mistake.

210
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,150
- What did I do wrong?
- Everything.

211
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,552
You listened to what he was saying
instead of seeing what he was doing.

212
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,252
- You pulled your gun too early.
- No, he'd have pulled his first.

213
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,591
You walk right up to a man,
chances are he won't gunfight.

214
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,962
Because at 3 feet, he knows
he'll get hurt, maybe killed,

215
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,330
even if he draws first.

216
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:16,600
Pulling your gun, you just goaded him
into trying to get you.

217
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,903
You better take off that tin star
and stay alive.

218
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,813
- Do you hear that, Ben?
- Look, Millie, I ain't gonna quit.

219
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:35,019
Woman's strongest argument:
Bang the door.

220
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,827
She's right, though. She knows
what's wrong with that badge.

221
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,432
Man pins it on,
he can't take it off.

222
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,166
They'll give you a nice funeral.

223
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,570
See my claim gets off, will you?

224
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,937
I wouldn't expect no bounty hunter
to appreciate this badge.

225
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,640
I wore one a lot longer
than you ever will.

226
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,178
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Afternoon.

227
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,184
- I'd like to see Mr. Hickman.
- Come in, Owens.

228
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,062
I... I'd like to talk to you outside.

229
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,063
What's on your mind?

230
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,959
Well, I'd like to talk to you alone.

231
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,106
Nothing you can say to me
she can't hear. What is it?

232
00:22:56,408 --> 00:23:00,310
I... I got a room for you.

233
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,538
Got a room.

234
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,913
Well, I mean, l... I got you
a room at the hotel.

235
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,953
I went to Buck Henderson,

236
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,615
and he's giving you
the best place he's got.

237
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,624
I like it here.

238
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,464
- Anything else on your mind?
- No.

239
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,963
Well, yes. Is it true what you told me,
that you used to be a sheriff like me?

240
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,406
Not like you.

241
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,236
Well... Well, how come you quit?

242
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,742
That's my business.

243
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:40,641
Look, will you come outside?
It's got nothing to do with her.

244
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,389
What's wrong with Morg?

245
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,357
Nothing.

246
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,909
Well?

247
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,841
Well, I'm in trouble.

248
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,951
- Bogardus out of jail?
- Cleared in court. Had witnesses.

249
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,586
You give him his guns back?

250
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,315
Best Judge Thatcher could do was
fine him $50 for resisting arrest.

251
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,762
How long you had that badge?

252
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,661
Since Sheriff Parker got killed.

253
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,961
Nobody else wanted it, huh?

254
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,161
Yeah. Bogardus.

255
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,865
- He wanted it for a shooting license.
- That's how come he didn't get it.

256
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,104
Town don't want prisoners
brought in dead.

257
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,675
Yeah, I know, they only want
sheriffs brought in dead.

258
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:51,682
- How come they picked you?
- Well, I'm only temporary.

259
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,218
You're more temporary than you think.

260
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,354
Yeah.

261
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:03,998
- Well, I guess I got a lot to learn.
- You won't have time to learn.

262
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,735
I would if you'd show me.

263
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,398
- Take off the badge. Quit.
- I can't.

264
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,043
I'll be gone in a few days.

265
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,009
A few days might mean the difference.
It might.

266
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,556
Don't cock your gun
with the ball of your thumb,

267
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,497
it can slip in a gunfight.

268
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,998
Hit the hammer with
the whole joint of your thumb.

269
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,039
Your gun comes out cocked
as you jerk it for action.

270
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,040
There's a lot more to gunfighting
than just shooting at a mark.

271
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,808
You gotta keep cool,
have absolute confidence.

272
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:55,350
You lack confidence.
That's how you let Bogardus stop you.

273
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,283
- Yeah.
- And to have confidence,

274
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,320
you gotta keep a cool head.

275
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,858
Don't take any chances
you don't have to, but wait,

276
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,962
then end the fight with one shot.

277
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,992
- Wait?
- It's that time you wait

278
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,760
that means the difference between
missing a man and killing him.

279
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,428
- I don't wanna kill nobody.
- Then take your guns off.

280
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,439
A man ain't to be shot
without a chance to surrender.

281
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,871
Or make his fight.

282
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,406
As long as you wear that badge,
you gotta walk up,

283
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,142
tell him to throw them up and then
watch which way his hands move.

284
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,616
If they go up,
you got yourself a prisoner.

285
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,119
If they go down, he's dead,
or you are.

286
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,989
A decent man doesn't wanna kill,
but if you shoot, you shoot to kill.

287
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,989
How about hitting them in the arm?

288
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,528
That hokey-pokey gets you killed.

289
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,465
Guys brag about shooting a gun
out of a man's hand.

290
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,867
They're lying. They shot to kill.

291
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,031
- A wounded man can still kill you.
- Well, you did it.

292
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,042
With Bogardus, you hit his gun.

293
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:58,015
That wasn't my fight, that was yours.
I could take a chance.

294
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,312
What if you missed?

295
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,679
He'd have killed you,
or I'd have had to kill him.

296
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,652
Now, try it again.

297
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,352
Trunk's floated out.

298
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,759
- See that snag sticking up there?
- Yeah.

299
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:19,266
Draw fast, but don't snap shoot.
Take that extra split second.

300
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,340
- That was a man, you'd be dead.
- I got more shots.

301
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,506
You're dead.
You're not taking your time.

302
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,117
- I'd be dead if I slowed down.
- I didn't say to slow down.

303
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,580
Be fast when in action.

304
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,347
Be fast with your muscles,
but deliberate here.

305
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,615
Take that second,
pull the trigger once.

306
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,850
That's what counts, the first shot.

307
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,722
Point dead-center, fight's over.

308
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,589
Well, you didn't expect me
to hit it, did you?

309
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,430
Did you?

310
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,898
Let's see you try.

311
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,873
Well, it's kind of far.

312
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,851
That was just a matter of luck.

313
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,379
Who's that?

314
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,876
- Howdy, sheriff.
- Howdy.

315
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:37,575
- What are you shooting at?
- Just a mark. Where you going?

316
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,877
Town. Zeke and me
has run out of groceries.

317
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,919
The McGaffey brothers,
Zeke and Ed.

318
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,752
They got a place
the other side of Red Canyon.

319
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,417
Got some lndian blood,
haven't they?

320
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,520
You notice everything, don't you?

321
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,531
I notice you're wearing
your guns too low.

322
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,059
That's where Sheriff Parker wore his.

323
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,103
Parker's dead.

324
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,176
- How did he get it?
- A stagecoach got held up.

325
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,677
He suspected somebody,
but he wouldn't talk.

326
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,247
Well, one day his horse
came in without him,

327
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,285
and they found his body right here
with a rifle bullet through his head.

328
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,720
- Feel better?
- Yeah. Wanna see?

329
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,384
Tomorrow. More to your job
than handling guns.

330
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,395
There's things in town you gotta learn.

331
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,547
That your second shot of whiskey?

332
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,482
I can hold my liquor.

333
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,818
Sure, gives you more confidence.
Wrong kind of confidence.

334
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,018
Well, look, I'd get laughed at
if I took beer.

335
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,495
See anyone laughing at me?
Do as you please.

336
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,569
What else have I gotta learn?

337
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,467
Stop acting so mean
and surly all the time.

338
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,875
I know why you do it. You figure
it makes you seem older and tougher.

339
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,002
People gotta like a sheriff,

340
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,944
or they'll look the other way
when he needs them.

341
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,847
You think I'm cheating?
How's this for a few drinks?

342
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,818
- Sit down.
- Look, I gotta...

343
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,720
Sit down.

344
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,736
The first thing you should have noticed
is they weren't wearing guns.

345
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,270
Learn what to stay out of.

346
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,739
If you step into a fight,
make sure you're the better man.

347
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,641
Me and the old lady put on
a better fight than that one.

348
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,278
Have you ever been
up against a better man?

349
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,011
If you live long enough,
which isn't likely,

350
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,587
you might be the better man.

351
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,057
I only wanna be good enough
to keep this badge.

352
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,995
Then study men.

353
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,863
Paste this in your hat:
A gun's only a tool.

354
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,800
You can master a gun
if you got the knack.

355
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,168
Harder to learn men.

356
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,383
There's one you're gonna have to lick
before you're through.

357
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,192
Well, let's call it a night.

358
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,190
- See you in the morning.
- Afraid so.

359
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,267
Thanks, Morg.

360
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,463
I'm not sure I'm doing you a favor.

361
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,781
What's keeping Morg?

362
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,090
You've been stalling me for an hour.
Go to bed now.

363
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,718
Can't go to bed till Morg comes.
It's impolite.

364
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,263
I don't think he'll mind.

365
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,803
- Morg!
- Hello.

366
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,166
Look, Morg! I'm a sheriff.

367
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,639
- Your shirttail's hanging out.
- Don't I look like a sheriff?

368
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,711
You look more like the sheriff
than the sheriff does.

369
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,474
- Bed. Come on.
- Can I ride your horse tomorrow?

370
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,276
Sure.

371
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,748
- Hope I haven't kept you up.
- No.

372
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,120
I wanted to talk to you.

373
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,785
I was wrong about you last night.

374
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,189
You sure?

375
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:53,599
Well, maybe I was right last night,
but not today. Not now either.

376
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:58,731
I shouldn't have gotten mad. I'm just
so used to everybody hating lndians.

377
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,837
We're raised that way.

378
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,776
Well, I wasn't.

379
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,484
My father was an lndian agent.
He respected lndians and liked them.

380
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:13,147
So did l. I grew up with some
who were really fine men.

381
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,458
When you grow up hating them,
you don't get rid of it easy.

382
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,223
I know.

383
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,698
They say the only good lndian
is a dead lndian.

384
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:34,870
When they find one with a man's pride
and courage to stand up as an equal...

385
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,915
...they kill him.

386
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,975
And it isn't called murder.

387
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,789
They've just made him
a good lndian.

388
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,052
And it doesn't even end there.

389
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,888
Not when there's a boy to hate
and a woman to take it out on.

390
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,763
It's Kip I'm thinking of.

391
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,964
He's worth fighting for.

392
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,909
How come you've stayed on
in a town like this?

393
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,638
Because of a friend. One friend.

394
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,840
Kip was sick when we got here,
and I didn't have a penny.

395
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:17,977
The doctor saved him. Not only that,
he found this place for us

396
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,125
and got some ladies in town
who wouldn't speak to me

397
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,887
- to let me do their sewing.
- That old fellow, McCord?

398
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,963
Dr. Joe.

399
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,833
I don't care what any of them say.

400
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,634
The more they're against me,
the more I'll stand up for Kip.

401
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,806
Can you understand that?

402
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:42,571
Same with me, only it's not a boy,

403
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,511
it's something inside me,
pride maybe.

404
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,345
When they try to run me out,
I gotta stay.

405
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,147
- How long will you stay?
- Till I'm paid what's owed me.

406
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:58,150
Maybe it'll make things worse for you,
my staying here.

407
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,630
You're welcome as long as you like.

408
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,012
Kip's a lucky boy.

409
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,411
Any of you seen Ben Owens?

410
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,817
There he is,
coming to town with Morg Hickman.

411
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,491
I thought Ben Owens had sense.
He's been out with him four days.

412
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,686
Keep an eye on him.
I'll fetch the mayor.

413
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,593
Sheriff? Ben?

414
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,529
I wanna see you a minute.

415
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,237
Wait for me in my office.

416
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,376
- What's the matter, doc?
- Go inside. I wanna talk to you.

417
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,286
- What happened?
- Keep that in your mouth, Millie.

418
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:39,486
- I told you, Dr. Joe, I don't want to...
- You keep that in your mouth.

419
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,796
- She's running a fever.
- I was merely walking by when he...

420
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,731
Who is the doctor here,
you or me?

421
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,531
Keep that in your mouth
so I can get a reading.

422
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,434
Well...

423
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,710
Know what day tomorrow is?

424
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,245
It's your birthday. It'll be the biggest
birthday you ever had.

425
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,973
The whole town's turning out.

426
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,483
See all the kids you ever delivered,
including me and Millie.

427
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:06,079
Won't mean a thing
if I don't get my birthday present.

428
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,318
What's that?

429
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:13,957
- I want you two to get together.
- So that's what you're up to.

430
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,725
You were a sweet little thing
when you were born.

431
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,835
Now, behave yourself.

432
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:23,039
This big lummox of a sheriff here
was mean as all get-out.

433
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,069
Bit my finger when I spanked him.

434
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:30,110
But he's grown up to be all right.
I wanna see you two McCord babies

435
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,842
get married and raise more babies,
like God intended.

436
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,853
Why don't you marry him?

437
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,214
You know why, and so does he.

438
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,054
He can't run away from responsibility
any more than you can.

439
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,826
- Women.
- She hates this badge, doc.

440
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:55,371
- She wants me to take it off. I won't.
- You will if they take it away from you.

441
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,473
The whole town's stirred up about you
hanging around with that Hickman.

442
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,171
- Every day, you're together, nights too.
- I know what I'm doing.

443
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,974
He's a bounty hunter.
You're a sheriff.

444
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,174
He used to be a sheriff.

445
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:10,080
- Who said so?
- He did. He told me.

446
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,017
You believe him?

447
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,150
Well, he wouldn't lie to me, doc.

448
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,599
Fifty years of my record.

449
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,471
History of the town's
written down here.

450
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,702
Here we are.

451
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:42,750
I won't read the year and the date.
You know it.

452
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:48,916
"Heavy snowfall. Had to go horseback
to get to the Owens' place.

453
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:53,928
"Delivered to Elizabeth Owens,
a healthy 8-and-a-half-pound boy."

454
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,392
Now I'm gonna add
a postscript, as follows:

455
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,594
"Baby grew up to be a good sheriff
with one bad fault.

456
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,467
"He believes everything he's told."

457
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,836
You think he lied to me?

458
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,979
Well, let's just say I'm skeptical.
And Mayor King's no fool.

459
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,810
I want to see you keep that badge.

460
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,886
Thanks, doc.

461
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,071
- Morg, did you lie to me?
- What's that?

462
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,306
You told me you wore a badge once.

463
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,849
- That's right.
- How come you took it off?

464
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,849
None of your business.

465
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,451
I gotta know, Morg.
How come you quit?

466
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,223
- I found out I was a fool.
- You think I'm a fool?

467
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,025
Any man that wears that badge is.

468
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,401
I know why you like it.
Everyone slaps you on the back,

469
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,332
tells you how important you are.

470
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,770
Decent people look up to you,
they're all your friends.

471
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,403
I've seen it before.

472
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:18,179
Sheriff I knew in Kansas years ago
had it bad like you.

473
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,285
Always took his prisoners alive.
Proud of it.

474
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,985
Finally, his wife had a baby, got sick.

475
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:31,660
Doctor said they'd die
if they didn't move to a drier climate.

476
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,331
They had to have a thousand dollars.

477
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,335
So he went to his friend at the bank,

478
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,934
but it seems like money
and friendship didn't mix.

479
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:47,801
He said he was sorry, but this was
business, had to have collateral.

480
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,310
Well, he didn't have collateral.

481
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,675
Already owed money, doctor's bills,
but he had a lot of friends,

482
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,310
businessmen around town.
He figured they'd put up the collateral.

483
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,589
Same story.

484
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,818
And how'd he pay it back
if he quit and moved west?

485
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,427
What did he do?

486
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,528
Well, there was a man wanted.

487
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:16,468
Big reward, dead or alive.
So he went after him.

488
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,342
Took a long time.

489
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,144
Took him a long ways from home,
but he tracked him down.

490
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:28,480
The fellow tried to shoot it out,
so he killed him. Brought him in,

491
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,143
collected the thousand dollars.

492
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,522
By that time,
his wife and baby had died.

493
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,365
Never had much use
for that tin star after that.

494
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,076
Well, here they come.

495
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,179
- You're waiting to collect your reward?
- Right.

496
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:07,154
We telegraphed the freight company.
They authorized the bank to pay it.

497
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,586
Thanks.

498
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,694
You'll have to sign for it.
Better look it over.

499
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,535
Well, I guess
I had collateral this time.

500
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,838
I'd suggest you leave town.

501
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,502
You couldn't pay me
enough money to stay.

502
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,843
Sheriff, we wanna see you.
We'll call a meeting tomorrow.

503
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,076
- Tomorrow's McCord Day.
- Oh, yes.

504
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,186
The day after tomorrow.

505
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,025
I guess doc was right.
They're gonna take my badge.

506
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:47,959
You're lucky.

507
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,664
Well, I don't care what they say.
I'm gonna give them a fight.

508
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:59,072
- Thanks for everything, Morg.
- You know, you look like a sheriff.

509
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,803
Sorry I'm gonna miss
that council meeting.

510
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,268
Me too.

511
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,620
Sheriff! Sheriff!

512
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,098
- What happened?
- Holdup. Shot Johnny Biggers.

513
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,600
Get the doctor. Johnny was
riding shotgun. I got him inside.

514
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,863
- How is he?
- Very bad.

515
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,177
Come on, folks, stand back.
Give him some air.

516
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,774
Here's Doc Joe.

517
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:44,248
- You want us to get him out, doc?
- No, not yet.

518
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:51,787
- Well, where did it happen?
- Other side of Abe Pickett's ranch.

519
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,327
Two men, faces covered.

520
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:57,297
Johnny shot one of them. The other
shot Johnny as we were getting away.

521
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,958
How is he, doc?

522
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,166
He's dead.

523
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,474
Mighty brave man, Johnny Biggers.

524
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,306
If I was sheriff, I'd get two for one.

525
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,752
McCall.

526
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,390
Sloan.

527
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,355
Hardman.

528
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,758
- Three is enough, Ben.
- I want one more.

529
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,955
You got one, sheriff.

530
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,758
Morg?

531
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,639
You lost your sidekick.

532
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,340
Next sheriff's posse, I'll be the boss.

533
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,287
Ben, three of us is enough.
Four, counting you.

534
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:54,652
Jim, show us where they jumped you,
and we'll get started.

535
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,986
Here's the place to pick up their trail.

536
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:01,188
One was hit in the right shoulder.
Dropped his gun when Johnny fired.

537
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,222
Let's go.

538
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,099
Hey, Morg, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

539
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,736
Oh, I had a little business in town.

540
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,375
- What's that?
- That little paint horse?

541
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,679
- Name's Dinky.
- Is he yours?

542
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,583
- Yours.
- Mine?

543
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:34,127
Dinky! Mom, look! I got me a horse!
Look, Mom! I got a real horse!

544
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,690
- Kip, you didn't say thanks.
- His name's Dinky.

545
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,802
My own horse!
Ain't he a beauty, Mom?

546
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:44,937
Wait, Kip! Wait!
Kip, you haven't said thanks.

547
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,708
Oh, he didn't even thank you.

548
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,506
He sure did.
Didn't you see his face?

549
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,907
- You're too generous.
- Don't fool yourself.

550
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,317
A man lives alone like me,
he gets kind of selfish.

551
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,926
He gives you anything, be sure
he's getting his money's worth.

552
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,527
You wanna give me something,
how about coffee?

553
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:06,993
All right.

554
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,270
- Howdy, doc.
- Well, howdy, Ben.

555
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,915
- No luck?
- Well, not yet. One's hit, though.

556
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,314
- We saw some blood a while back.
- Was he wounded bad?

557
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,421
Don't know. Clark said he got
buckshot in the shoulder.

558
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,353
- Where you going?
- Didn't you pass Abe Pickett?

559
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:39,553
- He passed us, going hell for leather.
- He rode into town the same way,

560
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,789
said his Annie had begun to holler.

561
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,399
I know Annie.
Fine, dependable woman.

562
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,536
Helped her bring 1 1 girls.

563
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:50,332
Always starts to holler three,
four hours before her time.

564
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:54,967
That's the kind of wife to have for a
man who lives way out past nowhere.

565
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,340
Be sure you get back
by tomorrow morning.

566
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,881
Don't fear, I'm not gonna miss
my birthday party.

567
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,747
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

568
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,761
Abe?

569
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,670
Abe.

570
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:29,171
- I've been asleep?
- About two hours.

571
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,774
She's here?

572
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,414
I'll read you the record.

573
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:44,082
"2:25 a.m., July 1 6,
my 75th birthday.

574
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,856
"Delivered Annie Pickett
of a 9-pound boy."

575
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:51,431
Boy?

576
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,763
"Annie says she will name him
Joseph Jefferson McCord,

577
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:59,067
"after yours truly, J.J. McCord, M.D."

578
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,507
You sure it ain't just another girl?

579
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:05,671
Well, I hope I'm not too old
to know the difference.

580
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,283
You better get in there
and see for yourself.

581
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,477
Annie! Annie, honey!

582
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,747
Annie?

583
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,255
Annie, honey?

584
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,126
Annie?

585
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,220
Well, Bessie,

586
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,757
you're kind of like Annie Pickett.

587
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,385
A world of patience
with us doggone men.

588
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,562
I'm gonna get some sleep.

589
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,002
You know the way home
better than I do.

590
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,550
Doc!

591
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,712
- Ed McGaffey.
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,291
- Can you come out to our place?
- Who's sick?

593
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,324
My brother, Zeke.

594
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,961
- I'm not sure I know the way.
- Well, just follow me.

595
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:27,450
Get away! Go on, now.

596
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,919
Come on, get out!

597
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,111
Well.

598
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,515
You're hurt bad.

599
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,623
Tell him how it happened, Ed.

600
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,730
We was hunting deer back
in the canyon. Buck jumped up,

601
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,904
and Zeke stepped in between just
as I was pulling the trigger. Sorry.

602
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,541
It was my own fault, Ed.

603
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,613
Hold that lamp closer.

604
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,488
Now, this is gonna hurt, son.

605
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,461
Well, old girl,

606
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,471
you've had your sleep.
My turn now.

607
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,345
Gonna be a fine day.

608
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:35,480
McCord Day.
How do you like that?

609
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,210
McCord Day.

610
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,452
Zeke gonna be all right?

611
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,622
Well, he should have
been treated sooner.

612
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,883
Think he knowed?

613
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,352
He knowed the minute
he laid eyes on you.

614
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,686
No, Ed! Ed, you can't!
No, Ed!

615
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,830
Ed! Don't!

616
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:56,391
Quiet! Quiet, everybody!
Dr. Joe is on his way in!

617
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,659
Hooray!

618
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,669
Remember, Sergeant Plummer will
blow his bugle when it's time to start.

619
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,535
The fiddler will lead the music.
Try and keep time.

620
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:09,668
- Sing loud so Dr. Joe will hear you!
- Hip-hip-hooray!

621
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,838
All right, get ready!
Here he comes!

622
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,468
- Dr. Joe?
- Doc?

623
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:28,786
- Where was he?
- Abe Pickett's.

624
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:33,692
I guess you'll find it here.
He always wrote down all his calls.

625
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,463
- You see it?
- Something else here too.

626
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,430
Here's what he wrote last.

627
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,968
"Ed McGaffey stopped me in the dark.
Said his brother was sick.

628
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:45,938
"Zeke sure was sick.
Gunshot wound, right shoulder.

629
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,940
"Took out load of buckshot."

630
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,310
- Ed McGaffey.
- They killed Jim Biggers too.

631
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,211
I wanna be on this posse.

632
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,682
- You'll get every man.
- Count me in.

633
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,256
All right, sheriff.
Better organize your posse.

634
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,219
You better get home.

635
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,132
We have unquestioned proof
of who killed Dr. Joe.

636
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,610
To make sure of the immediate
capture of Ed and Zeke McGaffey,

637
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,908
the town council
is putting up rewards.

638
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,347
A thousand dollars
on the head of each man.

639
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,077
Dead or alive?

640
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:34,223
- Bring these men in.
- They ain't men, they're breeds.

641
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,554
- That's got nothing to do with it.
- I say they ain't men.

642
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,525
They'll fight and fight dirty,
like all breeds.

643
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:45,464
If rewards ain't for dead or alive,
they'll bring some of us in dead.

644
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,267
All right, dead or alive.

645
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,833
Get your posse together.

646
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:08,951
Sheriff! Hey, sheriff! Let's get going.

647
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,693
I'll give you a word of advice.
That's a tough posse,

648
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,797
and they're mad
and they're too many.

649
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,195
Show them who's boss
or you're in trouble.

650
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:19,858
Well, come on, then.

651
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:21,770
I never hunt with a pack.

652
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:26,907
All right. If you won't join me,
don't fight me. Keep out of it.

653
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,738
Your mayor sees it my way now.

654
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,938
There's a chunk of money
on each head,

655
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,312
dead or alive,
which means dead.

656
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,779
I'm gonna bring them in alive.

657
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,822
You'll never get near with that army.
They'll hear you coming for miles.

658
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,515
Sheriff, let's get going!

659
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:47,094
- Takes one man alone to do this job.
- What are we waiting for?

660
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,891
Come on, men, let's go!

661
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:57,664
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna give you your last lesson.

662
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,660
You think you ought to
hunt him alone?

663
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:07,302
Well, it's safer than
hunting with a pack.

664
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,767
A fellow could get trampled.

665
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,167
- Where's Kip?
- Outside.

666
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,743
- He wasn't there when I came in.
- He wouldn't leave his pony.

667
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,971
Pony wasn't there either.

668
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,979
Kip? Kip?

669
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,313
Kip?

670
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,461
Kip?

671
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,495
Was he here when
the posse come by?

672
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,064
I'm sure he was.

673
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,597
He's playing sheriff again.

674
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:46,298
- He's followed them.
- There'll be shooting. He'll get hurt.

675
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,307
I'll find him.

676
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,845
His horse is too small to follow
that posse. I'll catch him.

677
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,303
Get in there!

678
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,168
- They're not here!
- Not in the barn!

679
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,372
Then burn the place down!

680
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,694
Come on, let's get the McGaffeys!
Come on!

681
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,430
Hey, wait for me!

682
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,166
Where's your posse?

683
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,331
I left them. Don't call them mine,
they follow Bogardus.

684
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:10,445
I told you. Sheriff don't crack down
on the first man disobeys him,

685
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:14,379
- his posse turns into a mob.
- Well, that's what it is, a mob.

686
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,947
Thought you was a man took his time.

687
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,643
I'm looking for a boy.

688
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,822
Yeah, a couple of them.
Name of McGaffey.

689
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,720
- Name's Kip. You seen him?
- No, I ain't seen him.

690
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,795
I'm warning you, Morg.
I don't want them shot.

691
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,592
They're gonna get
what the law says, a fair trial.

692
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:34,099
You lunkhead. I'll collect
those rewards when I get ready.

693
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,205
Now, I don't give three hoots
for the McGaffeys or you.

694
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,432
I'm looking for a boy.

695
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,862
- Thought you was looking for a boy.
- I am.

696
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:13,092
- I'm tracking the horses.
- They're here. So is the boy.

697
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,499
I can handle this.
You're gonna stay here.

698
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,036
Am l?

699
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:45,832
- Somebody's following the dog.
- I'll get him with the rifle.

700
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:27,170
You all right?

701
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,176
- I tried to catch a dog and was shot at.
- Who shot?

702
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,678
I don't know.
Hiding up in the cave.

703
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:46,693
You take my horse. You come on
the sheriff, you stay there.

704
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,516
- Where's the boy?
- Holding the horses.

705
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,256
- Stay and cover me.
- No, you don't.

706
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,483
You can't take them alive.

707
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,794
- I can if you keep out.
- You'll get killed.

708
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,362
Then it'll be your chance.

709
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,964
I guess there's only one way
to teach you.

710
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:36,704
Go ahead.

711
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,466
Ed?

712
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,637
Ed?

713
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,646
This is Ben Owens.
Can you hear me?

714
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:57,187
Now, Ed, don't shoot.

715
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,994
I swear both of you
are gonna get a fair trial.

716
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:09,100
Now, you just put down your guns
because I'm coming up there.

717
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,130
He shot me.

718
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,632
You got a new part
in your hair, that's all.

719
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:44,933
- Bullet bounced off that thick skull.
- Well, he shot me.

720
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:48,371
- Stay here and cover me.
- No, wait.

721
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:51,975
Here, take it, Morg.

722
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:58,045
You're the most pigheaded
law mule I ever run up against.

723
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,765
My name's Hickman, boys.

724
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:55,508
Lot of money on your heads.
I'll collect it either way you like.

725
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:59,114
You ain't collecting nothing.
I got the sheriff, I'll get you.

726
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,108
You didn't get the sheriff.

727
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,274
He's covering me
with his guns, below.

728
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,187
He's covering you in hell.
We seen him drop.

729
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:15,026
Sheriff! Throw a couple of shots!

730
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:18,791
Not this way,
you might hit a cave rat.

731
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:20,229
Or a bounty hunter.

732
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:31,137
You're a bad shot, McGaffey.

733
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,873
Except when you sneak up
on an unarmed old man.

734
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,917
Better throw out your gun.

735
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:24,555
Let them go through, sheriff.
Kip will pick them up.

736
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,725
If you had as much sense
as your horses,

737
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:35,597
you'd throw out your guns
and come out.

738
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,900
I gotta get out of here!
I gotta get out of here.

739
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,042
Zeke! Stay here!

740
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:43,642
Stay! Stay down!

741
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:23,649
Throw out your gun, Zeke.

742
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,744
Well, you took them alive.

743
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,543
Yeah.

744
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,582
Go on.

745
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:38,417
Kip? Oh, Kip!

746
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:42,623
Are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

747
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,092
Take them on into town.

748
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:02,450
Will they let me keep him?

749
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,281
- Sure. He's your dog now.
- Gee, what a day.

750
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,219
We catched two outlaws,
me and Morg did.

751
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,995
- Did they confess they killed Dr. Joe?
- The older one did.

752
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,153
Hope they get hung.

753
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:19,095
I kind of feel sorry
for the younger one, Zeke.

754
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,763
I got a hunch he'll get off.
Do some time, is all.

755
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,275
You're not staying for the trial?

756
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:31,276
Oh, I'll be moving on come morning.

757
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,140
But you can't!

758
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,514
What about the rewards?

759
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,113
- They go to Kip.
- Kip?

760
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:41,846
Sure. He found them.

761
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,658
That's the hard part. The rest is easy.

762
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,124
You had the right idea, Kip.
One-man posse.

763
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:50,798
But you can't do that.
The money's yours. You just can't.

764
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,128
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Give it to Mom.

765
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,202
That's what I thought.

766
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,570
Won't we never see you again?

767
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,309
Can't I go with you?

768
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:13,478
Better stay with your mother.

769
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:16,888
She don't wanna stay here no more.

770
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:45,177
Bogardus.

771
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,515
Looks like there might
be trouble in town tonight.

772
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,124
Ben's got the McGaffeys locked up.

773
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,625
Yeah. That's just the trouble.

774
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,753
Bart! Hey, Bart!

775
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:34,129
Hey, Bart! Sheriff got the McGaffeys.
Got them in jail.

776
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,125
Want something, Mr. Bogardus?

777
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,035
Gonna have a sociable tonight.

778
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:19,908
Whole town's invited.

779
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:35,823
I promised the McGaffeys a fair trial,
and they're gonna get it.

780
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,059
They sure are.

781
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:41,964
Got a big white man's jury here.
The verdict's already in.

782
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,266
I figure Ed McGaffey's
gonna get hung,

783
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:51,003
but he's gonna get hung
the way the law says.

784
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,909
If you don't stand up for law and order
now, it don't mean nothing.

785
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,053
Now, who's coming with me?

786
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:22,740
Step up to the bar, boys.
The drinks are on me.

787
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:32,145
He didn't get no place with them.

788
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,345
He didn't try.

789
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:40,357
Sheriff! What'd they say? Sheriff?

790
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,997
- How many volunteered?
- Not one.

791
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,704
As officer of the court,
I have to keep out,

792
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:55,104
but I suggest you be
sworn in as deputies.

793
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:58,269
- We can't do that.
- You're respected, levelheaded men.

794
01:21:58,446 --> 01:22:02,576
Just your presence here, backing
up the sheriff, will avert violence.

795
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:06,949
What's going on?

796
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:09,386
They wanna get the McGaffeys
and hang them.

797
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:12,958
- Well, you can hold them off.
- Just what I'm saying, Hickman.

798
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,653
- The sheriff can use you as a deputy.
- Not me.

799
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:19,960
- We can't mix up in a thing like this.
- We can't stand up against the town.

800
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,296
That's the sheriff's job.

801
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:26,972
- Get the prisoners out of town.
- Take them out the back way.

802
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:30,509
They got a good jail in Dry Fork.
Hold them there for trial.

803
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:33,409
You won't get them a mile out of town.
It's murder.

804
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:35,745
Yes, it is.

805
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:40,042
- Well, we've done all we can.
- Yeah.

806
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:50,930
Be sensible, Ben.
Get your prisoners out of town.

807
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:58,368
Well, Ben, I guess I'll have
to turn tail and run too.

808
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,804
I hope you understand why.

809
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,878
- Yes, sir, I do.
- You're a good sheriff.

810
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:08,072
I didn't think you'd make it
when you put on that badge.

811
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:10,114
Know when to give up, Ben.

812
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:13,083
Don't get hurt. We need you.

813
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,685
Well, how do you like this?

814
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,631
Well, were you ever
through a thing like this?

815
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:08,100
- Yeah?
- Try and hold them.

816
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,010
With a shotgun.
Talks louder to a crowd.

817
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,739
What do I do now?

818
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,445
Wait.

819
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:50,110
They gotta get wound up first.
Takes time and plenty of liquor.

820
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:55,546
Mob's only as tough as its leader.
You only got one man to lick:

821
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:57,486
Bogardus.

822
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:14,626
How come they're so quiet?

823
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:18,766
Because they're ready.

824
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:10,678
Bring out your prisoners, sheriff.
Jury's awaiting.

825
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:13,343
My prisoners are gonna
be tried fair, Bogardus.

826
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,649
Fair and fast, sheriff.
The rope's all ready.

827
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,693
You gonna fetch them out,
or do we go get them?

828
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:30,463
You're a brave man when you've got
100 better men to back you up.

829
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:33,232
Why don't you come on
and get them by yourself.

830
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:35,341
Come on, Bogardus!

831
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,742
Come on, Bogardus,
you was a whole posse today.

832
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,612
Didn't get no prisoners, though.

833
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,277
Aren't you man enough
to come and get them now?

834
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,355
Come on, what's keeping you?

835
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,685
Put down that gun or
I'll tear you apart.

836
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:55,625
You fight with your mouth and with
your hat. Don't reach no further.

837
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:57,856
This thing might go off, both barrels.

838
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,737
Would you hold this, sheriff?

839
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:40,139
I'd like to talk to Bogardus.

840
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:19,777
All right, I put down the shotgun,
Bogardus. Now tear me apart.

841
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:25,046
What's the matter, you paralyzed?
Tear me apart!

842
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:30,717
What do you need,
a little persuasion?

843
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:23,239
Come on.

844
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:30,644
Dinky! Dinky, we're going.
We're going, Dinky.

845
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:34,848
Morg!

846
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:37,289
- You're not leaving now?
- Yep.

847
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,688
Well, what about the trial?

848
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:43,353
It'll be a fair trial. That's what
you promised them, sheriff.

849
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:48,496
- How about Kip's reward money?
- I'll write you where to send it.

850
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:51,971
Morg, don't go.

851
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:55,131
Stay and be sheriff.
Let me be your deputy till I learn.

852
01:31:55,309 --> 01:31:59,336
You've got nothing more to learn.
Maybe I learned from you.

853
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,573
A man can't run away from his job.

854
01:32:01,749 --> 01:32:04,309
Neither can a woman.
Dr. Joe told me.

855
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:06,180
Well, doc's right.

856
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:09,517
I'll find me a town needs
a sheriff. You got one here.

857
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,954
You say yes, Millie,
and stop worrying.

858
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:14,720
I'll worry the rest of my life.

859
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:16,595
So long.

860
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:19,232
- Bye.
- So long.

861
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:24,670
- So long, folks!
- Bye, Hickman!

862
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:28,434
- So long, Hickman!
- Good luck!

863
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:46,149
