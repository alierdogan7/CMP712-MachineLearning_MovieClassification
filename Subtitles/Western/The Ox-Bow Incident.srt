His girl? If you mean

- I'd rather you told us.
- <i>[ Horses Approaching ]</i>

477
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:32,626
Well, we must be pretty important.
Or else awfully dangerous.

478
00:38:32,698 --> 00:38:34,632
It ain't that
you're so dangerous.

479
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,158
It's just that most
of the men ain't never seen
a real triple hangin'.

480
00:38:38,237 --> 00:38:40,330
A hangin'?
What have we done?

481
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:45,366
Aren't you even gonna tell us
what we're accused of?

482
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:47,878
- Rustlin'. Ever hear of it?
- Rustlin'?

483
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:50,575
And murder.

484
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:54,953
Murder?

485
00:38:55,955 --> 00:39:00,085
Oh, Mr. Martin,
what did we do?

486
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,184
It's all right, Dad.
There's some mistake.

487
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,613
Remember me?

488
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,684
- [ Grunts ]
- He's talkin' to ya, mister.

489
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,186
- <i>No sabe.</i>
- He don't speak English.

490
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,655
- I got a different notion.
- I'll make him talk.

491
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,320
- <i>That'll do, Farnley!.</i>
- Listen, your wife had enough
of you playin' God Almighty.

492
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,489
Who picked you
for this job anyhow?

493
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,227
We got him. I say
let's swing him before
we all freeze to death!

494
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,394
You cold? Here's a fire.
Warm yourself.

495
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,768
And I'll advise you
to control your tongue too.

496
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,807
We'll get along better.

497
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,536
- Who's boss of this outfit?
- I am.

498
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,271
- And your name?
- Donald Martin.

499
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:44,281
- Where you from?
- Pike's Hole.

500
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:47,341
- <i>That's a lie!.</i>
- This gentleman's
from Pike's Hole.

501
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,352
Would you like
to change your story?

502
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,254
I just moved in three days ago.
I'm on Dave Baker's place
up on the north end.

503
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,725
Dave Baker moved out
four years ago,
and the place is a wreck.

504
00:39:56,794 --> 00:40:00,286
The barns are all fallin' down
and the sagebrush is stickin' up
through the porch.

505
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,596
Well, I bought the place
from him for $4,000
in Los Angeles last month.

506
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:07,570
- [ Laughs ]
Then, mister, you was robbed.
- Well, that may be.

507
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,598
But surely it's not so far
to Pike's Hole you can't go
over there and find out.

508
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,871
My wife's there right now...

509
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:19,349
- and my two kids.
- That's really too bad,
just too bad.

510
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,318
Even in this godforsaken country,
I've got a right to a trial!

511
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,220
You're getting a trial with 28
of the only kind of judges...

512
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:29,020
murderers and rustlers

this ""godforsaken country.''

513
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,823
So far, the jury
don't like your story.

514
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,660
Well, I'm not
gonna say another word
without a proper hearing.

515
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,997
<i>[ Ma ] Suit yourself.</i>
<i>But this is all the hearing</i>

<i>short of the LastJudgment.</i>

517
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,471
Have you any cattle
up here with you?

518
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,806
<i>Hey, Mr. Martin?</i>

519
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,348
[ Gagging ]

520
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,816
[ Laughs ]

521
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:56,718
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

522
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:03,357
- Yes, I have.
- How many?

523
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,794
- Fifty head.
- Where did you get 'em?

524
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,525
From Mr. Kinkaid.

525
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,897
That's just
what we figured, son.

526
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,493
I'm no rustler though.
I didn't steal 'em!

527
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,335
I bought 'em
and paid hard cash for them.

528
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,739
My own cattle were so bad,
I didn't want to risk bringin' 'em up.

529
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,541
So I sold them out at Salinas,
and I had to stock up again.

530
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,449
Well, you can wait can't ya,
till you can see Kinkaid?

531
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,152
- Or ask about me
over at Pike's Hole.
- That's a good one.

532
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,787
He's wants us to wait
and ask Larry Kinkaid.

533
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,127
<i>Gotta hand it to ya, Martin.</i>
<i>You're a cool one all right.</i>

534
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,895
You know as well as we do,
Kinkaid can't tell us anything.

535
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,096
- He's dead.
- Dead?

536
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,504
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>we're up here for?</i>

537
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,736
Well, how should I know?
He was all right yesterday afternoon.

538
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,507
Listen. Why don't
you stop this farce
and take us in!

539
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:59,550
'Cause the law's
slow and careless
around here sometimes.

540
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,381
We're here to see
it's speeded up.

541
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,513
- Who sent you up here?
- The sheriff.

542
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,184
-<i>[ Gil ] That ain't true!.</i>
-<i>[ Smith ] Let's don't get</i>
<i>started again.</i>

543
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,989
- <i>It's gettin'late.</i>
- The sheriff didn't
even know we were comin'.

544
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:13,963
I beg your pardon.
I should have said
the deputy sheriff.

545
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,762
Listen, men.
I'm not trying to obstruct justice...

546
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,861
but just as this young man says,
this is a farce.

547
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,634
And it'll be murder
if you carry it through.

548
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,474
All he's asking is what
every man's entitled to--
a fair trial.

549
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,605
<i>You say you're innocent, Martin,</i>
<i>and I, for one, believe you.</i>

<i>Then I guess you're</i>
<i>the only one, Arthur.</i>

<i>If there's anyjustice</i>
<i>in your proceedings, Tetley...</i>

552
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,153
it will only be
after a confession.

553
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,485
And they haven't confessed.
They say they're innocent...

554
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,718
- and you haven't proved they're not!
- Shut up!

555
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:44,125
- <i>[ Punch Landing ]</i>
- Have you a bill of sale
for those cattle?

556
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:47,892
Well, no, I haven't.
But Mr. Kinkaid said
it would be all right.

557
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,991
I couldn't find him at the house.
He was out on the range!

558
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,003
He didn't have
a bill of sale with him.
He said he'd mail it to me.

559
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,699
Moore. How long you been
ridin' with Kinkaid?

560
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:00,175
- Six years.
- Ever know him sell cattle
without a bill of sale?

561
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,077
N-N-No.
Can't say that I ever did.

562
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,981
[ Sniffles ]
Course, I can't remember
every head he sold in six years.

563
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,214
- But it's customary for him
to give a bill of sale?
- Y-Yep.

564
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:13,587
Ever know him to sell
cattle after spring roundup,
this or any other year?

565
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:18,561
<i>I can answer that.</i>
<i>I heard him say myself</i>
<i>just a couple of days ago...</i>

566
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:22,030
- he wouldn't sell a head
to nobody this spring.
- Well?

567
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,765
I know it looks bad giving a dead man
for a witness, but it's the truth.

568
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,297
- You don't believe me.
- Would you in my place?

569
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,970
I'd do a lot of finding out,
before hanging men
who might be innocent.

570
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:37,640
If it were only rustlin'
maybe, but-- but murder?

571
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,649

This is only slightly any
of your business, my friend.

I'd advise you to leave now

Otherwise,

become very tiresome.

- I still don't like it!
Hangin' murderers is one thing,
- Take it easy.

believe anything I tell you.

There's truth in lies too,

What do you know

- Confederate or Union?
- I don't know. He's not
clear about it himself.

- Not that.
