1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,161
<i>Previously on</i> Wynonna Earp.

2
00:00:02,197 --> 00:00:04,230
Seems there's a mole in my
organization, Jim.

3
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:06,599
And you are gonna help me find it.

4
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:09,102
Gus is getting
an offer to buy the bar.

5
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:11,704
- Decisions had to be made.
- What's this?

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,907
It's freedom! Now you can do
whatever it is you want.

7
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:18,144
Runaway, or who knows what kind
of trouble this girl got herself into.

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,047
- There are lacerations.
- Bite-marks.

9
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:23,149
From scavengers.

10
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:25,251
I got a message
for Wynonna Earp.

11
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,754
- Bobo bought Shorty's.
- (yelling and cheering)

12
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:34,060
Where is he? Where's Bobo? Ow!

13
00:00:34,095 --> 00:00:37,597
Hey! "Ow" is code for
"hands off," douche.

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,600
- The Heir!
- (clicking)

15
00:00:40,635 --> 00:00:42,635
Lower your guns

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,670
or I paint these walls
revenant brown faster

17
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:46,672
than a bad case of food poisoning.

18
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,474
Bloodbaths
are bad for business.

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,576
(intense music)

20
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:56,516
Jock, show these fine women

21
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,685
some hospitality. Girls.

22
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:01,654
- What'll you have?
- A tall glass

23
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,190
of "you're officially next
on my hell-bound and down list."

24
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:07,226
- You want some ice with that?
- You stole Gus's bar.

25
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:09,662
No, I paid what
she asked for it.

26
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:12,465
This is our stuff.

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,268
Papers are signed.

28
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,305
It's nice to see that we haven't
lost our favourite bar wench.

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,274
Yeah, I quit.

30
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:23,361
I'm gonna need
that T-shirt back.

31
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:25,978
Want me to help you peel it off?

32
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:28,147
- (men chuckling)
- Let's go.

33
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:30,183
Wait.

34
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:32,518
Now, you come into my business,

35
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:35,955
draw your weapons and insult me.

36
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,724
I'm gonna need a token of apology.

37
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:54,273
(gasp)

38
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:59,579
- That was Willa's.
- It's mine now.

39
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:08,130
I can't wait for you
to shoot him in the face.

40
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,303
Zoning out to Drake?

41
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,341
This "hotline bling"
only features revheads

42
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:29,708
enjoying watered-down beer.

43
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,878
Please, don't try to be cool.
It's literally the worst.

44
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:34,413
- You were supposed to wait.
- Are you saying we're in?

45
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,892
(beep)

46
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,572
(Bobo): Those Earp
girls may be bangable,

47
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:42,922
<i>but they're a boil on my scrotum.</i>

48
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:45,788
Hey! We're in.

49
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:50,596
(shaky): I'm out. I'm out.

50
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:52,765
I got out.

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,201
(whispering): I got out.

52
00:02:58,172 --> 00:03:01,707
Well. Some days, the meat
walks right into your lap.

53
00:03:01,743 --> 00:03:03,776
(spitting)

54
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:08,580
Do you have a phone?

55
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:12,985
- I need a phone.
- Come on inside, darlin',

56
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:15,955
sure. You can ring my ding-a-ling.

57
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,190
(spitting)

58
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:21,160
What's that you got there?

59
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:23,195
Jesus.

60
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,665
Next gas station's a mile back that way.

61
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,334
Get moving. I mean it, girlie. Git!

62
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:29,876
Can you just...

63
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:33,606
tell my Mom that I'm sorry I ran off?

64
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:35,574
I was so angry

65
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,844
and I was so wrong.

66
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,112
When she comes to collect me,
can you just tell her

67
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:42,481
- that I love her?
- (growling)

68
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:48,621
- (snarling)
- Please.

69
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,324
- (screaming)
- Won't be nothing left

70
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,359
- of you to fetch.
- (screaming)

They're talking
about Dolls, guys!

78
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:28,461
They're speculating
that your penis is small!

79
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:33,299
Going in just the two
of you? Pretty risky.

80
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,334
There was an opening.

81
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,536
And we would've loved some
backup, but you went AWOL.

82
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:39,972
How long have you known
that Bobo is telekinetic?

83
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:42,074
So he can move objects
with the power of his mind.

84
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,377
- I got a big shiny gun.
- Yeah, and if he can yank

85
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:46,545
- a necklace, why not Peacemaker?
- I don't know.

86
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:49,281
How about we get him alone
and shoot him with Peacemaker,

87
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:52,051
and then it won't matter?
Send this prick back

88
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:54,653
to hell, not have him hosting happy hour

89
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:56,207
at my favourite bar.

90
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,724
Hey. Literally all
they're talking about

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,826
is how many pints they can chug.

92
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,928
Men are all the same,
even the demonic ones.

93
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,968
Surveillance:
mucho taxing on my bladder.

94
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:08,734
(door opening)

95
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,803
Alright, look.
I'm sorry that I missed

96
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:12,838
your infiltration of Shorty's, OK?

97
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:16,442
Nice try. I already clocked
the bruises on your knuckles.

98
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,345
(sighing)

99
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,714
Sorry I didn't tell you about
stupid Bobo's stupid powers.

100
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,884
But we are so close.

101
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,353
OK.

102
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:29,388
Bobo wanted Constance
Clootie to give him

103
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:31,991
some way out of the
Ghost River Triangle.

104
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,061
- Some... lead.
- A lead? Like a clue?

105
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:36,929
Right? Who knows. Anyway,
she didn't give it to him;

106
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:39,231
or lied about ever having it and now

107
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:42,268
he's up shit creek.
So what's his new escape plan?

108
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:45,371
Yeah, why buy Shorty's?
To infiltrate the town?

109
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:47,606
- To piss us off?
- That can be a bonus feature.

110
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,708
But the bar does
have doors that can lock

111
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:52,722
and is often filled with human
civilians. Human civilians who...

112
00:05:52,757 --> 00:05:54,947
Who would freak if
their designer overalls

113
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:57,716
were splattered with
gooey brown demon brain.

114
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:03,222
Perfect cover. As long as he's
in there, we can't go in hot,

115
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:06,092
or... boom! Mutually
assured destruction.

116
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:08,227
- Listen.
- (man):<i> Why we gotta be</i>

117
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:11,664
<i>so out in the open, boss?</i>
Trailer park, we was protected.

118
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,533
(music playing)

119
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,126
You don't think
I'll protect you?

120
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:19,772
No, Bobo, it's just...
the heir.

121
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,807
- Ohh.
- (man speaking Cantonese)

122
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,310
(speaking Cantonese)

123
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,846
She got Whiskey Jim, too.
<i>He ain't been seen in days.</i>

124
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:29,115
- What's a Whiskey Jim?
- Shh, please. I'm just trying

125
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,718
to listen, OK? Thanks.

126
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,521
He's back! Bobo!

127
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:37,081
He's back!

128
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:40,226
Cal, calm your tits.
Have a drink.

129
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:44,248
LOU!

130
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:47,867
Impossible.

131
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:50,636
There's no way he would
cross back into my territory.

132
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,472
- We had a deal...
- No, I seen this twinkie.

133
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:56,008
She bore his mark.

134
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,807
And then she...

135
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:01,380
And then he... LOU!

136
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,883
Goddammit!

137
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,951
Do me a goddamn favour.

138
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,654
All of you!

139
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:12,024
Refrain from mentioning that name,

140
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:15,060
because the next piece
of excrement who utters it

141
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,530
will get the Levi treatment.

142
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,499
Hell's Gate, burning insanity,

143
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:22,902
the whole nine yards. <i>Comprende?</i>

144
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,004
- (high-pitched ringing)
- What the hell, Cal?

145
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,039
(groaning)

146
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:29,074
It's this goddamn tin tooth.

147
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,811
It picks up radio frequencies sometimes.

148
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,847
What kind of frequencies?

149
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,918
(grunting)

150
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,957
(high-pitched ringing) Eeny...

151
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:47,326
meeny...

152
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,562
miny...

153
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:51,664
(high-pitched ringing)

154
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,866
...hoes.

155
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,735
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, we're burnt.

156
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:18,357
Hi. [It seems I'm not the
only one with eyes and ears]

157
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:21,393
[on Purgatory. Well,
here's a juicy little tidbit]

158
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:23,929
[even Deputy Marshal Dolls
may not have heard:]

159
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:26,532
Doc Holliday has been boarding

160
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,101
his 130 year old mustang

161
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:32,304
in Wynonna Earp's ample paddock.

162
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,541
[Makes me think of bringing my
own horse in for a little love.]

163
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:37,910
Giddy up!

164
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,817
(beep)

165
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:47,319
What... Who is this
Lou guy? Did you hear that?

166
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:49,588
I have never heard Bobo so unsettled.

167
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,557
Have you? I haven't.

168
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,926
Maybe we can use him,
you know? Track him down?

169
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,128
My enemy's enemy. Perfect.

170
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:59,732
- Yeah.
- Lou. Lou bird.

171
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,401
Louie Luau. That's what
we should concentrate on.

172
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:04,803
That is the take-away here. Big time.

173
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,239
Yeah. Bae, don't hurt
yourself. Right, Earp?

174
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:10,009
I'm gonna find some more
information on this Lou guy.

175
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,811
- You think he's a revenant?
- If he is,

176
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:15,781
maybe we can make an agreement.
Extra time up here

177
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:18,150
for some more information
on Bobo Del Rey, alright?

178
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:22,533
Where are you
going now? Again?

179
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,843
- I'm going to go do my thing.
- Your thing?

180
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:28,594
Earp, please, just don't
get distracted by Doc's horse.

181
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,330
There it is. Hey!

182
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,833
Don't forget your phone.

183
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:37,202
- Thanks.
- Yep.

184
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:43,575
Shit.

185
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:55,387
(Wynonna sighing)

186
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,557
Why are you guys in Nedley's office?

187
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:01,293
- 'Cause when...
- Yes.

188
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:03,395
OK, here she blows.

189
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:04,646
Uh...

190
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,333
Doc and I slept together.

191
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:09,813
And that's news? Really?

192
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,372
- To you, OK.
- (phone ringing)

193
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,811
Really? We're both grownups.

194
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,943
One of you is a little bit
more grown up, don't you think?

195
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:22,981
- Little bit.
- Why are you

196
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:25,584
- telling me this now?
- It's out there. Thanks, Bobo.

197
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:29,188
- Bobo knows?
- Yes. And Dolls.

198
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:33,158
Uh-oh. Well, do you love Doc?

199
00:10:33,194 --> 00:10:35,761
It was just sex, Waverly.

200
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,309
- God!
- That's not a no!

201
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,433
(growling)

202
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:46,004
(whimpering)

203
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,874
Jim. Seems Black Badge

204
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,255
has got themselves a rat.

205
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,975
Bobo, I swear.

206
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:55,714
I swear I didn't tell them nothing.

207
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,546
I know, Jim.

208
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:00,986
But you're going to start.

209
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,991
(intense music)

210
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,072
Hey, Mister, want a ride?

211
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:27,875
Always. Wynonna Earp,

212
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:31,545
the only woman so bold as to woo a man

213
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,348
- with another woman's car.
- I thought if anyone

214
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:36,297
should have it, it's you.

215
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:39,983
And exactly what
am I to do with it?

216
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:43,190
What do you usually do
with your enemy's horse?

217
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:45,693
Shoot it, ride it, paint it
something other than pink?

218
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:48,729
Colour is the only thing
this pony has going for it.

219
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:50,664
Strong, masculine.

220
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,182
Pink's traditionally
a girl's colour.

221
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:57,950
Oh, how history
rewrites itself.

222
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:01,642
Back in my day, girls were all
delicate and dainty in blues.

223
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:05,103
I think you would be...

224
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,577
very pretty in blue.

225
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:15,354
Everybody knows.

226
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:17,754
About us.

227
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:20,660
The sex.

228
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,954
I remember.

229
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:29,202
The sex.

230
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,171
Between us.
Not that there's

231
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:32,114
really an "us."

232
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:39,646
(beeping)

233
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:42,450
Dolls is on the move.

234
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,319
- Stalking multiple men, are we?
- Where the hell is he going?

235
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,893
♪♪♪

236
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:07,541
(alarm sounding)

237
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:15,415
Oh, hey!

238
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,051
- (beep)
- (alarm stops)

239
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,421
- You tracked me?
- Of course not.

240
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:24,091
I tracked your phone.

241
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,226
All the way to Serial Killers

242
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:27,608
Paradise, apparently.

243
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:30,597
- What are you doing here, Dolls?
- My job. Some of which

244
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,133
- you do not get to be privy to.
- So I sleep with Doc

245
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,002
and suddenly I'm on
a need-to-know basis, huh?

246
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:38,172
- Come on.
- Hey! Listen.

247
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:41,542
If you're keeping things
from me... important things...

248
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,914
A lot of men have hurt me
lately. Don't be one of them.

249
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:48,916
Listen to me: no one in there

250
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,784
is going to hurt you. OK?

251
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,603
Promise?

252
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,924
Yeah. Promise.

253
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,699
Good.

254
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:02,963
(metallic clicking)

255
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:05,299
Still, like to check it out for myself.

256
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:11,305
Earp, you're interfering
with government business. Earp!

257
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,007
Earp. Hey! Do not go in there.

258
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:16,143
Come here. Earp! Earp, hey.

259
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,612
EARP!

260
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,715
Holy elaborate torture shit.

261
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:29,248
- The Heir.
- Revenant scum.

262
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:32,559
Should have known.
How long you been here?

263
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,017
Well, it's kinda hard to tell.

264
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,036
Two weeks, maybe.

265
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:40,234
Time moves different when you're being
held against your will, doesn't it?

266
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:43,302
What does Dolls want with you?

267
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:46,440
Just keeps jabbing me
with his needles.

268
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:48,842
Thought he'd drain me dry.

269
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:50,844
Worst part is...

270
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,280
he never asks me nothing.

271
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:55,514
He's not much of a talker.

272
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:57,851
- (clicking)
- Me?

273
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:01,521
I'm a little more chatty. You're
one of Bobo's key guys, right?

274
00:15:01,557 --> 00:15:03,757
Tell me something:

275
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:06,159
- who's Lou?
- (door shutting)

276
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:09,696
(heavy breathing)

277
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:11,765
Well? Answer the woman.

278
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,268
- Answer her.
- Yeah, Lou.

279
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:17,271
So, Bobo's ex-boy-toy? Frenemy?

280
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,273
- What?
- More like archenemy.

281
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:22,173
Nobody tries to overthrow
Bobo and lives to tell.

282
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,212
Unless Lou's a serious badass
and Bobo is scared of him.

283
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:28,382
Bingo. Long time ago...

284
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,752
like, 100 years ago...

285
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:33,987
Lou and Bobo were thick as thieves.

286
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:36,098
Now the only thing is,

287
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,099
Lou had a very sadistic streak.

288
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,835
Whereas Bobo subsidized
the town daycare. Go on.

289
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,972
Well, Lou never understood
why revenants needed to hide,

290
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:47,642
disguise their true nature,

291
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:50,111
when we could rule.

292
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:52,446
Make you meat puppets our slaves.

293
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:54,448
Revenant proud. Got it.

294
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:56,751
- So Bobo cast him out?
- More like,

295
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:59,153
Bobo ran away. When Lou left,

296
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:01,322
he took something so dangerous,

297
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,324
no one would ever
try to cross him again.

298
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,793
- A weapon?
- Something like that.

299
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:07,695
OK.

300
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,630
Where do we find him?

301
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:13,167
No one's seen Lou for years.

302
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:16,602
Heir after heir, he never showed up.

303
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,308
- (sizzling)
- (screaming)

304
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:23,477
Dammit! He's in the Pine Barrens!

305
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:26,514
(groaning)

306
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:28,716
(wheezing)

307
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:31,385
See, Jimbo.
That wasn't so bad. Hmm?

308
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:36,023
No, no, ah, ah!

309
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,327
(screaming)

310
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:42,897
Pine Barrens. Beautiful
place, hella bad rep.

311
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:48,035
Big chemical spill a few years ago

312
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:51,172
and then rumours that
the trees are haunted,

313
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:53,507
as many years back as I can remember.

314
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:56,387
Jimmy-boy gave up Lou's locale
way too quickly. He's lying.

315
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:59,180
He's terrified. An involuntary
vacay at Club Torment

316
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:01,616
- will do that to you.
- My BBD superiors need

317
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,619
- a constant stream of samples.
- You kidnapped Whiskey Jim

318
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,954
- to keep feeding the beast?
- And to see how Bobo

319
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,504
and company got a hold of some pretty,
pretty high-level Black Badge intel.

320
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,061
You think we have a mole?

321
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:18,009
- Do you think it's me?
- Would I have just told you if I did?

322
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,296
(quietly): OK...

323
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,020
God.

324
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,273
This whole time you were
disappearing, I thought...

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,064
Thought what?

326
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:31,679
I thought you were sick. OK?

327
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:34,315
I thought you were bad sick,
like don't tell your friends

328
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,617
'cause it's gonna scare them
sick. I thought you were sick!

329
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:39,286
- 'Cause sometimes you get sick.
- OK. Alright!

330
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:40,864
But you're not, so
I can be pissed at you.

331
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:42,623
Have at 'er then, geez.

332
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:45,559
I'm not sick, exactly.

333
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:48,095
Lou's here, Dolls. Right here.

334
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,515
Torture doesn't result in
actionable intelligence, OK?

335
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:54,366
Those things
are cockroaches to me...

336
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:57,071
Don't do that. Do not
do that. I saw your eyes

337
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:59,206
back there. They were cold and callous.

338
00:17:59,242 --> 00:18:01,242
Don't get all hard and
forget that you're human.

339
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:02,809
That you are you.

340
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:06,013
- I won't.
- Just remember,

341
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,916
revenants will say anything with a ticket
to Hell pressed to their forehead.

342
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:12,452
Those the warmest
shoes you got?

343
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,893
(intense music)

344
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:31,772
Hear that?
What?

345
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,754
A whole lot of nothing that'll
kill you if you lose focus.

346
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,226
Funny.

347
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,145
I actually have training
in hostile environment

348
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:41,615
- survival tactics.
- You also grew up in Arizona.

349
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:43,984
- How'd you know that?
- Most excited I ever saw you

350
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,180
get was when the Cardinals
beat the Cowboys.

351
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:47,755
That was an amazing goal.

352
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,724
Look, we stay in each
other's sights at all times.

353
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:51,726
Stay hydrated, but
don't get anything wet.

354
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:54,758
Watch the UV rays. Killer
when they bounce off snow.

355
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:57,598
Sylvan dread.

356
00:18:57,634 --> 00:19:00,268
- Who what now?
- Also known as hylophobia.

357
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,252
It's an intense fear of the woods.

358
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:05,071
Awesome. Let's do this!

359
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,565
(door opening)

360
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:17,181
(door closing)

361
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:20,721
(birds chirping)

362
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,908
Where'd you get that?

363
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:28,996
A vexing present from Wynonna.

364
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:31,832
You two knocked boots,
now she's giving you gifts?

365
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,011
Please!

366
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:35,803
A gentleman always removes his boots.

367
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:38,205
- Ew!
- Your childish attitude

368
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:40,908
- on the matter is noted.
- It's your attitude

369
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,910
that I'm worried about.

370
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:45,479
This whole "relationship" is
a train wreck waiting to happen.

371
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,481
I mean, what will the team
do when you two implode?

372
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:49,517
Wynonna and I are not in
a relationship. Sex alone

373
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:52,753
- a relationship does not make.
- Again, ew.

374
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:54,588
I do not kiss and tell,
especially with a lady friend's

375
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,824
little sister. What's important is:

376
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:59,493
why did she give me a car?

377
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,495
OK, so you're just gonna
smash this thing to bits

378
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:03,497
- 'cause it feels good?
- Well, unless you've got

379
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,300
- a better suggestion.
- You could learn to drive.

380
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:09,303
Just an idea.

381
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,009
Indeed.

382
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:23,617
OK. I think Whiskey Jim
might've been pulling my boob.

383
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:27,355
(bird cawing)

384
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,426
- Silver dreads?
- Let's just say:

385
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:35,563
I lost people, once, amongst the trees.

386
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,071
What people?

387
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:40,368
(birds cawing)

388
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:43,904
(cacophony of cawing)

389
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:45,759
What a racket!

390
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:49,076
What are they singing?

391
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:50,870
Funeral dirge.

392
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,416
Earp!

393
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,785
(grunt)

394
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,087
- Earp!
- (cracking)

395
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,390
Earp!

396
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:04,220
- Earp!
- Dolls?

397
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,495
Sun's gonna start heading down.
We should head back.

398
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:10,898
- It's too soon!
- Dolls?

399
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,330
Wynonna?

400
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:17,370
Dolls, are you getting this?

401
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,543
- (birds crying)
- Earp,

402
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:25,079
- if you're messing with me, I...
- Xavier!

403
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:27,615
(echoing): Xavier! Xavier!

404
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:33,154
- Wynonna, where are you?
- I'm here, silly.

405
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:34,426
Look at it.

406
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,759
- (squawking)
- I am!

407
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:46,567
It's beautiful,
Dolls. Come on!

408
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:59,805
Oh, shit. I'm dead, aren't I?

409
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:06,498
You have been reborn,
and soon you will meet Yiska.

410
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,895
Cool.

411
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,171
- Anybody got an Advil?
- Who are you?

412
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:17,576
Courtney. You must be Yiska.

413
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:20,145
My name is Eve. This is Margo.

414
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,517
I'm the one you seek.

415
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,854
Have you come to us seeking liberation

416
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,957
from the mind control of their
radio waves and phone towers?

417
00:22:31,993 --> 00:22:34,426
Have I! Uh-huh.

418
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,662
You guys were not easy
to find without Google Maps.

419
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,904
So this isn't yours?

420
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,837
An evil I'll be
glad to do without.

421
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:50,984
Yeah. Totally didn't need that.

422
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,453
I sense darkness
in you. Deceit.

423
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:55,455
And usually a pint or two.

424
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,990
You yourself say
the light never lies.

425
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:01,061
- It chose her.
- Yeah, the light! That was...

426
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,095
warm.

427
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,832
You are safe here,
amongst your sisters.

428
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:08,268
'K. What are you?

429
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,337
Those that need to be led

430
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:14,007
seek me out and I give them guidance.

431
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:16,710
I don't follow very well.

432
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,279
I'd say I'm more of a fighter.

433
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:21,949
We have room
for those as well.

434
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,918
Your bath is ready.

435
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,114
My... my bath?

436
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:30,857
(murmuring): What the fudge?

437
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:33,894
Oh, yeah.

438
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,467
Awesome. Do I just...

439
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:42,436
Nope?

440
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:44,870
OK.

441
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:46,860
Woo!

442
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,043
Spa vibe.

443
00:23:53,076 --> 00:23:55,782
Here I go!

444
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,620
It's hot!

445
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,757
So... relaxing.

446
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:08,095
(bird shrieking)

447
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,833
Did you burn the rest of my stuff?

448
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,635
Even the stuff that wasn't,
you know, flammable?

449
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,637
Like a thing that
goes around your waist?

450
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:20,240
- Maybe...
- Guns are the devil's teeth.

451
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:22,641
Oh, but shiny though, right?

452
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:24,911
- You mock me.
- No... no, I'm not.

453
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:27,881
You're right. Guns ruin lives.

454
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,316
(girls whispering)

455
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:32,319
I only shoot bad guys.

456
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:35,989
That's the point of... me. Of it.

457
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:38,191
How can you tell
the good from the bad?

458
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,761
Um... the good ones
are usually scared.

459
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:43,220
But they push past the fear,

460
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:46,565
you know? And they do what's
right, even when it hurts.

461
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:50,203
Even when every instinct is
telling them to do nothing,

462
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,073
to survive.

463
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:55,175
And the good ones are hotter.

464
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,297
- (grunting)
- (zapping)

465
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:03,183
(groaning)

466
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:06,472
(coughing)

467
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:08,139
We found him out by the ridge.

468
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,590
Had to zap him three times
before he calmed down.

469
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:15,962
- We are a peace-loving people.
- Yet holding me hostage

470
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:18,532
can be interpreted
as an act of terrorism!

471
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,768
(coughing)

472
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,408
Take this upstairs.

473
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,143
Who knew

474
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,612
we would be blessed
with so many visitors today.

475
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,286
(Wynonna):
<i>Is Yiska his real name?</i>

476
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:42,189
Course not. He says
there are outsiders

477
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:45,358
who don't understand our
commune, even fear us.

478
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:47,389
Fear him.

479
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:48,622
Do you?

480
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,167
What's Yiska going to do with that man?

481
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:57,944
He won't last
long in the hole.

482
00:25:59,013 --> 00:26:01,274
Sounds less than five-star.

483
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:04,511
The root cellar,
behind the greenhouse.

484
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,493
That's where you'll sleep.

485
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,309
I sleep here.

486
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,019
Don't worry though, I don't snore.

487
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:16,256
Me neither, unless
there's bourbon involved.

488
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:23,096
Uh... bedpan?

489
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:25,532
Unless you want to go search
for the outhouse in the night.

490
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:26,894
Hard pass.

491
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,978
My first night here,
I sobbed into my pillow.

492
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:40,280
Soaked it right through.

493
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,217
Jen came and gave me a handkerchief

494
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,520
and some hot chocolate.
She didn't say anything,

495
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:48,350
she just gave it to me.

496
00:26:49,057 --> 00:26:50,845
It sounds insignificant,

497
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:52,813
but it made all the difference.

498
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:56,897
- Where's Jen now?
- Once you are driven away,

499
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:58,637
there's no coming back.

500
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:02,502
Did Yiska ever mention
someone named Bobo?

501
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,551
Bobo?

502
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,075
That can't possibly be a real person.

503
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,247
There. You're all set.

504
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:17,651
I feel a real connection
with you, Courtney.

505
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:20,549
Yeah, ditto.

506
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:22,756
(grunting)

507
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:26,125
(whispering): Sorry!
I hope that was clean!

508
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:31,198
(wind howling)

509
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,149
(whispering): Hi.

510
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,137
- Brought you a blankie.
- What took you so long?

511
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:39,706
The mani-pedis here
are incredible.

512
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,042
- What happened to you?
- Saw a weird light,

513
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,277
blacked out,

514
00:27:44,313 --> 00:27:46,613
woke up in a creepy chapel.

515
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:48,882
Yeah, you saw
those creepy crows?

516
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,474
Mondays, amiright? Come on!

517
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:54,421
So, have you got eyes on Lou?

518
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,523
His acolytes call him Yiska.

519
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:58,658
That's a Navajo name.

520
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:01,561
Well, what's their word
for "sleazy demon pervert"?

521
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,630
They think he's some kind
of benevolent leader.

522
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:05,799
Typical brainwashing.
Any word on a weapon

523
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,283
that could scare Bobo?

524
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,554
Bobo.

525
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:21,114
That narcissist finally figure out

526
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:23,450
that his stupid
fur coat won't protect him?

527
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,419
Who in the world
is this "Bobo"?

528
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,092
A common enemy.

529
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:32,825
I have no enemies...

530
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,597
...that are in anything...

531
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,100
(low voice): ...but pieces.

532
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
(grunting)

533
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,012
So what do you think?
Sacrifice?

534
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,281
Or a seriously
off-the-hook bat mitzvah.

535
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:57,217
You have betrayed the peaceful
people of this place.

536
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,758
You are no longer

537
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:07,327
welcome.
Just like you weren't welcome

538
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:10,497
- back in Purgatory, huh?
- My name is Wynonna Earp.

539
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,866
I come from a long line of Earps
who have been hunting down

540
00:29:12,901 --> 00:29:15,068
the likes of your leader for decades.

541
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:17,836
The Heir?

542
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:19,906
Seriously, Yiska,
what is going on?

543
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:23,276
Fate. Irony.

544
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:26,479
And inevitably, boredom.

545
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,517
Let's get this show on
the road, shall we, Eve?

546
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:40,360
- (muffled protests)
- May you find safe passage.

547
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:49,569
- So that's it? We're free to go?
- I wouldn't put it that way.

548
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,193
(intense music)

549
00:29:58,946 --> 00:30:00,980
(grunting)

550
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:03,082
(tires squealing)

551
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,123
(grunting)

552
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:12,392
(loud exhale)

553
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:13,973
Oh, what a night.

554
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,430
(heavy breathing)

555
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:20,600
Does anybody have a phone? No?

556
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:22,702
Don't all answer at once.

557
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:31,144
Eve must have convinced them to
drop me in the middle of town

558
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,213
to look into this.

559
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,717
Voicemail... which
Dolls never listens to

560
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,719
because he says it's antiquated.

561
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,323
Yo, dummy, stop being a dingus

562
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,525
and call me back.

563
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,694
And please be OK, also.

564
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,967
Are you alright there?
What's that?

565
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:56,035
It's like Sharpie.
It won't come off.

566
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,438
Find anything?

567
00:30:58,473 --> 00:31:00,740
Every single girl on
this list? Found dead,

568
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,143
scattered around the Ghost
River Triangle. Autopsies say

569
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:06,012
that they were toyed
with and then killed

570
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,348
by animals that had gone rogue.

571
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:11,451
- Rabies?
- No. Just... torture.

572
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,716
Like, every single bone
in their body broken,

573
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:18,436
their skin licked off.
This is why I don't do pets.

574
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,377
Have you seen
the last word on the list?

575
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,545
Yeah. "Help."

576
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,482
Eve and the rest of those
girls are still out there.

577
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,128
With lunatic Lou.

578
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:31,220
Delinquents and runaways.
I mean, it could have

579
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:33,555
just as easily been me back then,

580
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,951
got sucked into this asshat's scheme.

581
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,661
Whiskey Jim said he has a weapon.

582
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:42,031
So do you. A big gun.

583
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:44,733
- I lost it in the Pine Barrens.
- What?!

584
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,237
Along with my partner.
Why is he not back yet?

585
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,350
Maybe they didn't
drop him in Purgatory.

586
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,808
Which means he's
alone. In the woods.

587
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,377
Which he hates.

588
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:57,646
Shit!

589
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,986
- Hey.
- OK, so where were we?

590
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:06,021
Because I seem to think it was
something about, like, candles,

591
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,824
you trying to get me into a sexy
black dress... Something's wrong.

592
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:11,627
A lot of things
might be wrong.

593
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:14,396
Dolls and Wynonna and her gun...

594
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,932
What is the deal
with that gun anyway?

595
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,101
(woman): <i>We have reports
of a pink, four-doored sedan</i>

596
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,904
<i>driving erratically on highway 81.</i>

597
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:24,206
<i>-Please respond.</i>
- Did she say pink?

598
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:27,376
Earp! Earp!

599
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:30,346
Wynonna!

600
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,882
Oh, shit. Oh, come on.

601
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,151
(groaning)

602
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,487
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

603
00:32:38,522 --> 00:32:40,789
- (beeping)
- Yeah!

604
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,792
(heavy breathing)

605
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,028
Here we go. Let's go.

606
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,597
Come on!

607
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:51,700
One, two, three.

608
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,939
(groaning)

609
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,276
Alright. Stay cool.

610
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,746
- Stay cool.
- (clicking)

611
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,115
Yes. Right.

612
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,684
Freezing my ass off. OK.

613
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,490
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

614
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,281
OK, baby. Gimme. Come on.

615
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:19,495
- (beeping)
- Go. Oh, come on, come on,

616
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,231
come on, come on, come on, come
on. Come on, heat, let's go.

617
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,933
(snarling)

618
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,136
Oh, damn.

619
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,904
I really hope you're not
as hungry as you look.

620
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,073
- (growling)
- Hey! Alright.

621
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,411
OK! Nice doggie.

622
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,347
Nice doggie.

623
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:45,254
This... is not good.

624
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,261
- (birds chirping)
- (radio playing quietly)

625
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,364
Hey...

626
00:33:56,026 --> 00:33:57,490
You're doing 140 in a 50 zone.

627
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:00,536
Licence and registration?

628
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,571
Well, it's me, Officer Haught.

629
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:04,807
And I have neither of those things.

630
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:08,674
- Oh, boy.
- How about an explanation, huh?

631
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,090
If there is any kindness
in you, you will arrest me,

632
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:14,016
and quick.
Sorry there, Stone Cold.

633
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:15,907
Not getting off so easy.

634
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:24,917
Dolls? DOLLS!

635
00:34:25,576 --> 00:34:27,886
How could you just disappear?
That's impossible.

636
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:31,156
What am I talking about?
I disappeared. DOLLS!

637
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:33,692
(shushing)

638
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:37,062
The wolf will hear us.

639
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:39,531
You're alive. What wolf?

640
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:42,434
Sh. Looking for this?

641
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,738
And here I thought you
were just happy to see me.

642
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:48,073
Oh, I have missed you!

643
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:50,909
Oh, you're freezing.

644
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,945
- (distant snarling)
- Oh, that wolf.

645
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:56,682
Oh, yeah. Let's go.

646
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,153
Wrong way, Earp. Where are you going?

647
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:03,088
- To save the hippie chicks.
- From what?

648
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:05,224
The weapon!

649
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,491
(chirping)

650
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,222
So where do you
think you're going?

651
00:35:17,258 --> 00:35:20,363
I thought I'd visit
my Mama's grave in Valdosta.

652
00:35:20,398 --> 00:35:22,750
- 'Bout time, I reckon.
- Bullshit.

653
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:24,767
- You're headed northeast.
- I have vanquished my enemy.

654
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:27,326
I have taken her horse.
I am finished here, Waverly.

655
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:30,286
- This was your plan the whole time.
- No, this was your plan.

656
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:32,905
- You told me to learn to drive.
- I didn't mean leave Purgatory

657
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,452
without a word!

658
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:36,713
I do hate goodbyes.

659
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:40,066
Look, we need you, OK?

660
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:42,881
She needs you.

661
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:47,319
She has Dolls.

662
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,625
Can't you at least try?

663
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,617
I mean, I'm trying with Nicole.

664
00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:57,696
Difference is,

665
00:35:57,731 --> 00:35:59,801
she adores you back.

666
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,102
(engine starting)

667
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,046
♪♪♪

668
00:36:19,086 --> 00:36:21,587
♪♪♪

669
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:34,967
What are you doing?

670
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:37,536
The world we worked
so hard to create

671
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,372
has been sullied by outsiders.

672
00:36:40,726 --> 00:36:42,274
We must disband.

673
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:44,038
Become pure.

674
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,962
Then we can begin to rebuild.

675
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,414
You are so great and wise.

676
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:52,392
Sisters, he's lying...

677
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:53,783
(gasp)

678
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:58,232
Always so high and mighty.

679
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:01,502
Your impurity was poison to us all...

680
00:37:02,528 --> 00:37:04,204
Eve.

681
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,979
(intense music)

682
00:37:12,014 --> 00:37:14,715
The women cast out from the
cult were devoured by an animal!

683
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,351
Of course. The wolf, the crow.

684
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:19,453
- Get it?
- Not even a little.

685
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:24,024
Yiska. In Navajo
mythology there are humans

686
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,660
that can take the form
of animals. Skinwalkers.

687
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:29,229
We're a long way
from Navajo territory.

688
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:31,565
Yeah, but smack in the middle
of the Ghost River Triangle.

689
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:35,502
It would explain how Lou
managed to protect himself

690
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:37,309
against Bobo's vengeance.

691
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:40,207
How did you find this place
again? I had to get freaky

692
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:42,743
- with a warm light.
- Please. I'm a walking GPS.

693
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:44,028
I pinged that shit.

694
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:45,462
Nice.

695
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:50,851
- (women murmuring)
- You came back.

696
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:52,457
You watched me take a bath.
That shit bonds for life.

697
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:54,073
I knew our
connection was real.

698
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:57,090
Totes. You wanna tell me
about this shitty face paint?

699
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,359
They mark all
those who are prey.

700
00:37:59,395 --> 00:38:01,595
And Yiska marked us all, before he left.

701
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,797
- What a prince.
- He will rise again

702
00:38:03,832 --> 00:38:05,766
to make us clear once more!

703
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:07,801
God, you're such a moron.

704
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:10,370
He cast us out, Margo. He lied to us.

705
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:12,406
When we leave here, we die.

706
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:14,975
Hey. I didn't.

707
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,977
- (distant growling)
- (women gasping)

708
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:19,112
Earp, I think we just
lured the Skinwalker

709
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:21,148
back to a whole bunch
of free-range dinners.

710
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:23,317
(distant screaming)

711
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:25,218
- Hey. Can you find him?
- Cowards always have

712
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:28,487
an escape route. And sometimes...

713
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:29,656
a snowmobile.

714
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:31,758
Earp, go with Eve.

715
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:34,094
The only way to stop this
Skinwalker is to sever its ties

716
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:36,697
- with its captor, OK?
- So, kill Lou's revenant ass?

717
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,499
Yeah. Business as usual. Come on.

718
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:40,521
Alright, ladies.

719
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,770
Up the stairs.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

720
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:46,139
This way!

721
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:48,342
- (Dolls): Now! Come on!
- (women yelling)

722
00:38:48,377 --> 00:38:51,111
(intense music)

723
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:53,580
Yiska, stop!

724
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:54,783
Lou!

725
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:58,452
What are you? A devil?

726
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:01,788
(low voice): I'm a god!
I have outlived three Heirs.

727
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:04,458
Bitch here makes it four.

728
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:07,260
You can't hide
from me. Or this.

729
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:09,296
(laughing)

730
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:11,591
Who said anything
about hiding?

731
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:15,369
(roaring)

732
00:39:15,404 --> 00:39:19,006
- (screaming)
- Bear! Big bear! Bear!

733
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,095
(groaning)

734
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,514
- Sayonara, bitches.
- Eve, the gun!

735
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,483
- It won't stop the bear!
- Not the bear!

736
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:33,387
- Just the asshole!
- (engine revving)

737
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:36,723
AH! Eve! Eve!

738
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:38,892
(bear roaring)

739
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:41,261
- (bang)
- (screaming)

740
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:45,198
(Lou screaming)

741
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,167
Thank you.

742
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:49,536
(cracking)

743
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:52,639
(fire roaring)

744
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:00,881
What the hell was that?

745
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:03,116
The impossible.

746
00:40:08,387 --> 00:40:10,154
(soft music)

747
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:14,259
So I found an old photo
in Waverly's research,

748
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:17,762
of Lou's first wife.
Her name was Tadewi.

749
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:21,132
She was a horse whisperer of sorts

750
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,101
and there were whispers about her.

751
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,370
Lou was likely using her as a weapon

752
00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:27,372
for over 100 years.

753
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:29,641
An actual Skinwalker.

754
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:31,843
Seems like the Ghost River
Triangle is playing host

755
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:34,545
to a whole realm of
supernatural phenomenon. This...

756
00:40:35,252 --> 00:40:36,932
This is huge.

757
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:41,686
She didn't remember anything

758
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:43,850
- since Lou found her, huh?
- Uh-uh.

759
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,959
Yeah. Prolonged
psychological trauma

760
00:40:47,994 --> 00:40:50,094
can cause amnesia.

761
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,130
(Dolls sighing)

762
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:54,799
She may have been brainwashed. Or...

763
00:40:57,502 --> 00:41:00,705
- ...she's lying.
- She's not lying.

764
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:04,267
We thought she was dead.

765
00:41:07,013 --> 00:41:09,113
- Wynonna...
- We gave up.

766
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,070
- We stopped looking for her.
- Wynonna.

767
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:16,821
We don't know anything for sure.

768
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:19,157
There could be 1000 reasons why

769
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:21,326
Peacemaker worked in
her hand, you hear me?

770
00:41:23,563 --> 00:41:25,530
Or there's one.

771
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:29,033
♪♪♪

772
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:35,461
Eve?

773
00:41:36,242 --> 00:41:38,142
Come on.

774
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:40,111
You're coming home with me.

779

Hey.

780
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:10,808
So, listen, you gave Doc a car and...

781
00:42:11,588 --> 00:42:12,644
Well, the thing is that
when you give someone a car...

782
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,579
Not now.

783
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,012
It's alright.

784
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:20,152
This is one of the
women we helped today.

785
00:42:20,795 --> 00:42:22,787
I said she could crash here for a while.

786
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:25,558
Waverly, this is...

787
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:27,759
Would you girls kindly get
your butts in here and...

788
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,118
(bottle shattering)

789
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:32,697
Willa.

790
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:34,799
(intense music)
