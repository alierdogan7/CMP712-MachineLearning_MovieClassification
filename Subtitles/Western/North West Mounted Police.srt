1
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,038
The Canadian Northwest.

2
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,162
Here the first traders
from the Old World

3
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:07,524
intermarried with the lndians
of the plains and forests

4
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:11,204
to found a new race:
the Metis of Canada.

5
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:15,642
Here, for two centuries these
half-breed hunters and trappers

6
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:19,841
multiplied and prospered
a law unto themselves.

7
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,400
Then surveyors and homebuilders
pushed westward

8
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,557
bringing laws of land
and property

9
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:28,923
which threatened to end forever

10
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:31,841
the free ways of the wild trails.

11
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:37,362
ln 1885, resentful and confused,
the half-breeds,

12
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:41,839
under the leadership of Louis Riel,
revolted against the advance

13
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,241
of unwelcome law.

14
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:47,280
ln that hour, a handful
of hard riding men

15
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,837
in scarlet coats,
the Northwest Mounted Police,

16
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,083
stood between Canada's destiny

17
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:57,566
and the rebellion that was being
kindled across the American border

18
00:02:58,007 --> 00:02:59,406
in a little Montana school house.

19
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:03,241
Three cheers for
the red, white and blue.

20
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:07,242
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

21
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:11,476
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

22
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,755
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.

23
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:19,841
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

24
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,242
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

25
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:28,321
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

26
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:32,521
Thy banners make tyranny tremble.

27
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:36,521
Three cheers for the red,
white and blue.

28
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,805
Susie, you didn't sing
the last words.

29
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:43,084
l got scared, Mr.Riel.

30
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:46,398
He kind of looks like the big
bad robber in the picture books.

31
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,716
l'm going to let you all
go home early today children.

32
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:53,482
-School dismissed!
-Bye, Mr.Riel!

33
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,325
Susie! Come here.

34
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:02,079
There's nothing to frighten you.
These are old friends from Canada.

35
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,477
Get the kid out!
Time is short.

36
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:09,915
-Run along. Don't imagine things.
-Alright. l'll sing good tomorrow.

37
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,803
You're not gonna be here tomorrow.

38
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:21,760
l got your message, Duroc.
Returning to Canada is death.

39
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,163
For some maybe, not for us.

40
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:27,001
15 years of exile
haven't changed you Corbeau.

41
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,278
Or you... l hope.

42
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:37,960
Canada change plenty. No more
she belong to the half-breed.

43
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:41,923
The law come on the old trails,
white people steal the land,

44
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:44,557
the surveyor tell us
where we got to live.

45
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:48,435
We send plenty letter to government.
She is too busy to listen.

46
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,918
Government take care of lndians,
take care of white settler.

47
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,596
Ain't nobody take care
of the half-breed people.

48
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:58,167
No half-breed gonna take
care of himself.

49
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:04,005
She's gonna fight by Jove.
You gotta come back, and lead us.

50
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:06,683
-Against the Queen's soldiers?
-Yes.

51
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,202
-We tried that once.
-This time it will be different.

52
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:10,886
The lndians are in grand council.

53
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:13,880
More Black Feet and Cree
than anybody ever saw before.

54
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:16,284
They'll join us if l say so,
and fight.

55
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:19,360
l got Cree blood,
same as Big Bear.

56
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,600
-The lndian government...
-What? You and me,

57
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:27,079
and Duroc, we will be the government.
With the lndians,

58
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,358
we'll wipe the whites out
of Western Canada.

59
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:33,156
We'll set up a new government.
Batoche gonna be our capital.

60
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:37,918
Half-breeds coming there by hundreds
from the river and woods,...

61
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,677
-They still believe in me...
-Yeah.

62
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:49,279
You know what happens
if we fail again?

63
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:51,316
We don't fail!

64
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:55,683
Corbeau's got something.
You've never seen a gun like that.

65
00:05:55,807 --> 00:05:58,401
She squirt lead like a hurricane.

66
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,641
Trust Corbeau to know
the newest way of killing.

67
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,998
-My gun shoots 1000 slugs a minute.
-lmpossible.

68
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:07,846
A Gatling gun stole near
the border.

69
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,640
-Blood.
-Put on the dunce cap.

70
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,526
-l go fight alone. Come on!
-No!

71
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,398
l will never let you lead my people.

72
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,876
You can be the saint
that leads them Louis.

73
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:21,040
All l want is the whiskey business.
And l'll get it.

74
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,165
Or you'll get no help
from the lndians.

75
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:24,806
l don't want no help
from a whiskey trader.

76
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,918
-You...!
-Corbeau!

77
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:35,365
Louis, if he don't get
the Cree and Black Feet

78
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,400
to fight those redcoats with us,
we go smash.

79
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,603
And the half-breeds,
they don't fight without Louis.

80
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:43,760
So maybe you don't like each other

81
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,884
but you need each other very much.

82
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,716
Blood will run like water.

83
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:58,357
Blood? You won't notice it much.
The mounted police wear red coats.

84
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,837
Looks like bargain day
in Batoche.

85
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:29,956
Trouble... Keep your eyes open
and holster closed.

86
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,116
Left turn!
Present arms!

87
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:42,200
Present the arms!

88
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:47,325
Soldier, what for
you don't do what l say?

89
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:48,996
l go home.

90
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:52,677
Duroc, he's a go home.

91
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:56,280
Hey! Why you go home?

92
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:01,397
''Shoulder arm, hold arm,
right, left, right about,...''

93
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:05,840
He change his mind too much.
l go home.

94
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,918
Go home? Get back.

95
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,285
All you men obey the order.

96
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,640
-Come here!
-Red coats!

97
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:20,957
Johnny Pelang, dismiss the men.
Get the paper.

98
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:24,637
-Good boy.
-Shoulder the arms!

99
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:29,845
Redcoats coming, we dismiss now.
Go away, but don't leave.

100
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:46,443
You suppose the inspector's right
and Riel is back?

101
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:48,165
The inspector's always right.

102
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,839
-The fort's 20 miles away.
-Dry up.

103
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:03,124
-Where did they get those revolvers?
-Santa Claus.

104
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,116
The police.
Cover up quick.

105
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,360
Hello, Freddie Monts.

106
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,759
Pretty heavy lunch box
you got there.

107
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,801
She's just a little present
for my wife.

108
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:28,124
Be careful she's not your widow.

109
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,400
-Brave man to give his wife bullets.
-Stow that.

110
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,325
There are men here all the way
from the Parsnip. They mean business.

111
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,923
Fort Carlton tonight,
same place.

112
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:11,996
Ronnie.

113
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:18,196
l told you to forget that klootch.
She's poison.

114
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:20,284
-But Jim l...
-Never trust a blue eyed squaw.

115
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,599
There's the old wolf himself.

116
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,999
Go to hospital and call on
your sister. Stay there until l come.

117
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:42,124
-Don't come on a stretcher.
-Sharp now.

118
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:55,084
-Hello, Jim.
-Hello, Dan. Quite a crowd.

119
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:59,197
Sure. Plenty friends of mine.

120
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:07,400
-ls Louis Riel here yet?
-He is the best friend we got.

121
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:10,123
Better advise him to go slow.

122
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:14,436
For 15 years we go slow.
Now we go quick.

123
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,245
We give you 24 hours.

124
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,162
On this paper we write what we want.

125
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:25,835
lf your government say no,
we make new government.

126
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,440
You're making a mistake.

127
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:33,241
-The law is in the Northwest now.
-So is this fellow.

128
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,322
You can't fight the whole
British empire?

129
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:44,680
50 mounted police, only 50.
ln all Canada, only 500.

130
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,243
We got many thousand half-breed.

131
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,641
Big Bear and Crow foot
got 10,000 warrior.

132
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,838
The lndians won't follow Riel.

133
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,198
Maybe they follow Jacques Corbeau.

134
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:01,164
lf you bring back that killer
you'll deserve what you get.

135
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,080
You're a great old wolf, Duroc.

136
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,439
l'd hate to see you
hang with that coyote.

137
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:08,724
-24 hour Jim, we want answer.
-You'll get it,

138
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,645
if the wires to Ottawa stay up.

139
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:15,405
The wires, she'll stay up.
Just 24 hours.

140
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,882
Don't get them tangled
around your neck.

141
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,877
-You think Corbeau no come, eh?
-He will if he smells blood.

142
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:25,884
Maybe he smell blood
pretty quick.

143
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,601
Your blood!

144
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,036
Pull him down!
We're gonna fight!

145
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,125
lf we want Corbeau,
we'll be getting Corbeau.

146
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:39,520
The redcoat be skinned
pretty easy.

147
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:42,242
lf we want Riel,
we'll get Riel!

148
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,920
-Didn't Jim ask you to stay here?
-Yes but...

149
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:49,561
Take your hand off that bridle!

150
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,880
Stand clear.
Let go of that bridle!

151
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:08,325
Shorty! lt's a boy!
A boy Shorty!

152
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,159
Don't you want to see your son?

153
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,557
A boy! Hang loose!

154
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:15,076
Out of the way!
My son he ask for see me.

155
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:17,283
Good for him!

156
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,077
Tod McDuff!
l just have baby!

157
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:27,276
Remarkable.

158
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:30,602
-Hello, Tod.
-Hey, Jim.

159
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,155
Thanks for keeping Shorty covered,
but l'm glad you didn't shoot.

160
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:37,036
l was of a mind too
but l was afraid l'd drop a stitch.

161
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:44,602
She not very big.
How you make sure that's boy?

162
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,881
Black Chief.
That's chief.

163
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,000
Look, Jim.
l just got baby boy!

164
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:56,126
That's a fine papoose.

165
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:01,157
l've got to tell my wife
about this.

166
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,441
-Hello, April.
-Hi.

167
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:08,724
l'll have to get Shorty's baby
a rattle for that timing.

168
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,922
The baby arrived hours ago.

169
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:14,482
-Then you get the rattle.
-You rattle me enough as it is.

170
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:17,445
Hold still Niska.
Roll up my sleeve Ekawe.

171
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,556
l will.

172
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:22,201
How can you deliver a baby,
set a broken leg and look

173
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,323
lovelier than a Christmas
calendar all at once?

174
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,837
You're quite a picture yourself,
you'd look good in a golf frame.

175
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:31,603
-Better in the same frame.
-Let's make it a family album.

176
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,917
Let's water the horses. We must
get Duroc's message on the wire.

177
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,036
Right.

178
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:39,921
When you look at Ronnie even
his hair stands to attention.

179
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:41,765
There's a contrary streak
in the Logan breed.

180
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:45,004
-We just know our own minds.
-You don't know your own heart?

181
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,566
-l don't intent to listen to it.
-You will.

182
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:54,357
You're leg will be just as straight
as sergeant Bret's back.

183
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,120
-Tell you what our plans are...
-Jim!

184
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:58,279
l've been transferred to
Nova Scotia.

185
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:00,715
Nova Scotia?

186
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,841
What's that's where
codfish grow, isn't it?

187
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:10,157
Orders are orders
in my branch of the service too.

188
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:13,797
Niska! You mustn't eat that.
Your tummy will turn to stone.

189
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,406
Like your heart.

190
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:21,321
-l just don't understand.
-You'll never understand Jim.

191
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:25,004
Until something
beats you to your knees.

192
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:28,438
Don't get yourself
all over plastered.

193
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:30,525
-You love me.
-You see?

194
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,524
You don't ask.
You just make statements.

195
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,598
Well, do you love me?

196
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:38,316
l might but l don't want to.

197
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,000
Help me, will you?

198
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:45,842
You're fine and right for yourself
and for the service but

199
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:50,163
-anyway, l'm leaving.
-Running away?

200
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,758
-l'm no heroine.
-All Anglican nurses are heroines.

201
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,726
l don't want to be bravely
smiling goodbye to my husband

202
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,367
every time he puts down
a rebellion or

203
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,400
goes on patrol to the North Pole.
l just wouldn't let him.

204
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:05,875
When do you leave?

205
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,797
-Next month.
-We'll see.

206
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:14,044
Anything in the regulations about
you always getting your woman?

207
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,959
No, but there should be.

208
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,076
l gave the horses some water.

209
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:27,962
Have some yourself.
l'll be there in a minute.

210
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,756
l wish you'd think what it
means to us if you leave.

211
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,323
l'll have plenty of time
to think in Nova Scotia.

212
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:38,317
Sure. What's time to a codfish?

213
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,476
But l'll track you.
To Nova Scotia, Afghanistan...

214
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:47,156
or anywhere, because l still
think we belong in the same frame.

215
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,320
Niska, do you think l'm a fool?

216
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:00,196
So do l.

217
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:03,836
You'll make somebody
a good wife someday.

218
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,602
ln the meantime we'll need you
as a Mounted Police scout.

219
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:09,283
Duroc is my very good friend.

220
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:13,082
Nearly every night for 30 years
we've played pinnacle together.

221
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:14,960
You can't be on both sides.

222
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:18,957
McDuff, you don't scout
for the Redcoats?

223
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:25,160
-You don't turn against me.
-My father was a Highlander.

224
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:28,998
They helped knit the Empire together
and l'll have no hand in

225
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,885
unraveling it.

226
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:34,319
The inspector will swear you in
at Fort Carlton in the morning Tod.

227
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,245
24 hours Jim.

228
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:44,564
You and me,
like brothers Tod.

229
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:49,637
Aye, that we are.
But l cannot fight against the Queen.

230
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:54,685
Flesh of the snake.
Blood of the skunk!

231
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:12,044
You don't fight with us,
maybe you don't fight with nobody.

232
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:15,315
lt would twist my soul
to fight against you Dan.

233
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,722
But l cannot fight
against the Queen.

234
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:51,476
-Jerry.
-Yes?

235
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,642
Cover up for me after mess.
l've gotta get out.

236
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:58,325
Next time tell that klootch
to bring a friend.

237
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,366
Ottawa can't possibly act
on these demands in 24 hours.

238
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,482
B0 atoche will boil over
and scald half of Canada.

239
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,316
Rotten business.

240
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:14,043
lf the lndians rise they'll be
blood from here to Baffin Bay.

241
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,164
Come on!
Gates closing for the night!

242
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:19,279
Everybody out.
Civilians outside the stockade!

243
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:22,764
Get going, Uncle Blue Owl.

244
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:27,324
-Come on. Come on.
-Hurry it up there.

245
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:29,479
Hurry it up.

246
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,125
-Where can l find the head man?
-Headquarters over there.

247
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:40,643
Keep moving. Everyone out.

248
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,236
Hey you!

249
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,400
Who's that? Gabriel?

250
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,203
No civilians allowed in
the stockade after retreat, mister.

251
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:02,006
-You'll have to come back tomorrow.
-Thanks.

252
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:07,035
Hold him for me, will you soldier?
He's part bull and don't like red.

253
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,479
A man from Texas, sir.

254
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,002
My name's Dusty Rivers sir,
Texas Rangers.

255
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,485
l landed up here following
a man we're after for murder.

256
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,723
Orderly, tell sergeant Bret
l want him.

257
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:30,996
Yes, sir.

258
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:32,961
Ranger's commission.

259
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:37,683
Commissioner's deputy,
United States Marshal

260
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:41,480
and here's my O.K.
from your Regina office.

261
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:48,121
-l've heard of your organization.
-Thanks. We heard of yours too.

262
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:50,956
Thank you.

263
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,965
You come at rather a difficult time.

264
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:57,037
Sergeant Bret, this is Mr. Rivers
of the Texas Rangers.

265
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,196
Howdy.

266
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,160
Texas did you say?

267
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,318
-Texas, is a United State.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:05,684
The Rangers are a organization
rather like our own

269
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:07,886
in some respects.

270
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:12,316
Yes, sir.

271
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,086
He's here on a police errand.

272
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:17,239
See that he's fed, billeted,
and offered a bath.

273
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,884
Then help him fill out
the proper forms.

274
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:21,836
Very good, sir.

275
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,525
That's mighty hospitable of you
but l want to get started...

276
00:21:25,647 --> 00:21:26,716
This way please.

277
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:33,920
They say Riel
is gonna try it again.

278
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:35,156
Look out, l'm not Riel.

279
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:37,847
l tried a lot of times
l never got anywhere.

280
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:48,439
-Low bridge there Slim.
-Place wasn't built for a giraffe.

281
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:52,796
Gentlemen!

282
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:55,882
This is Mr. Rivers of
the Texas constabulary.

283
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,283
-Rangers.
-Hello, constable!

284
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:02,245
Another criminal has leaked out
of the US and he's after him.

285
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,963
You can sleep in that
collapsible mantrap, sheriff.

286
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,240
Attention, to roll call.

287
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:11,795
-Constable Ackroyd.
-Here.

288
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:13,280
-Adams.
-Cameron.

289
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,159
-Douglass.
-Fyffe.

290
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:16,960
-Herrick.
-Judson.

291
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,486
-Kent.
-Kennedy.

292
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,121
-On patrol.
-Harder than rock but for your head.

293
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,760
-Lane.
-Logan.

294
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:25,796
Logan?

295
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,521
He was slightly overheated
and went out to get some air.

296
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,476
Ronnie!

297
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:45,596
-Why you be so late?
-l was put on potato patrol.

298
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:49,318
lf this potato is other woman...

299
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,280
l eat your heart out.

300
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:54,960
l was pealing one million potatoes

301
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,163
just because l talked
to you in Batoche.

302
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:00,196
Then maybe l don't eat your heart.

303
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,604
l just keep him here,
inside my heart.

304
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:05,041
Suits me molasses.

305
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:10,124
-Here. Want this for a padlock?
-Ronnie!

306
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:17,041
This lock both our hearts together.

307
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,446
Put it on for me please.

308
00:23:25,727 --> 00:23:26,716
What's that?

309
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:38,756
Get!

310
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,083
lf that wicked sentry finds you

311
00:23:56,207 --> 00:23:58,198
your cute little pelt
will be nailed to the barn door.

312
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:04,199
Ronnie, maybe police
no let me come Fort no more.

313
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,200
-Why?
-My father, he come back.

314
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:10,561
Who's your father?

315
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,446
He's very bad medicine.

316
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:17,717
l remember long ago
he cooked bear meat on stick

317
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,799
give me piece in my hand.

318
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,246
Well l'll tell you
what we'll do.

319
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,843
l won't bite him
if he doesn't bite me.

320
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:30,996
Please,

321
00:24:32,047 --> 00:24:34,163
you don't let my father
bust us up!

322
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:41,082
Listen you little wild cat.
You're the only real thing for me.

323
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:46,476
Nobody, nothing could ever
make me let you go.

324
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:51,885
l love you so terrible bad
l feel good.

325
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:57,005
l'll be pealing potatoes
the rest of my life for this.

326
00:24:57,927 --> 00:25:00,316
-Douglass, a hand will you?
-Of course.

327
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,876
Mother and child,
both doing nicely.

328
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,639
What do you ride in Texas?
Elephants?

329
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:07,875
They come in handy if you
break a wheel on your wagon.

330
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:10,165
An uncle of mine visited Texas once.

331
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:12,283
Sir William Wade,
perhaps you've met him.

332
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:15,317
We hung a fellow
named Bill Wade.

333
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:17,286
That probably was not Sir William.

334
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:18,436
No!

335
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:21,484
Advise me what time Logan get in.

336
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,757
Good night Sheriff.
Revelly is at six o'clock.

337
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,599
-Re- what?
-Oh Revelly.

338
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:30,965
You fellows are pretty fancy!

339
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:34,086
Having ltalian food for breakfast.

340
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,717
Doesn't your organization
rise by bugle call?

341
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:41,919
Sure! We blow Rev...
Oh! You mean Revelry.

342
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:45,601
lt's been waking him up every
morning and he can't pronounce it.

343
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:48,924
Any more than you can eat it.
We'll get your man for you.

344
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:52,001
l was counting on being
home by the 4th of July.

345
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:57,526
-Your birthday?
-No, my Uncle Sam's.

346
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:59,126
lt's an American holiday.

347
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,040
Yeah. The States sort of set up
housekeeping for themselves.

348
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:04,960
After being hatched
and protected for 150 years.

349
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:08,239
-Don't mind him. He reads a lot.
-We stuck to our mother, that's all.

350
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,484
lt's a wise child that
knows its own mother.

351
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:14,560
A wiser one that appreciates her.
Good night Sheriff.

352
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:17,636
Good night.

353
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:22,606
But l still want to be home
by the 4th of July.

354
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:24,998
Have your saddles ready for
marching orders in the morning.

355
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:26,561
There may be action.

356
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:29,122
-Lights out. Good night.
-Good night.

357
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:30,999
Action tomorrow. You hear that?

358
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:33,556
Look, he's a Redcoat at heart.

359
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,524
ls that the Rangers full dress?

360
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,605
Undress.

361
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:40,076
Very good!

362
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:43,404
Why do you carry two guns?

363
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,803
One don't shoot far enough.

364
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:50,556
-l'd like to visit Texas some day.
-You can.

365
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:53,880
Canadians get over to our
country too once in a while.

366
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:56,959
l'm after one of 'em now.

367
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:00,958
-Good night.
-Good night.

368
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:02,596
Good night.

369
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,686
That second red river cart
looks like it had the mumps.

370
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:34,125
Wait. l'll talk to them.

371
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,964
-Good afternoon.
-How do you do?

372
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:41,761
What's in the carts?

373
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:46,836
-Take a look. lf you want.
-No, you have no warrant.

374
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,244
These aren't ordinary times, mister.

375
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:57,197
Rare wheels for a red river cart.

376
00:27:57,607 --> 00:28:00,804
Open it up! Come along!
Pull the hide off.

377
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,359
Holy cat! Look at this!

378
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:19,239
Why did you do that?
We could have taken them prisoner.

379
00:28:19,927 --> 00:28:21,997
There was no need to shed blood.

380
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,517
You're splattered with it too, Louis.

381
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:27,638
You can't back out now.

382
00:28:30,607 --> 00:28:32,837
Get going!
Advance!

383
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:36,640
Get up there! Come on!

384
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:51,799
-Well?
-No word yet sir.

385
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:57,603
Fur!
Buy from me please.

386
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:00,477
-You buy these white ermines?
-No!

387
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:03,041
Buy from me please.

388
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,643
Furs. You buy these
pretty white ermines?

389
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:11,085
What l got here is
very fine, very young.

390
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:14,037
What you got is the oldest
thing there is,

391
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:17,119
only the original sale
was for an apple not a fur.

392
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:19,758
l no sell this for apple.

393
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:25,317
Stranger! l wouldn't buy
any furs from that Beelzebub!

394
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:27,723
-She steals them!
-You tell lie!

395
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:31,200
Somagun Scotch lndian!

396
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,925
-l think l kill you.
-Heathen.

397
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:37,561
l'll take you across my knee
and tan your hide.

398
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:40,002
-l kill you!
-Oh you would!

399
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,522
Let go my hair! Let go!

400
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:49,195
l'll get you for this!

401
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,524
-l'll skin you for this!
-You're gonna get it!

402
00:29:58,927 --> 00:29:59,916
Let me go!

403
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,956
Take her hands off her
or l'll beat your teeth out!

404
00:30:06,327 --> 00:30:07,316
Logan!

405
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,204
Tod, report to the OC.
He'll swear you in.

406
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:15,966
Aye Him. Daughter of Beelzabub,
l know how to handle a woman.

407
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:19,841
l told you to keep away
from this fort.

408
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:24,361
Pretty soon
you'll no be boss no more.

409
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,636
Get out of here!

410
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:28,958
Wait a minute!
Where did you get that ring?

411
00:30:30,087 --> 00:30:31,315
What you care?

412
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,686
Logan, l want to talk to you.

413
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,204
l warned you about that klootch.

414
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:48,122
-My personal business is my own.
-She's a thieving little...

415
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,885
l ought to wipe your jaw for that.

416
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:51,476
Don't be a fool.

417
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:56,197
-lt's because she's part lndian.
-No! Because she's all bad.

418
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,517
You'd lose your eyebrows
if l married her, wouldn't you?

419
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,604
-Why?
-Why not?

420
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:04,443
-l don't see why all this...
-Do you know who she is?

421
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,880
-l know who she's going to be.
-She's Jacques Corbeau's daughter.

422
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:11,163
Look out!

423
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,156
lt's April!

424
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:22,875
What happened?

425
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:24,721
Call the hospital orderlies.

426
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:26,200
Get the doctor!
Put that man out there.

427
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:28,318
Take this one first.
He's dead.

428
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:31,320
-Corporal take charge of the body.
-Dr. Roberts. This way sir!

429
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:33,802
-There's two of them in there.
-Gently, he's badly hurt.

430
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:36,200
-Who is it?
-l don't know!

431
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:38,524
Corporal!
Clear these people.

432
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,718
-Come on!
-Let Miss Logan through!

433
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:50,320
How'd it happen?

434
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:53,846
Constable Fenton.

435
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:56,199
-Where did you find him?
-On the Red Berry trail.

436
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:57,766
l was on my way to a case.

437
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:02,717
How long were they lying
there before you found them?

438
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,602
-lt happened just before l got there.
-Did you hear firing?

439
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:10,324
-Did you see any tracks?
-Some red river cart tracks.

440
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:11,960
l couldn't tell how many horses.

441
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:15,357
-What Fenton able to say anything?
-He said something about a gun but...

442
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:17,205
Constable Fenton, what happened?

443
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:21,599
Wagon train, sir...

444
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:23,996
Carrying a...

445
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:26,036
Gatling gun.

446
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:30,198
-A Gatling gun?
-Somebody running guns to Duroc.

447
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:33,326
-Did you recognize the men?
-No, sir.

448
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:38,486
But funny foreign looking saddle.

449
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,606
Fenton,

450
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:43,278
can you describe the saddle?

451
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,077
Did it have a big silver horn?

452
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:48,436
Biggest

453
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,325
l ever saw.

454
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,926
What the boy saw was
a Mexican charro saddle.

455
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:58,246
Probably ridden by the man
l'm after, Jacques Corbeau.

456
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:00,076
Corbeau?

457
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:02,965
Have the bugle sound
boots and saddles.

458
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,964
-Patrol of 20 men.
-Yes, sir.

459
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,721
Good job Miss Logan.
Better stay at the fort.

460
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,122
Batoche is not safe.

461
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:12,437
Thank you but l have several
patients in my hospital.

462
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:17,246
l wish l was one of them...

463
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,319
-Boots and saddles!
-Come on!

464
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:39,755
No member of the force shall discuss
the situation with any civilian,

465
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,445
except in being in the
regular line of duty.

466
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,996
Alright. Bedrolls and kit bags
on the wagons at once!

467
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:46,760
Don't let the grass grow under you.
Come on!

468
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:50,199
On the double.
Get 'em out there.

469
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:54,605
Pick 'em up. They won't bite.

470
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,644
Be sure you put that
on the horse Logan.

471
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:00,080
-One keg of horseshoes.
-Right.

472
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,437
Don't forget the nails this time.
You can't sew them on.

473
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:03,966
-Right.
-And an extra wagon pole.

474
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:05,998
-That breaks you'll pull it yourself.
-Right.

475
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:08,039
One coil of rope.

476
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,277
You boys can sure slap
a saddle on pronto.

477
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,637
Come on!
On the double!

478

-Thank you.

482

00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:09,919
-They're pretty good, aren't they?
-They're the best.

485
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,202
-My name's Dusty Rivers.
-lsn't that a contradiction?

486
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:21,159

been to Texas, Miss...

487
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,205
-Miss...?
-April Logan.

488
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:28,320
-April? You're not fooling?
-No.

489
00:35:28,487 --> 00:35:29,806
Here's your horse, sergeant.

490
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,963
Head 'em out.

496
00:35:58,247 --> 00:35:59,600
Make much of your horses!

497
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:04,044
April, l'd rather you didn't
go back to the town.

498
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:06,198
Sergeant, what part of
the parade do l ride in?

499
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:07,880
l'm sorry,

500
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,157
-April, with Riel on the warpath.
-l'm sorry too,

501
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:14,438
-but l am going with you.
-Corbeau is wanted for murder here.

502
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:16,240
He belongs
to the Mounted Police now.

503
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:19,237
He belongs to whoever
catches him first.

504
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:22,879
Hi, sis'!
Let your brother kiss you goodbye.

505

l'll be glad to tend to any
unfinished chores for you.

507
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,837
There are some things about
you that l don't like.

508
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:34,521
-You're not exactly perfection.
-This isn't Texas...

509
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:38,845
Jim! l think l'm capable of deciding
who l'll kiss goodbye.

510
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,286
l'm not sure that you are.

511
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,000
-You ought to obey him.
-Do you?

512
00:36:51,647 --> 00:36:54,923
-Not always.
-Your judgment's good enough for me.

513
00:36:58,367 --> 00:37:01,439
-Patrol all present, sergeant.
-Very good.

514
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:08,359
-Patrol ready to march, sir.
-Pick up the trail at the scene.

515
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:10,325
lt'll probably take you
to Big Bear's camp.

516
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:12,802
-Yes sir. March them off.
-Very good sir.

517
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:14,686
March!
March!

518
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:17,799
Sections right!
Right!

519
00:37:18,887 --> 00:37:20,445
Wire from Headquarters, sir.

520
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,235
Sergeant Bret!

521
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:26,676
Patrol halt!

522
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:33,200
-Dismiss you men, sergeant.
-Beg your pardon, sir?

523
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:35,398
-Dismiss your men.
-Very good, sir.

524
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:40,444
-Sergeant Field, take over!
-What the..

525
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:41,676
Dismiss the patrol.

526
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,760
Sections left about!

527
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:48,158
-What's up?
-We're staying here.

528
00:37:48,447 --> 00:37:51,007
Not me, amigo.
l'm gonna get Corbeau.

529
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,201
lf you ride through that gate
l'll place you under arrest.

530
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,443
-You can try.
-Sergeant!

531
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:01,084
lnspector's complements: Will you,
Mr. Rivers and McDuff report at once.

532
00:38:09,007 --> 00:38:10,486
Change of orders from Regina.

533
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:13,241
No patrols to leave until we're
reinforced by Colonel lrvine.

534
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:17,600
lt'll take a week. By then Corbeau
will have Big Bear on the warpath.

535
00:38:17,727 --> 00:38:18,716
And the Black feet.

536
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:20,365
-Couldn't you wire Regina?
-No!

537
00:38:20,727 --> 00:38:23,639
The wires were cut two minutes
after this came through.

538
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:26,637
Does the order prohibit
sending out a single scout?

539
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:29,556
No.

540
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,605
l'd like your permission to proceed
to Big Bear's camp alone

541
00:38:32,887 --> 00:38:37,517
-and try to keep him loyal.
-No! Only a loon would do it.

542
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:42,077
lt's a ticklish job,
but permission is granted.

543
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:43,881
l'll leave at once, sir.

544
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,526
l'll leave at the same time.

545
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:53,640
l'd be grateful if you'd
bind and gag this Texan.

546
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:57,523
-l'm not going where he is.
-Where do you want to go?

547
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:00,277
l figured to pick up Corbeau
in Batoche.

548
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:04,159
-Why do you think he's there?
-That's Riel's capital, isn't it?

549
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,517
You can't make an arrest in Canada.

550
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:11,442
lf l got to have a nurse...
give me the Scotchman.

551
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:14,476
McDuff, you'll
accompany Mr. Rivers.

552
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:19,041
And gentlemen
l hope you keep your scalps.

553
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,677
A nurse, at my time of life...

554
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,846
-Good hunting.
-Thanks.

555
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,398
-Sure you make that fast.
-Alright miss.

556
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:35,126
Climb aboard McDuff.

557
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,405
-Where are you going?
-Batoche.

558
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:43,875
-l wish it was 1000 miles.
-Seat's too hard for 20 miles.

559
00:39:44,287 --> 00:39:47,279
Lady, to me it's just
like sitting on a cloud.

560
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:49,556
Get!

561
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:59,081
-Are you riding with us Jim?
-No. The other way.

562
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,321
l'll send you a postcard.

563
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:42,205
Canada is a lot different
from what l expected.

564
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:43,316
The scenery?

565
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:47,560
-No, the people.
-Haven't had much time to tell.

566
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:50,243
Sometimes it strikes you
at first sight...

567
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:53,126
l mean...

568
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:57,561
You can usually figure a man
by the way he handles his horse

569
00:40:58,047 --> 00:40:59,366
but women are different.

570
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,167
What did you expect
Canadian women to be like?

571
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:07,278
Like the scenery:
good to look at but kind of frostbitten.

572
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:10,799
But you're not.

573
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,161
l've always understood Americans

574
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:17,120
were too busy building,
and selling and shooting each other

575
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:19,198
to waste time saying
nice things to women.

576
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:23,963
-We get around to it now and then.
-Must be appreciated by your wife.

577
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:26,678
-Who's wife?
-Aren't you married?

578
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,476
l've always held that
a bachelor is a fellow who

579
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:32,398
never makes
the same mistake once.

580
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:34,436
You believe that?

581
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:37,640
l did... until mighty recent.

582
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:47,844
Do you think a plant from up here
would do alright in Texas?

583
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:50,326
l don't know Texas.

584
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:54,724
Even the moonlight's warm and soft
along the Pecos River.

585
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:59,435
Do you have fast horses
in Texas Mr. Rivers?

586
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:01,566
The fastest in the world.

587
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,403
Betting they cannot
keep up with the men?

588
00:42:10,247 --> 00:42:11,236
Look!

589
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:22,726
-What happened, Mrs. Burns?
-Don't go into Batoche.

590
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,202
-They've looted the Trading Post.
-And driven us from our homes.

591
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:28,046
-How could Duroc permit it?
-He tried to keep order but...

592
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,646
when Corbeau got there...

593
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:31,076
-Corbeau?
-Yes.

594
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:33,996
Excuse me, lady.

595
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:41,284
Enough!
Just one thing more.

596
00:42:42,967 --> 00:42:45,197
Riel can tell you how this
new government sets up.

597
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,558
But l'll tell you how
it's going to win.

598
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:50,635
10,000 lndians turn loose
on Saskatchewan.

599
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:54,476
They'll be nobody left to pull
down this government

600
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:55,716
when l'm finished.

601
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:04,597
Canadian woman
who has so sweet the eyes,

602
00:43:04,847 --> 00:43:08,920
who has so sweet the eyes,
who has so sweet the eyes,

603
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:12,921
who has so sweet the eyes,
who has so sweet the eyes,

604
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:15,076
Gentlemen,

605
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:19,159
Corbeau has promised you
the backing of Big Bear.

606
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:23,358
When Big Bear leads
the Cree nation upon the war path

607
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:25,958
the Black Feet will rise with him.

608
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,756
Our fire of wrath will
consume its oppressors.

609
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,238
From it will arise,
not half-breed,

610
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:42,604
but a free and
independent Metis nation.

611
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,599
Don't mind me, mister.
Go right ahead.

612
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:51,441
Duroc, who is he?

613
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,917
He's officer from United States.

614
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:56,158
Want talk with Canada Government.

615
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,520
l bring him here.

616
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:06,158
They found out quick.

617
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:11,476
Hey!

618
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:16,996
l'm a Deputy US Marshal, Mr. Riel

619
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:18,600
-And...
-You know my name.

620
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:22,518
Sure! Who don't?
Here's my credentials.

621
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:27,486
We'd be happy to know
if your new government

622
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:30,440
means to work hand in hand
with the United States.

623
00:44:31,207 --> 00:44:34,722
The Metis of Canada will be happy
to cooperate with the USA.

624
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:38,443
Suppose some fellow commits
a crime in our country

625
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:40,279
then trails up here to hide out.

626
00:44:41,247 --> 00:44:45,001
We'll help you in every way
just as we hope you will help us.

627
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:46,806
That's fine because

628
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:50,839
l got a warrant here for the arrest
of a man named Jacques Corbeau.

629
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:55,041
On a charge of murder.

630
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,036
Gentlemen!

631
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:06,161
Council is recessed.

632
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:09,356
Wait here.

633
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:18,481
That put a bee in Riel's bonnet.

634
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:24,366
-This bee on your bonnet.
-What's the matter with it?

635
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:29,284
-My first bullet shoots him off.
-Why you wanna ruin my bonnet?

636
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:32,999
Just so you know it is me
who fires the second shot.

637
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:35,603
The one that go between your eye.

638
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:39,716
l'll make you a small wager.
50 cents

639
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,842
that l put a bullet through
your vengeful heart

640
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,243
before you shoot the knob
from my bonnet.

641
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:48,877
l take that bet and l take
the money from your pocket

642
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:51,718
because you'll be dead.

643
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:55,158
Corbeau.

644
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:59,962
-There's a US officer here.
-For what?

645
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,159
-You.
-Well?

646
00:46:02,689 --> 00:46:05,157
He wants a warrant from
my government for your arrest.

647
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:09,158
-Why don't you give it to him?
-But we need you for the lndians.

648
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:14,078
ln two hours give him your warrant.
Tell him l'm in Big Bear's camp.

649
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:15,438
He can arrest me there.

650
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:17,685
He would never leave
that camp alive.

651
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:21,319
You don't want him killed here,
do you Louis?

652
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:25,363
At an lndian camp,
who cares?

653
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:38,163
Once the Cree warriors
were free men.

654
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:41,766
Canada belonged to you and to us.

655
00:46:42,449 --> 00:46:44,087
Well it's gonna be ours again.

656
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:46,724
Take the warpath with us.
Fight!

657
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:51,961
Fight like you used to fight,
and not one of these prairie cops

658
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:53,687
will be buried with his scalp on.

659
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:00,399
Big Bear, that medal
you wear is the Queen's.

660
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:04,360
The great white mother who sent
food to you when you starved.

661
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:07,329
You're too wise to let a liar
make bad blood between us.

662
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:11,647
Men say Queen no longer rule us.

663
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:14,205
Redcoat no more our friend.

664
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:18,084
This is our friend that bites
with a thousand teeth of fire.

665
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:25,968
Make gun talk to them.

666
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:29,959
-lt'll tear it to rags.
-Squaw make new lodge.

667
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:32,205
A hole in the tent won't
change the British Empire.

668
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:36,527
This man is going to hang.
l don't want to see you beside him.

669
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,688
Make gun talk.

670
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:50,681
Two more strangers.

671
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:53,284
l want his scalp.

672
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:03,882
l know him.

673
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:09,004
Well you sure found
Corbeau alright.

674
00:48:09,409 --> 00:48:10,888
You're as welcome as a broken leg.

675
00:48:11,409 --> 00:48:15,368
Ahkakito, who these men?

676
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:17,406
Spies to count your men and horses.

677
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:19,844
His tongue is forked.
He said he came alone.

678
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:21,522
This man is no spy.

679
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:25,801
He comes from afar to take
Corbeau who killed in his nation.

680
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:29,320
Like Mounted Police want
Corbeau because he has killed here.

681
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:34,204
Are you afraid of Redcoats?
Their blood spills like other men's.

682
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:37,446
Look here Chief.
Before you turn that man over

683
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:40,806
to the Mounted Police,
l got an order for his arrest

684
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:44,160
not only from the US,
but from his own Chief, Riel.

685
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:45,678
And if you...

686
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:55,003
l'm paid 72 cents a day
to protect dummies like him.

687
00:48:56,289 --> 00:48:57,278
Peace.

688
00:48:58,009 --> 00:48:59,727
We got no war with the Redcoat.

689
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:03,684
Yet. But they
no take away my friend.

690
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:08,080
You both come alone,
you both go alone.

691
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:10,648
l have spoken.

692
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:16,239
Big Bear was a great chief.
His friends will be sorry for him.

693
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:24,728
Now you die.

694
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:30,883
You can kill me and take this back
but its medicine will be gone.

695
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:35,403
The great white mother gave you this
to let you rule over thousands.

696
00:49:36,689 --> 00:49:38,839
You are not chief
unless she gives it back to you.

697
00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:43,439
Big Bear will join his blood
brother and fight for Riel.

698
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:46,678
Go.

699
00:49:48,729 --> 00:49:49,718
Big Bear,

700
00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:51,997
you're a great Chief.

701
00:49:52,249 --> 00:49:54,285
Why we heard of you
way down in Texas.

702
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:56,402
But how do you know
who's the best fighter?

703
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:58,405
The Mounted Police or Corbeau,

704
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:01,041
the great killer of men?

705
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:02,602
-You better get out.
-Rivers.

706
00:50:02,729 --> 00:50:04,287
Peace. Talk.

707
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:08,765
Why this fellow's killed in Texas,
and killed in Canada.

708
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:13,562
He must be a great gunfighter,
but have you ever seen him kill?

709
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,846
How do you know
all these yarns are true?

710
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:17,721
l'll show you if they're true.

711
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:22,281
He offers to show you.
Let him kill now.

712
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:25,237
Who he kill?

713
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:27,318
Me.

714
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:32,078
Another will die.

715
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:35,042
Slide my guns back in their cradles,
untie my hands

716
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:36,363
and l'll hold them out.

717
00:50:36,889 --> 00:50:39,528
Then tell this tough man
to go to it.

718
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,962
Cut the thongs.
Put back the guns.

719
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:57,968
-The man is daft.
-He's great!

720
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:02,807
Now tell him to kill.

721
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:08,638
Kill.

722
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:12,601
Go ahead Corbeau. Draw.

723
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,118
Tell him to draw Big Bear.

724
00:51:15,169 --> 00:51:18,798
He's been bragging about how
he's gonna kill? Start on me.

725
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:23,398
Kill.

726
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:27,122
Draw you yellow pole cat!

727
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:31,999
You're a good hand at shooting
men in the back. What's wrong now?.

728
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:42,368
l won't foul a great Chief's lodge
with the blood of a dog.

729
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:47,925
He's yapping across the trail,
to save his Redcoat friends.

730
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:51,605
But the medicine gun,
she'll roll them all in the dirt.

731
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:54,280
l have not seen this yet.

732
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:55,838
Then look.

733
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:14,327
What a thing!

734
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:17,885
That gun strong medicine.

735
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:20,445
Shooting painted horses
is not killing men.

736
00:52:20,729 --> 00:52:22,685
Before the sun has set three times

737
00:52:23,129 --> 00:52:25,120
l'll bring you the Redcoats
of the Mounted Police,

738
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:29,522
made redder with their own blood
and full of holes like a net.

739
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:34,487
You're not a feather to be blown
about by the talk of a coward.

740
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:42,637
Bring me in your hand
their empty coat red with blood

741
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:46,844
before three suns have set

742
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:50,723
and my braves
will take the warpath.

743
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:54,519
Before three suns have set

744
00:52:54,889 --> 00:52:57,323
Corbeau will wear iron
on his hands.

745
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:00,158
Come on!

746
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:18,889
Very nice entertainment indeed.

747
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:22,719
Now if you'll cut me loose l'll
endeavor to show my appreciation.

748
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:26,438
You're alright, Sheriff.
Let's mush.

749
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:29,489
-l came here to get that fellow.
-l think we'd better move

750
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:33,967
before Corbeau finds out the lndians
took the bullets out of your pistols.

751
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,645
l won't tell on you.
Come on.

752
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:57,918
Whatever you did at Big Bear's
camp these men have undone.

753
00:53:58,009 --> 00:53:59,044
What else could we do?

754
00:53:59,129 --> 00:54:00,721
Our horses were stolen
two nights ago.

755
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:04,637
You should have blown it up!
Leaving 10,000 rounds of ammunition

756
00:54:04,729 --> 00:54:06,765
at Duck Lake is inexcusable.

757
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:09,762
When my wife heard the half-breeds
were coming through Duck Lake

758
00:54:10,089 --> 00:54:14,082
on their way to attack Prince Albert,
she grabbed the kid and we left.

759
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:15,682
Thank you. That's all.

760
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:18,727
l didn't think about saving
anything but our scalps.

761
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:24,048
-We're going after that ammunition.
-Very good, sir.

762
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:26,086
But Col. lrvine's relief force
is due shortly.

763
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:29,724
Relief or not, we cannot allow
that ammo to fall into Riel's hand.

764
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:32,278
-l don't like the smell of this.
-What do you mean?

765
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:35,367
l'm curious to learn
where Corbeau plans to find

766
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:38,242
the bullet ridden red coats
he promised Big Bear.

767
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,201
That won't be his first lie.

768
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:41,358
Sergeant.

769
00:54:44,169 --> 00:54:47,684
You will post sentries
commanding Beardy's Basin.

770
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:49,481
That's the only place
we could be ambushed

771
00:54:49,609 --> 00:54:51,008
this side of Duck Lake.

772
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:52,762
There's an old cabin there?

773
00:55:02,649 --> 00:55:03,638
That's the cabin.

774
00:55:04,529 --> 00:55:06,087
See that Basin below you?

775
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:08,724
lf Riel's brigade cuts back from
the Prince Albert road

776
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,401
they'll come through
the river bed there.

777
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:12,839
Each man two hours on watch,
two hours rest.

778
00:55:13,129 --> 00:55:14,847
Two hours on your feet,
and two hours on your back.

779
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:17,599
At the first sign of the enemy
fall back at gallop and report.

780
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:21,284
-All this time the half breed army...
-Moving in the other direction.

781
00:55:21,649 --> 00:55:22,843
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

782
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:27,080
You'll be relieved tomorrow.
Bye. Keep your eyes open.

783
00:55:27,249 --> 00:55:28,398
Same to you.

784
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:54,198
Ekawe!

785
00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:01,447
You fix leg.

786
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:05,804
Come sit in this nice green chair.
Does the cast hurt you?

787
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:11,528
No, you help her good
that's why l help you.

788
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:16,326
-Help me? How?.
-You fix. Don't look at me.

789
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:20,884
Redcoat march for Duck Lake.

790
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:24,758
Half-breed, they wait in wood,
kill Redcoat.

791
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:27,526
But l thought Riel had
marched on Prince Albert.

792
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:29,362
That's just for trick.

793
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:32,966
They make trap
for Redcoat at Duck Lake.

794
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:36,803
An ambush?
With the medicine gun?

795
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:38,438
Yes.

796
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:43,080
Your brother keep watch
on cabin at Beardy's basin.

797
00:56:43,729 --> 00:56:45,606
They gonna kill him tonight.

798
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:49,764
So he don't see them make
what you call ambush.

799
00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:53,558
Ronnie!

800
00:56:54,689 --> 00:56:55,678
Ronnie?

801
00:56:57,809 --> 00:57:01,597
You just trying to scare me.
l don't like you pretty much.

802
00:57:01,729 --> 00:57:03,367
But it's Ronnie who's in danger.

803
00:57:04,009 --> 00:57:08,446
-You think l like him too much?
-lf you like him, you can help him.

804
00:57:09,169 --> 00:57:12,479
What do you mean, like?
l love Ronnie.

805
00:57:15,689 --> 00:57:19,728
That's why you no like me.
You think l'm no good for him.

806
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:23,525
lf you love him,
you'll do as l ask.

807
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:27,479
He's on outpost duty
at the old cabin near Beardy's Basin.

808
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:31,922
Go to him. Tell him to warn
the Police not to march on Duck Lake.

809
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:35,527
-Why don't you go?
-They won't let me leave Batoche.

810
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:36,883
Nobody would stop you.

811
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:40,238
What you think?
Me save police?

812
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:44,201
Pretty soon my father
have all the whiskey business

813
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:46,360
and l wear silk and rings.

814
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:50,361
l think Ronnie like that.

815
00:57:53,009 --> 00:57:55,762
lf you don't warn the Police,
Ronnie will hate you.

816
00:57:56,649 --> 00:58:00,961
Maybe that man you love,
that big sergeant gonna be killed.

817
00:58:02,929 --> 00:58:07,559
Maybe bullet go through
that Scotch lndian.

818
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:09,606
-Louvette.
-Somofagum,

819
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:12,203
you think you better than me,
you go save them.

820
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:15,924
l'm not better than you. lf you
want rings, l'll give them to you.

821
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:18,000
But don't lose anymore time.

822
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:24,923
l beg you on my knees
if that will make you go.

823
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:29,158
Soon medicine gun knock
police on their knees.

824
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:36,681
Maybe tomorrow night the wolf
come for what is left.

825
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:41,767
You say you love Ronnie while
you brazenly sit there eating,

826
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:45,080
knowing he's gonna be killed.
There's nothing in you but hate.

827
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:46,958
You're a savage Louvette.

828
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:50,280
A vicious, cruel savage.
Blood and revenge is all you know,

829
00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:53,089
-not love.
-Hey you!

830
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,400
l'll show you love.

831
00:58:58,129 --> 00:59:00,006
What you want l tell Ronnie?

832
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:02,038
You'll go?

833
00:59:03,529 --> 00:59:04,678
Sure l go.

834
00:59:05,649 --> 00:59:09,688
Tell Ronnie the half breeds
will ambush at Beardy's Basin.

835
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,477
Sure l tell him.
You go home now.

836
00:59:16,649 --> 00:59:19,004
We'll never forget
what you've done for us.

837
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:24,044
No. You won't forget.

838
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:31,125
-What's after you?
-A big bad rabbit.

839
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:33,082
Chased me all the way back.

840
00:59:33,609 --> 00:59:35,884
-Male or female?
-l didn't ask.

841
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:39,958
My tobacco is in the saddle bag.

842
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:44,121
-Steal it sparingly.
-Thank you. l will.

843
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:58,441
You need wife for clean the house.

844
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,318
What in the...

845
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:06,928
What are you doing here?

846
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:12,525
-How'd you know l was here?
-My father is mad on me.

847
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:17,525
-Why?
-He find out l got big love for you.

848
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:20,839
Why didn't you tell me
Corbeau was your father?

849
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:24,401
Tonight he take plenty half breed

850
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:27,239

851
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,567
-But when he come back...
-Answer me...

852
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,160
What do you care
who is my father?

853
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:44,728
You hate Jacques Corbeau
more strong than you love Louvette.

854
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:49,085
l'd be bat brained about you
if your father was the devil himself.

855
01:00:51,089 --> 01:00:53,125
You don't never marry
with me now.

856
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:57,959
Once this is over l'll marry you
quicker than you can say Somagum.

857
01:01:00,249 --> 01:01:01,568
That's too late.

858
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:05,438
Why?

859
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,162
My father gonna kill me
'cause l love Redcoat.

860
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:14,363
We be married tonight
or we don't be married never.

861
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:15,758
Tonight?

862
01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:19,123
lndians shoot priest

863
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:23,567
Now at Batoche, Duroc
he's scared for Father Piccard.

864
01:01:24,569 --> 01:01:27,037
Gonna send him to Regina
when daylight come.

865
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:31,885
Please,
he marry us before he go.

866
01:01:33,009 --> 01:01:37,082
-But l can't leave here.
-Nothing happen here.

867
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:40,240
Why you here for anyway?

868
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:42,918
Orders.

869
01:01:43,729 --> 01:01:46,607
But you be back
before somebody know.

870
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:49,401
Somofagum.

871
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:52,798
l love you so terrible much.

872
01:01:56,169 --> 01:02:00,685
But l'm on duty.
They'd hang me, shoot me,

873
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:02,198
boil me in oil.

874
01:02:05,249 --> 01:02:07,922
You don't love me
because who my father is.

875
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:22,927
Try to understand.
l have to watch the river bed.

876
01:02:23,649 --> 01:02:27,767
That other fellow could watch.
Get in river bed with him.

877
01:02:30,689 --> 01:02:33,123
lf your neck wasn't so lovely
l'd break it.

878
01:02:33,929 --> 01:02:35,442
You break the heart.

879
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,522
-Always l know you lie to me.
-No!

880
01:02:43,129 --> 01:02:46,121
But that lie is sweet

881
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:50,519
and my heart,
she sing like a bird.

882
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:56,119
l don't live without you, Ronnie.

883
01:02:57,129 --> 01:03:00,963
You crazy little loon.
What do you think you'll do?

884
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:04,407
-l'm going.
-No, you won't.

885
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:08,603
You're the sweetest poison
that ever got in a man's blood.

886
01:03:10,609 --> 01:03:11,598
l love you.

887
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,278
l want you.

888
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:21,839
We'll be in Batoche in one hour.

889
01:03:22,249 --> 01:03:23,318
Maybe less.

890
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:27,727
Ten minutes with the priest.

891
01:03:29,209 --> 01:03:30,801
An hour to get back here.

892
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:36,038
Ronnie!

893
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:39,277
l'll leave word for Jerry he'll have
to take15 minutes of my guard.

894
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:41,878
He'll yell, but he's a good egg.

895
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:36,838
Ronnie!

896
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,525
Ronnie, they're coming.

897
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:45,362
Wake up, Ronnie.

898
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:51,005
Get back to the fort!

899
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:57,329
The half-breeds ride.
Warn the force! Ambush...

900
01:05:13,049 --> 01:05:15,563
-What happened to this town?
-They all go Prince Albert

901
01:05:15,889 --> 01:05:17,208
to fight for Louis Riel.

902
01:05:17,729 --> 01:05:19,924
We wait in here
for Father Piccard.

903
01:05:23,729 --> 01:05:25,606
lt's dark as a weasel's bedroom.

904
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:40,724
Louvette!
The rifle!

905
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:47,048
Quick, Louvette!
The gun!

906
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:50,121
You don't need gun now, Ronnie.

907
01:05:57,409 --> 01:05:58,637
Tie him here.

908
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,767
You crawling black scum!

909
01:06:11,169 --> 01:06:13,080
-Shut up.
-Don't you hit him.

910
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:15,559
-Get out. Get out.
-Pay now.

911
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:23,719
Get out.

912
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:26,922
Get out.

913
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:35,197
Well, come on.

914
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:39,040
-Cut me loose.
-l got to keep you here.

915
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:42,560
lf l don't you be killed
like the others.

916
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:45,166
You sneaking shewolf.

917
01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:49,444
Killed? Like what others?

918
01:06:56,009 --> 01:07:01,481
ln Duck Lake woods 1,000 half
breed make trap for Redcoat.

919
01:07:07,049 --> 01:07:09,358
The whole force
will be cut to pieces.

920
01:07:10,169 --> 01:07:12,080
-Every man of them.
-Yeah.

921
01:07:14,249 --> 01:07:16,126
But you're alive is all l care.

922
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:24,126
You, dirty squaw.
Why didn't you tell me?

923
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,886
l'll kill you
when l get loose.

924
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:34,486
When you be safe
you kill me all you want.

925
01:08:19,369 --> 01:08:21,803
Back to the column. Warn them
the outpost's been killed.

926
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:23,999
Danger of enemy on all sides.
Gallop.

927
01:08:33,129 --> 01:08:34,847
You'd better get back
with the column.

928
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:37,038
Thanks.

929
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:27,206
That blue eyed klootch
has got him.

930
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:42,039
-That's destroying evidence.
-Which might put that boy

931
01:09:42,129 --> 01:09:43,767
in front of a firing squad.

932
01:09:45,129 --> 01:09:47,882
lf the whole column rides
into a death trap

933
01:09:48,169 --> 01:09:49,761
he'll deserve whatever he gets.

934
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:51,568
l was thinking of his sister.

935
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:55,127
Do you think it'll help to make
her pay for his mistakes?

936
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:02,601
Somebody's paying for it
right now.

937
01:10:13,089 --> 01:10:14,488
Sound commence firing.

938
01:10:32,129 --> 01:10:33,642
Take what cover you can find!

939
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:36,439
-Turn the wagons over for barricades!
-Yes, sir!

940
01:10:36,609 --> 01:10:38,804
Bring those wagons forward!
Steady men!

941
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:01,200
-Load!
-That gun!

942
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:03,799
She speak death like
the rattling snake.

943
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:06,642
Yes. She'll get me them
red coats for Big Bear.

944
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:14,646
Now that side!

945
01:11:37,009 --> 01:11:39,477
Sergeant Bret and that Texan
are coming through.

946
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:41,760
-Give them fire cover!
-Yes, sir.

947
01:11:46,609 --> 01:11:47,598
Clear there...

948
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:06,408
-Help the Sergeant.
-He's alright.

949
01:12:07,769 --> 01:12:09,646
You got nine lives, Sergeant.

950
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,278
Have a spill bud?

951
01:12:16,129 --> 01:12:17,926
No, thanks, just had one.

952
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,248
Keep your heads covered men.

953
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:31,240
Still got one good arm Bill, use it.

954
01:12:31,769 --> 01:12:33,680
Take your time!
Don't waste a shot!

955
01:12:40,169 --> 01:12:42,808
-Look at that hat. 20 bucks.
-Wear a feather.

956
01:12:51,569 --> 01:12:55,926
Get us out of this crossfire.
Fall back on Carlton.

957
01:12:56,329 --> 01:12:57,318
Yes, sir.

958
01:12:58,049 --> 01:13:00,199
Palmer, Rankin, root out
that snipers nest to the rear.

959
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:02,168
-Right that wagon for the wounded.
-Right.

960
01:13:02,289 --> 01:13:04,359
First section,
open the Carlton road.

961
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:11,605
Sections on the right,
fall back 50 yards.

962
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:13,680
Left sections hold fast.

963
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:16,680
Bugler, sound retire
and continue firing.

964
01:13:19,249 --> 01:13:20,921
Pick up all rifles.
Don't leave any ammunition.

965
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:49,161
Give me 10 men and l'll hold
the road while you drop back.

966
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:53,688
You drop back with the men.
l'll hold the road.

967
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,763
l can't hear you.

968
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:34,882
Louvette.

969
01:14:36,249 --> 01:14:37,921
Let me go to them.

970
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:41,639
l'll do anything.
l'll give you anything.

971
01:14:43,529 --> 01:14:47,522
No, Ronnie.
l don't let you be killed.

972
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:00,118
Doctor!

973
01:15:14,449 --> 01:15:18,328
-We're back at Fort Carlton.
-How many got back?

974
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:21,684
-We don't know yet, sir.
-Many?

975
01:15:22,489 --> 01:15:23,478
No, sir.

976
01:15:25,049 --> 01:15:28,405
They were in the woods thicker
than boiled beans on Tuesday.

977
01:15:29,129 --> 01:15:30,528
But we couldn't see them.

978
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:33,602
Jerry was on outpost.
Why didn't he warn us?

979
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:34,958
Jerry's dead.

980
01:15:35,049 --> 01:15:37,005
They must have got
Logan when they got Jerry.

981
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:39,480
Nobody got Logan.
He went over the hill.

982
01:15:39,689 --> 01:15:42,283
-l heard the Sergeant.
-Look out!

983
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:44,047
Ronnie didn't seem to be
that kind of a chap.

984
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:46,205
lf Ronnie had the slugs
in his legs l've got in mine

985
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:48,200
he couldn't have run so fast.

986
01:15:48,329 --> 01:15:50,968
Shut up, you fools!
That's his sister.

987
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:06,684
You always show up
where you can help.

988
01:16:07,009 --> 01:16:08,920
They let me leave Batoche
is morning.

989
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:12,366
-What are they saying about Ronnie?
-They're all out of their heads.

990
01:16:12,889 --> 01:16:14,402
Do any of you know where Ronnie is?

991
01:16:15,689 --> 01:16:19,364
-They don't know, April.
-Keep that stretcher working, Sheriff.

992
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,564
-Doctor, the inspector's real bad.
-Alright.

993
01:16:24,369 --> 01:16:25,768
Get this man ready.
l'll be back.

994
01:16:26,289 --> 01:16:28,803
-Some brandy here.
-Sergeant, bring that brandy.

995
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:32,806
-He's lost a lot of blood, no?
-Yes.

996
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:35,200
-Jim...
-l'm glad you're safe

997
01:16:35,369 --> 01:16:38,088
-but l wish you were anywhere else.
-l tried to get here in time.

998
01:16:38,649 --> 01:16:40,287
l could have saved all this...

999
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:42,800
l'd give that tourniquet
another twist.

1000
01:16:46,129 --> 01:16:47,323
Where's Ronnie?

1001
01:16:47,729 --> 01:16:49,959
-ls he... is he...?
-No.

1002
01:16:51,049 --> 01:16:53,722
l'm sorry. l have to go
to the lnspector now.

1003
01:16:54,529 --> 01:16:55,518
But...

1004
01:16:57,729 --> 01:16:59,924
Don't fight. You'll be alright.

1005
01:17:00,009 --> 01:17:02,079
l told you to take care
of the men.

1006
01:17:02,649 --> 01:17:05,527
-Yes, but...
-Nevermind me. Get to the others.

1007
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:10,878
Yes, sir.

1008
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:14,241
ls there an assault?

1009
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:17,559
-Not yet, sir.
-Man the bastions.

1010
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:19,157
l have, sir.

1011
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:23,003
Did you get proof
that Logan deserted?

1012
01:17:25,169 --> 01:17:26,158
Yes, sir.

1013
01:17:26,969 --> 01:17:30,848
When this is over,
make it your job to get him.

1014
01:17:31,969 --> 01:17:33,448
Bring him to justice.

1015
01:17:35,249 --> 01:17:36,238
Justice...

1016
01:17:37,209 --> 01:17:39,120
l'm about to get mind.

1017
01:17:41,049 --> 01:17:44,280
-Take command, Sergeant.
-Very good, sir.

1018
01:17:45,409 --> 01:17:48,924
Some fool at Headquarters,

1019
01:17:50,369 --> 01:17:53,088
wants to change
the uniform to green.

1020
01:17:55,089 --> 01:17:57,319
Stand up for the Redcoats.

1021
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:00,968
lt's a good color.

1022
01:18:14,449 --> 01:18:17,202
-Any sign of a rush?
-Just steady sniping.

1023
01:18:21,929 --> 01:18:23,328
-Tod...
-Keep your head down lad

1024
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:26,083
-if you don't want to lose it.
-Can you reach the river?

1025
01:18:27,889 --> 01:18:29,607
There's a very good chance.

1026
01:18:29,849 --> 01:18:33,398
Get the bateau and canoe
and moor them 100 yards below.

1027
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:35,247
We'll try to get through tonight.

1028
01:18:36,569 --> 01:18:37,638
That l will.

1029
01:18:38,209 --> 01:18:39,562
-Take his place.
-Right.

1030
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,801
Look! Look What l see!

1031
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,400
-Don't shoot.
-He is police scout.

1032
01:19:02,769 --> 01:19:04,441
He the Scotch man.

1033
01:19:05,169 --> 01:19:06,158
He's mine!

1034
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:09,637
Nobody shoot.

1035
01:19:26,209 --> 01:19:31,078
Where is the knob from the bonnet?
Darn!

1036
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:37,207
Blood of the devil!

1037
01:19:39,529 --> 01:19:42,487
Bonjour,
you snake in the bush?

1038
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:45,123
Duroc, you old porcupine.

1039
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:53,204
-Foosh to you.
-You son of a pumpkin?

1040
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:06,079
That's a pawky trick.

1041
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:10,802
You snooling clootie!

1042
01:20:12,249 --> 01:20:13,841
Who is snooling clootie?

1043
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:25,398
You bairn of a buzzard.

1044
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:29,802
My yarn, my bonnie yarn!
l'll never dare to show...

1045
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,198
Aye.

1046
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:44,881
You... You skunk you.

1047
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:51,761
Such a thing!

1048
01:20:52,689 --> 01:20:54,520
Darn these pants!

1049
01:20:57,249 --> 01:20:59,285
Hold 'em up with your teeth.

1050
01:21:03,569 --> 01:21:06,037
You, dirty Scotsman!

1051
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:17,565
Bonnie thing you look
going naked through the fen.

1052
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:20,201
For goodness sakes!

1053
01:21:25,529 --> 01:21:27,838
Yon goes the seat
of the government?

1054
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:30,242
Blood of a skunk.
l'll show you.

1055
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:40,318
Pig!

1056
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:48,003
Sharpshooter down there seems
to have McDuff cornered.

1057
01:21:48,249 --> 01:21:51,002
-Got a sight on him?
-No. He's behind...

1058
01:21:51,929 --> 01:21:52,918
Now l can.

1059
01:22:18,649 --> 01:22:20,162
Dan! Dan!

1060
01:22:23,489 --> 01:22:24,478
Dan...

1061
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:29,039
l didn't shoot you.

1062
01:22:31,769 --> 01:22:34,158
You win the 50 cents.

1063
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:37,566
No Dan. lt was from the fort.
You showed yourself.

1064
01:22:37,929 --> 01:22:39,999
You're an old fool my friend.

1065
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:45,009
One more game of pinnacle

1066
01:22:46,089 --> 01:22:48,319
l skin from you the belt.

1067
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:51,959
Aye, that you would Dan.

1068
01:22:52,249 --> 01:22:55,639
-That you would.
-No, Tod.

1069
01:22:58,769 --> 01:22:59,758
l lose.

1070
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:04,648
No, Dan, it is my loss,
every man's loss this day.

1071
01:23:05,809 --> 01:23:09,324
The Big Trapper
got me by the neck.

1072
01:23:11,969 --> 01:23:14,039
The 50 cents

1073
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:18,041
she's in my pocket.

1074
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:48,558
Soup?

1075
01:23:49,049 --> 01:23:52,007
-Any more soup and they'll bust?
-l must get this...

1076
01:23:52,129 --> 01:23:54,484
-Stop carrying it long enough...
-But...

1077
01:23:55,089 --> 01:23:59,082
You've been ramming around here
for 10 hours, using up all

1078
01:23:59,169 --> 01:24:02,366
the Queen's bandages
and l never saw you beat.

1079
01:24:02,729 --> 01:24:04,606
Well, you haven't
been playing croquet.

1080
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:08,444
Special orders is you stop now.
And have a cup of coffee.

1081
01:24:21,369 --> 01:24:23,007
Dusty, what happened?

1082
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:24,678
Happened?

1083
01:24:25,369 --> 01:24:26,882
Did something happen?

1084
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:30,006
l didn't notice anything happening.

1085
01:24:38,849 --> 01:24:40,487
l don't like women who cry.

1086
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:44,007
You know something, lady?

1087
01:24:45,129 --> 01:24:47,484
l make the best coffee in Texas.

1088
01:24:48,529 --> 01:24:50,599
You can float a horseshoe
in my coffee.

1089
01:24:51,329 --> 01:24:54,685
Over and over l hear them say his name
but they won't tell me anything.

1090
01:24:55,969 --> 01:24:58,767
Look... just kind of

1091
01:24:59,329 --> 01:25:03,004
-get down some of this Java
-Even Jim won't tell me anything.

1092
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:07,684
Two sugars?

1093
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:11,204
Jim is a great soldier.

1094
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:14,288
But if you don't drink
this here coffee...

1095
01:25:14,329 --> 01:25:17,082
Where is Ronnie?
What's happened to him?

1096
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:18,881
Now listen...

1097
01:25:20,209 --> 01:25:23,360
l don't know Ronnie so very well
but l know you.

1098
01:25:24,489 --> 01:25:28,243
The first time l saw you l knew
you better than anyone l've known.

1099
01:25:28,769 --> 01:25:32,603
l know it couldn't be in your
brother's blood to be cowardly.

1100
01:25:33,489 --> 01:25:34,478
But,

1101
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:38,566
love does funny things to people.

1102
01:25:52,129 --> 01:25:53,528
You've been a good soldier.

1103
01:25:56,809 --> 01:25:59,198
l've got a tough job for you,
if you'll take it.

1104
01:25:59,649 --> 01:26:01,924
You want me to put
some salt on Corbeau's tail?

1105
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:05,800
l'm trying to get the wounded
to the river under smoke cover.

1106
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:08,560
-What smoke?
-We'll burn the fort.

1107
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:10,968
-Coffee?
-Thanks.

1108
01:26:11,569 --> 01:26:13,719
lt'll be your job to get April
and the wounded down the river

1109
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:15,567
to meet Colonel lrvine's
reinforcements.

1110
01:26:16,009 --> 01:26:20,639
-You'll stay and roast chestnuts?
-l have 7 men sound enough to ride.

1111
01:26:22,089 --> 01:26:23,807
l'll be there when Corbeau

1112
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,159
throws those red coats
in front of Big Bear.

1113
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:29,568
Looks to me like you're just
delivering seven more red coats.

1114
01:26:30,089 --> 01:26:31,078
Maybe.

1115
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:35,478
Jim.

1116
01:26:37,249 --> 01:26:38,841
You've got to tell me.

1117
01:26:41,049 --> 01:26:42,038
l know it.

1118
01:26:43,769 --> 01:26:47,045
But let me tell you first
that l love you.

1119
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:53,085
Always l guess. You'll never
be able to look at me again.

1120
01:26:54,769 --> 01:26:56,839
Nothing under heaven
can ever bring us together...

1121
01:26:56,929 --> 01:26:58,521
What do you mean?

1122
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:04,967
You've got to know it,
so l'd rather you knew it from me.

1123
01:27:06,609 --> 01:27:07,928
Ronnie is not dead.

1124
01:27:08,409 --> 01:27:09,398
He deserted.

1125
01:27:09,889 --> 01:27:11,959
He left his post,
left his companion sentry.

1126
01:27:12,049 --> 01:27:13,118
He was killed.

1127
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:15,127
He could have warned the column.

1128
01:27:15,329 --> 01:27:18,162
All those men lying dead
might still be living if Ronnie...

1129
01:27:19,369 --> 01:27:21,041
-but he ran away.
-No, no!

1130
01:27:21,209 --> 01:27:23,769
He ran away with that half breed
Corbeau's daughter!

1131
01:27:23,849 --> 01:27:28,206
But l sent her to him,
to warn him, to warn you.

1132
01:27:28,369 --> 01:27:30,439
Didn't you know he'd sell
his soul for that girl?

1133
01:27:31,049 --> 01:27:32,562
l don't believe Ronnie deserted.

1134
01:27:32,849 --> 01:27:35,443
lf you prove it to me 100 times,
l still won't believe it.

1135
01:27:38,289 --> 01:27:39,278
Jim lad,

1136
01:27:39,929 --> 01:27:41,920
the half-breeds
being a wee bit confused

1137
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:45,803
with the death of poor Dan Duroc.
lt's the time to be going.

1138
01:27:46,129 --> 01:27:48,563
Tell Corporal Underhill to have
the patrol in full dress order

1139
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:51,880
sidearms and rifles
then set fire to the buildings.

1140
01:27:52,329 --> 01:27:54,285
Aye, all is ready then now.

1141
01:28:08,209 --> 01:28:10,359
l hope you never believe
Ronnie is guilty

1142
01:28:12,049 --> 01:28:13,801
but that doesn't change my job.

1143
01:28:15,649 --> 01:28:18,686
When this over l'm going
to get him and bring him back.

1144
01:28:20,289 --> 01:28:23,759
l will get him if l have
to follow him over the icecap.

1145
01:28:24,969 --> 01:28:27,039
You know what that means for him.

1146
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:30,484
l know you're duty comes
before everything else.

1147
01:28:30,729 --> 01:28:32,924
l know it means
more than mercy or love.

1148
01:28:33,289 --> 01:28:34,961
Go on, follow your orders.

1149
01:28:35,249 --> 01:28:38,207
Kill that boy who was foolish
enough to put love first!

1150
01:28:38,889 --> 01:28:40,959
But don't tell me
how sorry you are!

1151
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:44,159
Just do your duty and kill!

1152
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:51,003
We'll take you and the wounded
as far as the river.

1153
01:28:52,609 --> 01:28:54,759
Dusty will take care of you there.

1154
01:28:56,209 --> 01:28:58,200
We're going on to Big Bear's camp.

1155
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:01,881
Pray that l don't come back.

1156
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:28,399
You'll have to let me
look after you now.

1157
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:31,923
-Better throw some wash in my face.
-What?

1158
01:29:32,929 --> 01:29:34,760
l have no right to be crying
over my troubles.

1159
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:38,206
The wounded must be moved.
They'll need all the help we can give.

1160
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,639
Looks like you need
some help yourself lady.

1161
01:29:46,289 --> 01:29:47,802
Attent hut!

1162
01:29:52,329 --> 01:29:53,921
This is a volunteer patrol.

1163
01:29:54,809 --> 01:29:56,481
Once we've entered Big Bear's camp

1164
01:29:56,649 --> 01:29:59,288
no man of you can properly
expect to come out alive.

1165
01:30:02,169 --> 01:30:06,845
lf any of you prefer to go
with the wounded you may fall out.

1166
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:11,998
Thank you.

1167
01:30:15,089 --> 01:30:16,158
Fyffe, you're hurt.

1168
01:30:16,809 --> 01:30:18,367
You'll have to go with the wounded.

1169
01:30:18,489 --> 01:30:20,923
No, l'm alright.
l can fight.

1170
01:30:21,089 --> 01:30:23,808
Join the wounded as directed.

1171
01:30:24,409 --> 01:30:25,398
Yes, sir.

1172
01:30:30,249 --> 01:30:32,399
We'll take the wounded
to the river first.

1173
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:34,082
Keep them under cover.

1174
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:37,638
Corporal, mount the patrol.

1175
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:40,684
Patrol! Prepare to mount.

1176
01:30:45,009 --> 01:30:46,840
They die in there you think.

1177
01:30:47,329 --> 01:30:50,401
Maybe so.
l don't see nobody come out.

1178
01:31:00,649 --> 01:31:02,640
Men with leg wounds
man the paddles.

1179
01:31:04,249 --> 01:31:07,161
Dusty and McDuff,
scout the shores with a canoe.

1180
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:16,965
lt's a dangerous place
you choose lassie.

1181
01:31:17,049 --> 01:31:19,040
l can't leave these two men.
They're the worst hurt.

1182
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:28,328
Good luck, Soldier.

1183
01:31:30,369 --> 01:31:31,358
Thanks.

1184
01:32:20,849 --> 01:32:23,841
That'll be Colonel lrvine's
relief column.

1185
01:32:24,089 --> 01:32:25,317
ln camp, beyond the bend.

1186
01:32:26,089 --> 01:32:27,807
That's a pretty sounding noise.

1187
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,639
l was afraid these boys
would never see that camp.

1188
01:32:31,649 --> 01:32:35,085
You're going to and you'll
get some rest. l'm leaving.

1189
01:32:35,969 --> 01:32:38,437
-Why?
-Going hunting.

1190
01:32:39,009 --> 01:32:41,728
lt's no use.
Jim has Corbeau by now.

1191
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:46,162
-Or Corbeau has...
-l wasn't thinking about Corbeau.

1192
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:49,518
Ronnie?

1193
01:32:51,249 --> 01:32:55,765
Well, l'd like to have a powow
with the wolfgirl he's been with.

1194
01:32:57,049 --> 01:32:59,040
Ronnie's dead. l know he is.

1195
01:32:59,489 --> 01:33:04,165
He wouldn't run away.
He'd come back and face it.

1196
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:10,078
Sure he would.
Maybe he can't come back.

1197
01:33:11,249 --> 01:33:12,887
Maybe he sort of lost his head.

1198
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:18,408
l got a feeling l can make
things easier for you

1199
01:33:19,009 --> 01:33:19,998
if you'd let me.

1200
01:33:22,089 --> 01:33:26,799
You're grand person, but there's
nothing anyone can do for me.

1201
01:33:28,129 --> 01:33:31,007
Sure there is.
Come to Texas with me.

1202
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:34,959
lf Ronnie's alive,
he'll find us there.

1203
01:33:36,329 --> 01:33:40,880
l'll never see Ronnie again.
He's gone.

1204
01:33:42,089 --> 01:33:44,478
Not when somebody cares as much
about you as l do.

1205
01:33:46,689 --> 01:33:49,362
lf you want what's left of me
after all this

1206
01:33:50,009 --> 01:33:51,158
l'll go with you.

1207
01:33:53,369 --> 01:33:57,078
l'm a coward Dusty!
l want to run away.

1208
01:34:00,249 --> 01:34:02,888
You're the loveliest and
gentlest woman l've ever known

1209
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:07,204
but you haven't closed
your eyes in 24 hours.

1210
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:11,209
l don't want you to say yes
without thinking.

1211
01:34:11,409 --> 01:34:13,240
l don't want to think.

1212
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:18,166
When we get to Texas,
you won't have to.

1213
01:34:20,769 --> 01:34:24,682
-Texas must be heaven.
-lt will be when you get there.

1214
01:34:32,649 --> 01:34:36,801
Pull into shore Tod, then take
April down to lrvine's camp.

1215
01:34:37,129 --> 01:34:38,721
l'm splitting off here.

1216
01:34:39,049 --> 01:34:41,199
What manner of frisky
are you up to now?.

1217
01:34:42,769 --> 01:34:45,841
Well, there's a couple
of things l got to do.

1218
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:59,482
l kept my promise Big Bear.
Red coats full of holes like a net.

1219
01:35:01,049 --> 01:35:04,962
This one belonged to that Sergeant
who said he'd put me in irons.

1220
01:35:08,889 --> 01:35:11,005
Medicine gun speak like thunder.

1221
01:35:11,649 --> 01:35:14,322
Keep your promise, Big Bear.
War!

1222
01:35:21,769 --> 01:35:23,805
Kill. War!

1223
01:35:24,289 --> 01:35:25,278
War!

1224
01:36:08,649 --> 01:36:10,401
So dead men ride?

1225
01:36:39,369 --> 01:36:41,280
You cannot kill the dead.

1226
01:36:54,449 --> 01:36:57,759
Tell your war chief to spread
his blanket on the ground Big Bear?

1227
01:36:58,169 --> 01:37:00,444
Tell your men to fire!
Kill the dogs!

1228
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:05,520
You tell me they are dead.

1229
01:37:05,929 --> 01:37:08,523
Let us know what dead men want.

1230
01:37:09,649 --> 01:37:13,437
Nestestu! Put the blanket here.

1231
01:37:14,089 --> 01:37:15,078
The blanket!

1232
01:37:18,769 --> 01:37:20,361
Put the blanket here.

1233
01:37:22,649 --> 01:37:25,766
The spirits of the brave
are still inside their red coats.

1234
01:37:26,569 --> 01:37:30,482
They are sacred. Tell your men
to lay them on the blanket.

1235
01:37:34,889 --> 01:37:38,040
The brothers of the dead
are brave.

1236
01:37:39,569 --> 01:37:42,402
Put them on the blanket.

1237
01:37:44,889 --> 01:37:49,326
No, no! These enemies are
in your hands. Pull them down!

1238
01:37:49,449 --> 01:37:52,202
Kill them! Now!

1239
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:06,641
lf one shot is fired,
the soldiers of the Queen

1240
01:38:06,769 --> 01:38:09,044
will come like the sands
of the great salt sea.

1241
01:38:09,809 --> 01:38:11,845
You and your sons will die

1242
01:38:12,289 --> 01:38:15,599
and your children's children
will never walk on the Earth.

1243
01:38:19,729 --> 01:38:23,199
The other coats Big Bear.
We are waiting.

1244
01:38:26,329 --> 01:38:28,240
Put the coats on the blanket.

1245
01:38:36,249 --> 01:38:38,046
Pull 'em off the horses!
Kill them!

1246
01:38:43,409 --> 01:38:47,084
Are you afraid of 7 men?
Kill them, you fools!

1247
01:38:53,449 --> 01:38:55,838
There's no magic in their red coats.

1248
01:38:59,889 --> 01:39:01,561
Throw them to the crows.

1249
01:39:01,889 --> 01:39:02,878
Like this.

1250
01:39:04,089 --> 01:39:05,408
You're under arrest!

1251
01:39:06,769 --> 01:39:08,680
Shoot, you fools! Shoot!

1252
01:39:09,489 --> 01:39:10,478
Shut up!

1253
01:39:11,129 --> 01:39:13,006
Two men on the left, dismount.

1254
01:39:17,089 --> 01:39:18,408
Take the prisoner.

1255
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:21,208
-On your feet, now.
-What's the matter? Tired?

1256
01:39:21,809 --> 01:39:23,879
You're too heavy to carry.

1257
01:39:30,849 --> 01:39:32,567
Will Big Bear kneel to the Queen

1258
01:39:32,809 --> 01:39:35,198
and be the chief
of his people again?

1259
01:39:36,809 --> 01:39:39,960
The Cree
are brothers to the brave.

1260
01:39:54,169 --> 01:39:56,922
This fellow keep Redcoats
out of Batoche.

1261
01:40:19,009 --> 01:40:19,998
Look!

1262
01:40:24,089 --> 01:40:26,125
The canoes go down river
by himself!

1263
01:40:26,449 --> 01:40:28,121
lt's my bateau, come on!

1264
01:41:08,049 --> 01:41:09,448
Look! Come on!

1265
01:41:09,649 --> 01:41:11,765
-Let's go!
-Don't let him go.

1266
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:21,808
You know Louvette?

1267
01:41:22,889 --> 01:41:26,120
No Gatling gun, no Riel,
no lndians, no fight.

1268
01:41:26,329 --> 01:41:28,968
You come home,
l give you all the fight you want.

1269
01:41:29,449 --> 01:41:30,677
Yes, mama.

1270
01:41:36,129 --> 01:41:38,768
-You know Louvette Corbeau?
-l know no one like that.

1271
01:41:39,209 --> 01:41:40,801
Well, l guess that's right.

1272
01:41:44,529 --> 01:41:46,759
-You want something?
-You know Louvette?

1273
01:41:46,889 --> 01:41:48,527
-Yes.
-Of course.

1274
01:41:49,409 --> 01:41:53,084
-Louvette Corbeau?
-Sure. Come on.

1275
01:42:11,049 --> 01:42:12,277
Are you hungry?

1276
01:42:14,849 --> 01:42:15,838
No.

1277
01:42:19,809 --> 01:42:21,720
You don't feel good, huh?

1278
01:42:23,889 --> 01:42:25,117
l feel alright.

1279
01:42:27,009 --> 01:42:29,125
A man's brain can be sick.

1280
01:42:30,369 --> 01:42:34,362
He goes on breathing
and living until he rots.

1281
01:42:35,409 --> 01:42:39,925
My heart wants you so much.
She all the time say your name.

1282
01:42:40,649 --> 01:42:42,446
Ronnie, Ronnie...

1283
01:42:42,649 --> 01:42:45,766
l should have torn your tongue out
the first time l heard you say that.

1284
01:42:48,249 --> 01:42:50,160
No, we go away Ronnie.

1285
01:42:51,129 --> 01:42:52,881
Way up to far North.

1286
01:42:53,769 --> 01:42:55,361
To land of little sticks.

1287
01:42:56,329 --> 01:42:58,445
Nobody don't find us there.

1288
01:43:00,889 --> 01:43:02,959
One man l can't get away
from even there.

1289
01:43:06,009 --> 01:43:09,479
A filthy rat that can't
stand the sight of his own face.

1290
01:43:11,369 --> 01:43:12,358
Me.

1291
01:43:12,489 --> 01:43:15,003
My love, l make you forget.

1292
01:43:15,329 --> 01:43:16,318
Forget?

1293
01:43:16,969 --> 01:43:18,880
l ought to...!

1294
01:43:19,849 --> 01:43:21,362
You want to kill me?

1295
01:43:24,249 --> 01:43:26,205
l'm too much of a coward
even to do that.

1296
01:43:32,529 --> 01:43:33,928
Because l love you.

1297
01:43:36,769 --> 01:43:38,441
Two wild geese go north.

1298
01:43:46,249 --> 01:43:47,318
Hello, Ronnie.

1299
01:43:53,409 --> 01:43:54,808
Why you come here?

1300
01:43:55,089 --> 01:43:57,205
l was just passing by.

1301
01:44:06,409 --> 01:44:09,481
lt looks like this war
is kind of bogged down.

1302
01:44:10,449 --> 01:44:12,599
You come here for hurt him?

1303
01:44:13,649 --> 01:44:17,562
Nothing l say could hurt him any.
lt's already been said.

1304
01:44:19,489 --> 01:44:21,844
-What's been said?
-Don't listen to him, Ronnie.

1305
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:24,048
l want to know!

1306
01:44:26,249 --> 01:44:27,238
Well,

1307
01:44:29,009 --> 01:44:32,524
that you ran from your post
and you're hiding out like a skunk

1308
01:44:32,729 --> 01:44:35,846
and haven't got what it takes
to go back and swallow your medicine.

1309
01:44:36,569 --> 01:44:38,560
-Does April say that?
-No.

1310
01:44:39,329 --> 01:44:41,001
She figures you're dead.

1311
01:44:41,369 --> 01:44:44,281
She knows if you could even crawl
you'd get back there to face 'em.

1312
01:44:44,409 --> 01:44:45,728
Don't listen to him!

1313
01:44:46,329 --> 01:44:48,240
lf you go back they kill you.

1314
01:44:50,449 --> 01:44:54,078
She may be right.
The militia's brought in martial law.

1315
01:44:56,449 --> 01:45:00,522
You know the Mounted Police
are a great body of men.

1316
01:45:01,409 --> 01:45:05,925
For years they've been through hell
without a yellow mark against them.

1317
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:09,646
l'd hate to see April's brother
be the first to chalk one up.

1318
01:45:10,129 --> 01:45:13,485
Make him go away.
He just talk crazy lie for you.

1319
01:45:15,289 --> 01:45:20,317
-l'm heading for Batoche, coming?
-No, Ronnie, no!

1320
01:45:26,849 --> 01:45:27,838
You coming?

1321
01:45:28,729 --> 01:45:29,718
What for?

1322
01:45:31,609 --> 01:45:35,079
l'm already buried in the grave
of every man killed at Duck Lake.

1323
01:45:38,049 --> 01:45:41,166
-They're bound to find you.
-With your help?

1324
01:45:42,409 --> 01:45:44,718
No, they don't never find.

1325
01:45:47,089 --> 01:45:50,001
l fix so you don't tell nothing.

1326
01:45:59,889 --> 01:46:05,327
l won't turn you in,
but April's got a right to know.

1327
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,086
Why don't you let me stay dead?

1328
01:46:12,729 --> 01:46:14,720
Because you're not a coward.

1329
01:46:24,569 --> 01:46:27,402
Whiteman, ride horse
with white face.

1330
01:46:40,089 --> 01:46:41,238
Go quick, Crow.

1331
01:46:44,249 --> 01:46:45,762
Go get him.

1332
01:46:51,689 --> 01:46:56,285
Viva Canadian womens,
fly my heart, fly high!

1333
01:46:56,409 --> 01:46:59,845
Viva Canadian womens,
who has so sweet the eyes!

1334
01:47:00,049 --> 01:47:04,361
Who has so sweet the eye!
Who has so sweet the eye!

1335
01:47:12,209 --> 01:47:13,198
Ronnie?

1336
01:47:15,889 --> 01:47:18,278
He's gone to Batoche.
l loaned him my horse.

1337
01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:25,678
Ronnie!

1338
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:42,358
Ronnie!

1339
01:47:49,769 --> 01:47:50,758
Ronnie!

1340
01:48:01,089 --> 01:48:02,078
Ronnie...

1341
01:48:27,769 --> 01:48:28,758
Kill...

1342
01:48:32,529 --> 01:48:34,121
Kill...

1343
01:48:38,969 --> 01:48:41,244
Kill...

1344
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:46,447
How much l morn for you...

1345
01:49:22,729 --> 01:49:25,163
Love does funny things
to people.

1346
01:49:44,689 --> 01:49:46,680
Captain Gower
of the Canadian Militia

1347
01:49:46,889 --> 01:49:48,288
is here to help us get what facts

1348
01:49:48,329 --> 01:49:50,445
we can concerning the ambush
at Duck Lake

1349
01:49:50,889 --> 01:49:52,959
before the General
convenes his court martial.

1350
01:49:53,089 --> 01:49:54,078
Yes, sir.

1351
01:49:54,249 --> 01:49:56,479
l'm the one to blame.
Not my brother.

1352
01:49:56,809 --> 01:49:59,277
l sent her to him,
sent her to warn him.

1353
01:49:59,449 --> 01:50:02,202
Miss Logan,
none of us are on trial.

1354
01:50:02,529 --> 01:50:04,406
We're only trying
to find out what happened.

1355
01:50:05,209 --> 01:50:07,165
l should have known Louvette
would lie to him.

1356
01:50:07,449 --> 01:50:09,041
-That she...
-That she was in love with him

1357
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:12,486
and would persuade him
to run away with her.

1358
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:14,600
That's not true!
Ronnie wasn't afraid of anything.

1359
01:50:15,529 --> 01:50:17,326
lf he's alive, he'll come back.

1360
01:50:17,689 --> 01:50:22,763
l'm very sorry but the evidence
we've gathered is conclusive.

1361
01:50:24,769 --> 01:50:28,284
Sergeant, you are personal
assignment is to keep after Logan

1362
01:50:28,769 --> 01:50:31,647
until you've place him under arrest.

1363
01:50:33,449 --> 01:50:34,438
Yes, sir.

1364
01:50:34,529 --> 01:50:36,997
-That is all!
-Capitan Gower...

1365
01:50:37,409 --> 01:50:41,482
-What is it?
-l don't know. Someone got killed.

1366
01:50:42,529 --> 01:50:44,281
Fall back!
Fall back there!

1367
01:50:45,569 --> 01:50:47,446
Constable Logan reporting.

1368
01:50:51,929 --> 01:50:52,918
Ronnie!

1369
01:50:59,449 --> 01:51:02,043
-Who is this man?
-An American Peace Officer,

1370
01:51:02,209 --> 01:51:03,722
Texas Rangers.

1371
01:51:03,769 --> 01:51:05,088
ls this Constable Logan's body?

1372
01:51:05,209 --> 01:51:07,643
-Yes, sir.
-l don't understand.

1373
01:51:08,089 --> 01:51:11,638
This boy was captured. Look
at his wrists where the thongs cut in.

1374
01:51:13,569 --> 01:51:15,321
They thought you ran away...

1375
01:51:22,289 --> 01:51:24,325
The man has been bound certainly.

1376
01:51:24,729 --> 01:51:27,766
l don't know how he got loose
but when l saw him he was free.

1377
01:51:28,129 --> 01:51:30,404
Maybe he could have got back
to report but he didn't.

1378
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:33,198
Because there was something
he wanted

1379
01:51:33,969 --> 01:51:35,800
more than he wanted
his own life.

1380
01:51:38,209 --> 01:51:41,724
-What do you mean?
-l mean the Gatling gun.

1381
01:51:42,489 --> 01:51:44,639
What did Logan have to do
with the Gatling gun?

1382
01:51:45,209 --> 01:51:48,042
The half-breeds had it on the bluff,
commanding the south approach.

1383
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:51,679
We saw what happens to troops
who rush a gun like that.

1384
01:51:51,929 --> 01:51:54,762
But the kid could rush it because
he was on the inside of their lines.

1385
01:51:55,249 --> 01:51:57,809
Now you all decided
he quit his post.

1386
01:51:58,529 --> 01:52:00,838
Where l come from
we don't jump to conclusions.

1387
01:52:00,969 --> 01:52:03,358
lt's liable to be
a fellow's last jump.

1388
01:52:04,569 --> 01:52:06,321
l can tell you every move
the boy made.

1389
01:52:06,649 --> 01:52:09,527
And l can tell you this,
if you'd had 3 more men like him

1390
01:52:09,609 --> 01:52:11,884
you'd have put down
your rebellion in 24 hours.

1391
01:52:12,329 --> 01:52:16,288
He got their boats in the river
to pull the crew

1392
01:52:16,409 --> 01:52:18,525
away from the gun,
then he got a horse

1393
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:21,721
and dragged the gun off
riding like a bat out of hell.

1394
01:52:22,209 --> 01:52:24,962
The half-breeds spotted him
but he got the bluff above the river.

1395
01:52:26,329 --> 01:52:28,365
Bullets were as thick as flies

1396
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:32,038
but they didn't stop him
over he goes, horse, man, and gun

1397
01:52:32,129 --> 01:52:34,643
rolling like a Texas
twister over the sheer drop.

1398
01:52:35,409 --> 01:52:36,728
That's where l find him.

1399
01:52:37,369 --> 01:52:40,202
That's where you'll find the gun
at the bottom of the river.

1400
01:52:42,129 --> 01:52:44,643
He never gave up.
He never quit.

1401
01:52:44,769 --> 01:52:47,886
He never ran away from anything
because it wasn't in him to run.

1402
01:52:49,209 --> 01:52:52,679
He just kept going on like
l think you'd want him to.

1403
01:52:53,329 --> 01:52:56,685
Constable Logan shall receive
the highest military honors.

1404
01:52:57,369 --> 01:53:00,520
l'll mention Logan's bravery
to General Middleton.

1405
01:53:01,889 --> 01:53:03,925
Where were you all this time?

1406
01:53:06,329 --> 01:53:09,321
l was squeezed under a log
so tight l was

1407
01:53:09,729 --> 01:53:12,038
breathing on the installment plan.

1408
01:53:13,209 --> 01:53:16,360
Shall l include that in my letter
to your Texas Commandant?

1409
01:53:19,209 --> 01:53:23,361
l hope you won't. l'll be
in trouble enough without Corbeau.

1410
01:53:27,409 --> 01:53:28,398
Dusty!

1411
01:53:30,329 --> 01:53:31,921
You're an angel in leather.

1412
01:53:33,929 --> 01:53:36,397
l'd look funny with leather wings.

1413
01:53:45,649 --> 01:53:48,243
l'm sorry l misjudged a brave man.

1414
01:53:49,609 --> 01:53:50,598
Yes, we...

1415
01:53:51,849 --> 01:53:52,838
all are.

1416
01:53:55,969 --> 01:53:56,958
Sergeant!

1417
01:53:57,289 --> 01:54:00,122
You will deliver prisoners
Riel and Corbeau to Regina.

1418
01:54:01,889 --> 01:54:04,278
-Last stop before Regina.
-Long way to ride

1419
01:54:04,449 --> 01:54:06,963
-before a hanging.
-They don't think so.

1420
01:54:13,329 --> 01:54:16,082
You be tying a wet knot.

1421
01:54:19,929 --> 01:54:23,763
Eight days with them
traveling 200 miles.

1422
01:54:24,049 --> 01:54:26,324
Cold molasses could move faster.

1423
01:54:29,209 --> 01:54:30,403
Thank you.

1424
01:54:30,529 --> 01:54:35,444
-Where's Jim?
-Went riding with April.

1425
01:54:38,569 --> 01:54:42,323
lf l should disappear,
you know, vanish

1426
01:54:42,649 --> 01:54:46,278
will you tell April
l'll be back for her?

1427
01:54:46,849 --> 01:54:49,727
lf you're as blind on the trail
as you are with your lassie

1428
01:54:50,009 --> 01:54:52,967
you'll never find your way back.

1429
01:54:53,809 --> 01:54:56,607
l could never manage
one of these contraptions.

1430
01:54:58,569 --> 01:55:00,161
lt's a shame to waste it.

1431
01:55:13,889 --> 01:55:16,528
Either the hand of fate or

1432
01:55:17,009 --> 01:55:19,364
someone thinks
you ought to shave?

1433
01:55:24,449 --> 01:55:25,438
Well?

1434
01:55:26,729 --> 01:55:31,166
No, one maybe can get through,
but there's no chance for two.

1435
01:55:31,849 --> 01:55:33,680
Find your own finish.

1436
01:55:34,049 --> 01:55:36,438
l'm ready for mine
whatever it may be.

1437
01:55:54,329 --> 01:55:56,206
l'll have my knife back now.

1438
01:55:58,849 --> 01:56:00,077
l give it to you!

1439
01:56:01,209 --> 01:56:02,801
No, sunny side up.

1440
01:56:06,929 --> 01:56:09,318
Now we're heading back for Texas.

1441
01:56:09,849 --> 01:56:13,922
l hid your horse under that
silver mine you call a saddle.

1442
01:56:32,569 --> 01:56:33,888
Just a minute, cowboy!

1443
01:56:51,369 --> 01:56:52,358
Going somewhere?

1444
01:56:54,729 --> 01:56:57,084
Don't look like
l'm going very far.

1445
01:56:57,569 --> 01:57:01,562
Come on out, April. lt's nobody
but Dusty taking a little ride.

1446
01:57:03,369 --> 01:57:05,519
Just trying to get away from it all.

1447
01:57:11,969 --> 01:57:13,880
Can we ride a little way
with you, Dusty?

1448
01:57:17,769 --> 01:57:19,680
Why yes, ma'am.

1449
01:57:29,409 --> 01:57:33,402
Do Canadians ever go
snow blind in the summer?

1450
01:57:35,809 --> 01:57:38,607
We're all a little blind sometimes.

1451
01:57:38,809 --> 01:57:39,798
l'm not.

1452
01:57:40,009 --> 01:57:43,399
There's talk some fellow may try
to get Corbeau away from us.

1453
01:57:44,449 --> 01:57:47,407
-How's that again?
-lt's only 100 miles

1454
01:57:47,569 --> 01:57:50,083
from the Montana border.
And no telegraph.

1455
01:57:51,809 --> 01:57:52,798
ls that so?

1456
01:57:53,249 --> 01:57:55,843
l'll check when l get back.
lf anyone's missing

1457
01:57:56,049 --> 01:57:58,005
l'll have every man in the troop
after them.

1458
01:57:59,529 --> 01:58:01,804
l can't say l blame you.

1459
01:58:02,209 --> 01:58:04,598
Jim, Dusty seems a little restless.

1460
01:58:05,569 --> 01:58:08,447
Maybe he's thinking about a man
who moved in on a friend

1461
01:58:08,649 --> 01:58:09,718
that trusted him.

1462
01:58:09,889 --> 01:58:12,084
Sneaked in behind his back like
a weasel in a hen coop

1463
01:58:12,209 --> 01:58:14,882
and stole the one thing
his friend valued most.

1464
01:58:16,489 --> 01:58:18,207
No, l wasn't thinking
about that.

1465
01:58:18,529 --> 01:58:20,008
Wouldn't you say
he'd loathe his friend

1466
01:58:20,089 --> 01:58:22,478
for doing such a low
contemptible thing to him?

1467
01:58:23,009 --> 01:58:25,000
He'd certainly owe him
an apology.

1468
01:58:25,329 --> 01:58:27,479
Well? l apologize.

1469
01:58:29,889 --> 01:58:31,208
You apologize?

1470
01:58:32,609 --> 01:58:34,122
Jim's trying to tell you that

1471
01:58:34,449 --> 01:58:37,043
he's taking something
he thought belonged to you.

1472
01:58:39,569 --> 01:58:40,558
You?

1473
01:58:40,929 --> 01:58:42,203
lf l'm free.

1474
01:58:43,209 --> 01:58:46,201
She told me once, l'd be alright
if something beat me to my knees.

1475
01:58:47,169 --> 01:58:48,602
l've been brought down hard.

1476
01:58:49,369 --> 01:58:53,408
No, l'm the one who surrendered.
But l wouldn't change him.

1477
01:58:55,689 --> 01:58:58,078
l guess l've just been having
a beautiful pipe dream

1478
01:58:58,209 --> 01:58:59,961
in the middle of a nightmare.

1479
01:59:00,769 --> 01:59:01,758
Sure.

1480
01:59:02,449 --> 01:59:03,962
Sure, you're free.

1481
01:59:04,969 --> 01:59:08,644
You got what we both want,
l got what l came for.

1482
01:59:09,889 --> 01:59:11,208
l'll say the Mounted Police

1483
01:59:11,289 --> 01:59:13,359
are the greatest outfit
l ever tangled with

1484
01:59:14,889 --> 01:59:16,083
and the luckiest.

1485
01:59:16,409 --> 01:59:19,082
Texas Rangers are two fisted
fighters themselves.

1486
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:22,561
And one of them is the most
magnificent liar in the world.

1487
01:59:27,609 --> 01:59:28,678
Goodbye, Dusty.

1488
01:59:32,089 --> 01:59:33,841
Texas is gonna miss you.

1489
01:59:34,529 --> 01:59:37,362
There'll always be a part
of Texas in our hearts.

1490
01:59:40,769 --> 01:59:42,361
Come on, sweetheart.

1491
02:00:02,369 --> 02:00:03,961
Come on, sweetheart.
