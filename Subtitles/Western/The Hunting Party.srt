1
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:00,400
Brandt!

2
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,036
Stop!

3
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,837
Brandt?

4
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:37,436
Get dressed.

5
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:42,774
- Brandt, why do we have...
- Get dressed!

6
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:16,978
Frank Calder!

7
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:21,114
Sheriff Ben C. Johnson,
Ruger County!

8
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,787
We hung four
of your kind last spring!

9
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:30,926
Don't come into town,
and don't stop no place in the county!

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,195
Nowhere in Ruger County!

11
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:23,215
Matt!

12
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,512
Brandt. Whoa!

13
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,750
You son of a gun!

14
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:30,485
- You made it!
- Yeah!

15
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,357
Why, I rode all night.

16
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,919
- Good to see you!
- I couldn't get away any sooner!

17
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,329
- Sam! Buford!
- You son of a gun!

18
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,560
I knew you'd make it!

19
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:40,966
I decided to do it the hard way.
Straight through.

20
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,902
I wouldn't miss this for anything!

21
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,330
- Let's get started!
- Melissa!

22
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,808
I knew it'd take
a hunting trip to get you here.

23
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:50,641
Come on, boys.
Move 'em on. Move 'em on.

24
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,203
Move 'em on.

25
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:55,415
Put that
in the forward sleeper.

26
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:58,078
Melissa, let the men say goodbye!
We're ready to go!

27
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,485
Thank you for a wonderful stay,
Mrs. Ruger.

28
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,218
- Always welcome.
- And the hospitality.

29
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:04,623
Nobody keeps a better house.

30
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:07,492
Emma and I would like you and Brandt
to join us in Paris in the fall.

31
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:08,825
I'd love to. Talk to Brandt.

32
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:11,389
Get Mr. Gunn's rig
on up the stable.

33
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,363
All right, Matt.
Let's get on board.

34
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,601
Brandt, if Melissa's
gonna be too lonesome,

35
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,835
I'd be happy to stay behind.

36
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,901
Yeah, I bet you would.

37
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,005
Can't pry her away from you
no matter what I do.

38
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,681
Back in two weeks?

39
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:34,689
- Yeah.
- Brandt, can't we talk...

40
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:37,954
Tell Jed when he gets back to keep
that bull away from them longhorns.

41
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,930
Tell Jed to keep his eye
on that grass in the new section.

42
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,891
Go on in, Edward.
Jimmy, you let him by!

43
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:21,794
Morning!

44
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:23,202
Morning, Mary!

45
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,331
Go on in, Edward.
They won't bother you.

46
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,569
Good thing you like children.
I don't know how...

47
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:30,134
Boys, stop!
Edward, Jimmy, get in!

48
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:33,045
I don't know how I'd manage
if you didn't help me, Melissa.

49
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,642
Glad to do it!
Girls, come on! Get in to school.

50
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,858
A-B-C-D-E-F-G

51
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,455
H-l-J-K-L-M-N-O-P

52
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:06,558
Q-R-S and T-U-V

53
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:09,570
W and X-Y-Z

54
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:12,232
Now you've heard my A-B-C's

55
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:15,937
Tell me what you think of me

56
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,427
No!

57
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,948
Come on!

58
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,934
Now, wait a minute!
Don't be that way, honey!

59
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:16,494
There!

60
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:19,905
Now, don't fall out!
We just gettin' started!

61
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,641
There, you sweet little thing!

62
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,715
I ain't gonna hurt you!

63
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,776
But I sure would like to try!

64
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:36,380
You're a cute little thing, ain't you?
You need breathing room in there!

65
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:41,361
Hog! Now, you save me seconds
on that, goddamn you!

66
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,192
No!

67
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:47,702
You ain't goin' nowhere,
are you, now, honey?

68
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,904
All right with me!
I love ya. Can't you see that?

69
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:58,811
Now, if you just help by gettin'
your ass down on that flour sack!

70
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:01,543
Hog, lemme see!
Lemme see!

71
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,079
Goddamn stuff!
I love you, baby!

72
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,021
And I'm gonna get me some of that!

73
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,083
Get in there, Hog!
Get in there!

74
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:34,449
You rotten bastard!

75
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,575
Just 'cause you got me
and Jim Loring outta that...

76
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:50,925
You son of a bitch!

77
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,636
Come on! Let's go!

78
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:51,817
We're gonna go up
across cattle country.

79
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:53,953
We'll be on the trail
about six weeks.

80
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:56,190
Don't you touch me!

81
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,998
Ain't nobody
gonna hurt you, little lady.

82
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,502
You just get outta that wagon.

83
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,834
I'm not gonna go any further!
You can't!

84
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,497
- There, you...
- You shut up!

85
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:10,074
Now, you just get
outta that wagon!

86
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,371
You get ahold of things.

87
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,144
I promise you...

88
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,856
Ain't anybody gonna hurt you.

89
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:27,955
Just as long
as you do as you're told.

90
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:44,475
Fella I knew
give it to me once.

91
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:48,743
You're gonna teach me to read.

92
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,781
That's what you're here for.

93
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:02,487
I'm just a country boy.
I'll stick to eggs.

94
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,395
Where'd you get quail
this time of year?

95
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,627
Harvey Pullman build this car
for you, Brandt?

96
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,034
George Vanderbilt's got a car on
the New York Central, cost him $50,000!

97
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,595
Got something
to show you, boys.

98
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:13,334
The Sharps Borchardt.

99
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,706
.54 caliber.
Finest rifle ever made.

100
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,836
Isn't that the gun
at Creedmoor International?

101
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:19,881
- In '77.
- That's right. And won it, too.

102
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:21,916
- Yeah.
- Is that some kind of telescope?

103
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:24,145
That is a telescope.
First time on a rifle.

104
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:27,188
Fires a center-fire cartridge
with the new Dupont gunpowder.

105
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:28,917
Accurate up to 800 yards.

106
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,152
800 yards?
Let me see that, Brandt.

107
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,888
Oh, come on, Brandt.
No gun has that range.

108
00:13:33,962 --> 00:13:35,361
It's a fact.
I can prove it.

109
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,330
I gotta see that kind of range
before I believe it.

110
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,730
What'd it cost?

111
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,131
$700 apiece.

112
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:42,534
It's a present for you boys.
There's one for each of you.

113
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:45,095
I thought it would add
a little something to the hunt.

114
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:48,075
Damn! That's the way
to run a hunting party!

115
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,297
Frank!

116
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,882
I think the girl wants to come over
and eat with us boys.

117
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,449
You heard
of the Loring bunch, ma'am.

118
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:37,188
Me and Hog figured
she wants to sit with us.

119
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,626
Have a little talk...
get to know each other.

120
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,160
Maybe later,
after supper, well...

121
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,459
She's fine right here, Jim.

122
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,663
Well, let's find that out.

123
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,473
Gimme that plate of food.
I'll carry it over to her.

124
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:10,217
Come on, lady!

125
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:12,283
You're gonna like
having supper with us.

126
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:18,996
Right in the back, Loring.

127
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,270
Think you got brains enough
to boss a range war?

128
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:40,183
The Macon County people
hired Frank, not you.

129
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:43,520
You'd still be rottin' in the Nogales jail
if it wasn't for him.

130
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,327
You dumb bastards.

131
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,299
You kill each other...

132
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,732
...then nobody's
gonna get any money.

133
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,111
'Cause any other chances we got...

134
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,353
...damn near all run out.

135
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:20,988
For everybody.

136
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,324
'Cause if we
don't make it this time...

137
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,670
...we ain't never gonna make it.

138
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:34,631
How's your jaw, Hog?

139
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:38,468
Oh, it's all right.

140
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,240
Hell, I like being kicked.

141
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,403
Oh, where shall I go?

142
00:17:08,477 --> 00:17:11,969
What can I do?

143
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:19,954
No one to tell me
what course to pursue

144
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:27,621
weary and footsore
and hungry and weak

145
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,540
Get undressed.

146
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,846
You like?

147
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,318
Chinese girl very good.

148
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:26,718
Very special.

149
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:30,389
I show you good time.

150
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:37,487
Oh, yeah.

151
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,429
Yeah, you're gonna show me
a good time, all right.

152
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:48,269
Yes, you're gonna show me
the best damn time I ever had.

153
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:49,503
Mr. Ruger...

154
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,571
No!

155
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:54,376
Please, Mr. Ruger!

156
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:27,706
You better get some sleep.

157
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,417
I'm not going to stay here.

158
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:43,328
And you ought to realize
there's no way you can keep me.

159
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:46,060
I am getting out of here
one way or another.

160
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,131
You go right ahead, lady.

161
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,692
Oh, God damn it, Frank.

162
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,826
Ain't we wore out enough without you
playing games with that woman?

163
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:24,698
We ride all day,
that saddle burning my ass...

164
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,764
You wanna bed down
with Crimp or me?

165
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,401
Bounty hunters shootin' at us
from every direction,

166
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,138
vigilantes, posses.

167
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:34,375
I don't know. Son of a bitch.
I don't know what it's all comin' to.

168
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,111
I never had a job
like this in my...

169
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,446
You ain't too bad.

170
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,792
For a schoolteacher.

171
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,023
If you think you're going to get
a lot of money for me, you're wrong.

172
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,130
They'll be coming
after us, you know.

173
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,532
A lot of men.

174
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:58,061
Why? They short of
teachers back there?

175
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,072
I am not a teacher.

176
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:06,303
I am Brandt Ruger's wife.

177
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,577
I am!

178
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:13,678
I am Brandt Ruger's wife!

179
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:20,286
It don't matter
whose wife you are.

180
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,193
There ain't nothin'
he can do about it.

181
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:31,498
Why do you want
to learn to read?

182
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:35,406
'Cause I can't.

183
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,322
Who the goddamn hell

184
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,590
would stop a train
in the middle of the goddamn night?

185
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,081
Brandt?

186
00:22:22,857 --> 00:22:25,690
Mr. Ruger,
your wife's been kidnapped.

187
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:31,161
Sheriff says Frank Calder took her
and they're headed north.

188
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:09,930
Ever kill a man, Matt?

189
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:18,345
No! Not actually.

190
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:23,112
This'll do it.
Seven... eight hundred yards.

191
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:25,516
Winchester's good for 350 yards.

192
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,385
Jesus Christ Himself
couldn't get any more range out of it.

193
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:30,185
This is 800.

194
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,886
What exactly
are you getting at, Brandt?

195
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:36,519
A little hunting trip.

196
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:38,657
If you mean
help the posse, Brandt...

197
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,223
I mean, we're all gonna help.

198
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:42,531
He's not thinking
about helping anybody.

199
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:46,173
Hang back and pick 'em off,
like trailing bear.

200
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:48,641
- That's right.
- That Calder bunch?

201
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,339
Why, they're hired gunfighters.
More than 20 of 'em.

202
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:55,905
Jim Loring, the Thompson brothers,
Hog Warren, Doc Harrison...

203
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,711
You mean to say
that we go up against them?

204
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:00,118
Up close, no.

205
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,980
But from a distance.

206
00:25:07,956 --> 00:25:11,289
Come on, honey.
You're gonna get it!

207
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,253
Come on!

208
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,021
It's gonna be all right, Brandt.

209
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:20,091
There'll be...
some kind of ransom.

210
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,493
A note. Something.

211
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:25,157
You pay it,
and Melissa'll be back with you,

212
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,292
and it'll be all over.

213
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:28,835
How old a man is Calder?

214
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:31,933
30... 34, maybe.

215
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:37,576
Is he a big man?

216
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,670
About average, I guess.

217
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:44,207
Melissa is gonna be all right.

218
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:45,946
You've gotta believe that.

219
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,078
Oh, sure.

220
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:48,416
Maybe he'll give her a kid,

221
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,957
and I'll have an outlaw bastard
running 'round the house.

222
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,858
Jesus Christ, Brandt.
Out of respect for Melissa!

223
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:56,624
What the hell do you think he's gonna
do with her... sing church hymns?

224
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:58,665
I guess I know
how you feel, but...

225
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,132
He's gonna pass her 'round.

226
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:02,795
After he's through with that,
maybe 15 or 20 of 'em.

227
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,670
He'll accept 40 or $50,000
of my money. Thank you very much.

228
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:07,799
Now, hold on!

229
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:12,039
My Virginia-educated, butter-wouldn't-
melt in-her-mouth wife used like a whore!

230
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:15,310
Then I have to take her back
pregnant with a bastard!

231
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:18,477
And pay him $50,000
of my goddamn money?!

232
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:24,518
I'll kill every dirty,
living, bastard of them.

233
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:42,367
Mornin'.

234
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:50,080
Baldy made some flapjacks.
You want some?

235
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:54,682
- Where's...
- Frank?

236
00:32:55,623 --> 00:32:58,114
He's fixin' a boil
on Joe Butler's horse.

237
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,361
Did you sleep all right?

238
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,732
Well, at least you ain't
so scared anymore, right?

239
00:33:13,974 --> 00:33:17,034
You know, me and Frank...
we been together five or six years.

240
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:21,680
He ain't what other people see
on the outside.

241
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:29,782
They call me Doc.

242
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,519
Go on.

243
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:34,958
Hot coffee'll do ya good.

244
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,970
Sure is good sorghum.

245
00:34:00,054 --> 00:34:01,214
You ready?

246
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:30,172
You can start.

247
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,149
Might as well start.

248
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:46,126
If you're lookin' for me
to say I'm sorry...

249
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:48,596
...about last night...

250
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,528
I can't.

251
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:53,301
'Cause I'm not.

252
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,411
Injun gets his eyes
on a woman...

253
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:41,649
he either buys her...
or he takes her.

254
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:45,689
You got took.

255
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:00,437
Now, you sit there.

256
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:10,640
Frank, there she goes!

257
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:25,964
Go get her, Frank!

258
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,667
You caught yourself
a mountain lion, boy!

259
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,453
You're not goin' anywhere
till you teach me to read.

260
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:27,716
Who do you think you are...
the Lord of Creation?

261
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,127
Grabbin' anybody you want,
doin' anything you want?

262
00:37:30,197 --> 00:37:32,188
You're nothing but an animal!

263
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:35,793
You don't eat
until you teach me.

264
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,831
All right, I don't eat.

265
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:40,669
See what that gets you!

266
00:39:00,554 --> 00:39:01,816
Come on, guys!

267
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:27,010
Let's go, God damn it!
Let's go!

268
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:46,997
You hungry?

269
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:56,372
Sure is good beans.

270
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:09,545
Well, you might as well start, huh?

271
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,086
Hey, Matt,
look over there.

272
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:54,366
Gotta be a couple of days
ahead of us.

273
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:57,597
We gonna bed down for the night?
Be dark before long.

274
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:59,730
Well, whatever Brandt says.

275
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,672
We're not there yet!

276
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:03,232
Come on. Come on!

277
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:10,206
I've been...

278
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,006
I've been saving these.

279
00:42:15,515 --> 00:42:17,005
For...

280
00:42:18,418 --> 00:42:19,749
...somethin' special.

281
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:38,634
Well, now then.

282
00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:40,195
If we can just...

283
00:42:41,775 --> 00:42:42,935
...get a little...

284
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:45,640
...get a little top off of this...

285
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:03,287
Hey, Doc...

286
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:04,762
you like peaches?

287
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,932
Oh... yeah!

288
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:46,632
Oh, boy.

289
00:44:28,348 --> 00:44:29,747
You like peaches?

290
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:42,786
Do you know any
of the alphabet, at least?

291
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,016
No!

292
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:22,459
"C."

293
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,360
That's a "C."

294
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:27,423
"A, B, C."

295
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:30,926
"A"...and "B"...

296
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:33,669
...and that one there's a "C"?

297
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:40,873
You teach her anything
last night, Frank?

298
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:44,140
In the bushes?

299
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:56,721
"A"...and "B"...

300
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:58,286
and that's "C."

301
00:48:30,257 --> 00:48:32,191
Shouldn't you wait till he's...

302
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:43,429
Doc, get 'em over there
in the canyon.

303
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,494
Loring, Hog!
Get out of here, fast!

304
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:47,062
Mooney, down on the right!

305
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:05,416
Collins! Ted!
Come and get Stringer!

306
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:34,051
Hey... Jesus Christ!
I think that's Calder!

307
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,011
He's all yours, Brandt.

308
00:50:05,985 --> 00:50:07,714
Hey, there go the rest of them.

309
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,309
The ridge?

310
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:12,143
Ain't no son of a bitch
shoot from that far.

311
00:51:53,092 --> 00:51:54,753
Go! Go! Go!

312
00:52:57,791 --> 00:52:59,782
This one's still alive.

313
00:53:04,965 --> 00:53:07,126
By God, you dropped
two of 'em, Brandt.

314
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:10,626
You should've got Calder, though.

315
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,441
Not like...
killing an animal.

316
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:20,506
Is it?

317
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:30,947
Who the hell
do you suppose they are?

318
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,017
You think it'd be Joe Taylor?

319
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,515
No gun shoots that far.

320
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:42,994
That old boy followed me damn near
two years. Kept poppin' up.

321
00:54:43,063 --> 00:54:46,123
No gun shoots that far.

322
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:48,928
You think it's
that sheriff from Nogales?

323
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:56,336
It's sure as hell somebody.
Pinkertons, law...

324
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,745
Hank's dead.

325
00:55:52,999 --> 00:55:54,990
I'll go put him in the shade.

326
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:32,535
Frank!

327
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:51,986
What do ya think?

328
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:01,166
Well, he won't be fooled.

329
00:57:02,102 --> 00:57:03,933
That's for sure.

330
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,905
Who the hell could it be?

331
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,002
One son of a bitch?

332
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:41,667
Oh! It feels good.

333
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,212
Frank!

334
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:07,964
"B" has got two bellies.

335
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,869
And a bar.

336
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:19,409
And "C,"
it's not all the way round.

337
00:58:19,479 --> 00:58:20,639
Frank.

338
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:25,075
He's still out there.
Owney's watching him.

339
00:58:27,153 --> 00:58:28,643
Yeah, all right, Doc.

340
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:35,658
Now the "D."

341
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:42,062
That's a belly...
and a bar.

342
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:48,897
Here's the "E."

343
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:55,074
Yeah, that's a lot
like an Indian sign.

344
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:01,009
"F" like in Frank.

345
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,450
Hell. I'll soon be able
to write my name.

346
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:09,790
"F"...

347
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:12,095
...for Frank.

348
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:21,897
"F"...

349
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,966
"R"...

350
00:59:24,044 --> 00:59:25,375
"A"...

351
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:26,673
"N"...

352
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:28,407
"K."

353
00:59:30,884 --> 00:59:32,044
Frank.

354
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:36,482
Melissa.

355
00:59:42,128 --> 00:59:43,527
We gotta go.

356
01:00:07,454 --> 01:00:09,615
Frank! Water up ahead!

357
01:00:21,735 --> 01:00:23,225
You watch him, Owney.

358
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:23,962
Get out of here!

359
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:26,123
Get out of here!

360
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,491
Run!

361
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:34,931
Get out of the way!

362
01:01:36,409 --> 01:01:38,673
Get out of here!

363
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,141
Get out!

364
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,618
Get out!

365
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:51,179
Get the hell out of here!

366
01:01:59,399 --> 01:02:01,731
Owney, get out of here!

367
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:17,682
Get out of the water!

368
01:02:18,685 --> 01:02:20,414
Let's get out of here!

369
01:02:23,857 --> 01:02:25,154
Get out of the water!

370
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,420
Let's go!

371
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,985
Shit, Doc!

372
01:02:46,379 --> 01:02:48,244
Get him on his horse!

373
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:51,246
Move, Doc!

374
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:54,746
- Get out of here!
- Move!

375
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:57,255
Get out of the way! Move!

376
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:59,267
Damn, Doc!
That cracker neck laid one in you!

377
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:00,505
Hold on.

378
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:06,514
Crimp! Gimme some water!

379
01:05:06,586 --> 01:05:07,917
Hold on there, Doc.

380
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,319
Come on,
let's get Doc in the wagon.

381
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,490
Come on, then.

382
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,959
Out of the way!

383
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:17,690
Come on, Ray.
Come on.

384
01:05:17,764 --> 01:05:18,924
- Frank?
- Get up!

385
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,989
- Am I gonna die?
- No, you're not.

386
01:05:24,771 --> 01:05:25,931
Doc.

387
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,336
Some water.

388
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:28,897
Son of a bitch.

389
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:30,806
God damn it.

390
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,249
Well, whoever the hell
it is back there...

391
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:41,709
...we gotta keep out
ahead of 'em.

392
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:44,479
We gotta keep movin'.

393
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:48,654
Must be...
a posse or somethin'.

394
01:05:51,464 --> 01:05:53,398
We don't have any other choice.

395
01:05:59,672 --> 01:06:02,004
- Hey!
- No, Frank!

396
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:03,565
That's Brandt!

397
01:06:03,643 --> 01:06:05,975
I'm Brandt Ruger's wife!

398
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,706
No!

399
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,941
I don't belong here!

400
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,217
He'll kill you!

401
01:06:23,296 --> 01:06:26,026
No! He'll kill you!

402
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:27,691
It's him!

403
01:06:27,767 --> 01:06:29,962
Is that who she is?

404
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:34,500
Calder, is that who she is?

405
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,166
Well, is it?

406
01:06:49,288 --> 01:06:52,052
Men gettin' killed
on account of you takin' a woman?

407
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:55,287
Mooney and all them others...

408
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:57,420
...gettin' killed for that?!

409
01:06:57,497 --> 01:06:59,158
Let her go, Frank.

410
01:07:00,466 --> 01:07:02,195
Let her go.

411
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,997
You get rid of her
or I will!

412
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:15,839
What the hell are we waitin'
here for, you sons of bitches?

413
01:07:15,915 --> 01:07:17,644
Let's get movin'!

414
01:07:53,252 --> 01:07:55,743
Jesus Christ, Brandt!
Stop it!

415
01:07:56,355 --> 01:07:59,051
Why?
What's wrong?

416
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:03,023
They're not game we bagged.
They're seven men.

417
01:08:03,095 --> 01:08:04,460
Human beings!

418
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:46,129
I judge it about half a mile.

419
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,121
They're right out in the open.

420
01:09:11,197 --> 01:09:13,188
Let's move up
and pick off a few more.

421
01:09:13,966 --> 01:09:15,126
No...

422
01:09:16,536 --> 01:09:17,696
No.

423
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:20,438
That'd put us out in the open.

424
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,271
We'll just stay out of sight.

425
01:09:23,342 --> 01:09:25,674
Just hit and run.

426
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,011
- Brandt... that man's finished.
- It's a neck shot.

427
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:39,182
- Hundred dollars says...
- He can't poss...

428
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,050
Luis, get the pack horses!

429
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,324
- Brandt, look!
- Drop his horse!

430
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:17,947
...see a long-legged sailor
with a long-legged wife?

431
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:22,358
Did you ever
in your long-legged life...

432
01:12:29,295 --> 01:12:31,024
Come on, Sam.
That's enough.

433
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,833
Well, his family may wanna move him,
but for right now...

434
01:12:38,904 --> 01:12:40,303
Come on. Come on!

435
01:12:40,372 --> 01:12:41,999
That's Watt Nelson!

436
01:12:42,074 --> 01:12:44,042
And he's dead, God damn it!

437
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:46,101
What do you mean,
"He's dead"?

438
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:48,772
He owns the biggest bank
in New Orleans, half of Louisiana...

439
01:12:48,848 --> 01:12:50,816
He's not
some goddamn hired hand!

440
01:12:50,883 --> 01:12:52,373
You ready?

441
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:02,553
I told you to do the right thing.
Get some help out here.

442
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:05,556
You ready, Buford?

443
01:13:08,567 --> 01:13:10,728
Get on your horse, Buford.

444
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,067
Leave him alone.
He's got a family.

445
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,130
For God's sakes...
we both have!

446
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:17,598
I'm sorry about Melissa.

447
01:13:17,676 --> 01:13:21,407
But that's no reason to run
around this country like crazy people.

448
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,210
It might make more sense,
Brandt, if we just...

449
01:13:24,283 --> 01:13:26,342
You bastards!

450
01:14:04,323 --> 01:14:07,258
- I'll need a skinnier knife.
- Hell, Frank. Leave it in.

451
01:14:07,326 --> 01:14:08,657
A real skinny knife.

452
01:14:08,727 --> 01:14:12,060
Charlie Ferguson had a piece of lead
in him for 20 years. Never hurt him any.

453
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:14,429
Doc, how do you say knife?
Skinny knife.

454
01:14:15,467 --> 01:14:17,128
<i>Otra navaja</i>.

455
01:14:21,073 --> 01:14:23,064
I don't want you
pokin' around in there, Frank.

456
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,614
Hell, I ain't dead yet,
God damn it.

457
01:14:43,028 --> 01:14:45,360
Hold still, Doc.
I nearly had it.

458
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,726
I don't want you
messin' around with my guts!

459
01:14:51,804 --> 01:14:54,136
Yeah? Well,
you're not drunk enough yet.

460
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,420
Hog, where you goin'?
Come back inside.

461
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:12,980
I'm gonna get me a woman.

462
01:15:13,058 --> 01:15:14,787
They're all hid up.
Come on back.

463
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,351
Well, I'll just dig me one up
'cause I need it!

464
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:20,421
Don't you like that old guitar music?
Come on! Let's get on back.

465
01:15:20,499 --> 01:15:23,832
Shit! You'd think a town this size
would have some whores.

466
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:25,393
Hey! I gotta have me a woman!

467
01:15:25,471 --> 01:15:26,802
Whore!

468
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:46,811
You're supposed to be
my goddamn friend and...

469
01:16:48,487 --> 01:16:50,648
You're cuttin' my goddamn liver out!

470
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:54,882
Hold still or I'm
gonna tear something.

471
01:16:58,797 --> 01:17:02,699
Oh, Frank,
just leave the goddamn...

472
01:17:10,075 --> 01:17:11,565
Almost had it.

473
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:18,772
Well...

474
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,312
Oh, no!

475
01:17:24,123 --> 01:17:25,715
Shit. Hold it!

476
01:18:00,325 --> 01:18:02,657
Ain't you a pretty little thing?

477
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:05,128
Yeah... oh, yeah.

478
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:07,528
Get right up there.

479
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:18,199
You're gonna like this.

480
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,938
Yes, sir.

481
01:18:26,418 --> 01:18:28,409
Come on, now.
Don't be like that!

482
01:18:30,923 --> 01:18:32,584
- Look what I got for you!
- Frank!

483
01:18:32,658 --> 01:18:34,319
- Come on out of there!
- Frank!

484
01:18:34,393 --> 01:18:36,054
Cut out that goddamn screaming!

485
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,959
- Frank!
- Come out of there!

486
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,978
Get... get over here!

487
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:01,150
Now, God damn it,
we're gonna...

488
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:47,462
Oh, shit, Frank.

489
01:20:10,289 --> 01:20:13,281
You bastard!
Oh, you bastard!

490
01:20:13,358 --> 01:20:14,518
Bastard!

491
01:20:34,213 --> 01:20:35,544
I'm sorry.

492
01:20:39,017 --> 01:20:40,507
I'm sorry.

493
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:43,977
I'm so sorry.

494
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,081
I'm so sorry.

495
01:20:50,729 --> 01:20:52,060
Frank?

496
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,529
Where will we go?

497
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:56,230
California, maybe.

498
01:20:56,301 --> 01:20:57,461
Frank?

499
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,003
What's gonna happen to us?

500
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:08,139
Oh... you know somethin'?

501
01:21:08,213 --> 01:21:10,044
I might end up

502
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,573
one of the biggest ranchers
out of Lincoln county.

503
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,082
And...

504
01:21:18,156 --> 01:21:21,819
And I might even learn
to teach at school myself.

505
01:21:24,563 --> 01:21:28,556
Why don't you teach people
not to steal... other people?

506
01:21:35,574 --> 01:21:39,908
You know, back there someplace,
I thought maybe...

507
01:21:40,879 --> 01:21:44,042
...I could have something
to tie onto.

508
01:21:44,116 --> 01:21:45,515
And...

509
01:21:47,452 --> 01:21:51,548
And aim for something a little better
than what there was.

510
01:21:52,424 --> 01:21:54,255
And so, for a start,

511
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:55,816
I decided...

512
01:21:57,029 --> 01:21:58,860
...I was gonna learn to read.

513
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,764
You smell like a horse.

514
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,391
I'm Brandt Ruger.

515
01:23:05,764 --> 01:23:07,755
The woman's husband.

516
01:23:14,373 --> 01:23:16,864
Brandt Ruger.

517
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:22,343
She's a...

518
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:29,014
...hell of a woman.

519
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,488
Which way are they heading?

520
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,753
Frank sure...

521
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:42,299
picked a good looker for hisself.

522
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:45,662
Are they going through Mesa
or toward the valley?

523
01:23:48,306 --> 01:23:51,469
I Believe...

524
01:23:51,543 --> 01:23:52,976
Mesa.

525
01:23:53,879 --> 01:23:55,141
Mesa.

526
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,582
He's gettin' at it real good.

527
01:24:04,656 --> 01:24:06,988
She likes it.

528
01:24:07,058 --> 01:24:08,389
Let's go, Brandt.

529
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,291
- She likes it!
- Let's go, Brandt.

530
01:24:10,362 --> 01:24:14,355
Look, we can cut across and get there
before Calder does. Come on.

531
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:16,230
Come on, Brandt!

532
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:19,835
First time, he forced her.

533
01:24:19,905 --> 01:24:22,396
Then she got
where she kept wanting it

534
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,409
more and more and more...

535
01:25:07,886 --> 01:25:11,549
I hope that doctor has
plenty of mescal on hand.

536
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,169
I'll go see
if there's a doctor.

537
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,998
Frank!

538
01:26:55,226 --> 01:26:56,386
Brandt!

539
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,289
Give it up!

540
01:27:06,404 --> 01:27:09,237
It doesn't make sense anymore!

541
01:27:12,777 --> 01:27:13,835
Brandt?

542
01:27:16,848 --> 01:27:19,180
You saw.

543
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,717
Let her go!

544
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:43,965
Brandt!

545
01:27:47,078 --> 01:27:48,238
Brandt!

546
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:27,110
Owney.

547
01:29:04,823 --> 01:29:05,983
Doc?

548
01:29:18,136 --> 01:29:19,296
Doc?

549
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:28,639
How ya doin'?

550
01:29:30,582 --> 01:29:32,413
Feelin' horny some.

551
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,254
Take your gun out, Frank.

552
01:29:41,326 --> 01:29:42,691
Slow.

553
01:29:48,933 --> 01:29:50,924
Take it out.

554
01:29:57,175 --> 01:29:58,335
No!

555
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,076
You got
damn near everybody killed.

556
01:30:06,551 --> 01:30:09,645
Now, Crimp's gonna ride back
and find that man...

557
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:11,552
and tell him
he can have the woman.

558
01:30:15,293 --> 01:30:17,227
We're gonna get $10,000

559
01:30:17,295 --> 01:30:18,956
like we ought to.

560
01:30:20,298 --> 01:30:23,631
Will you quit hittin' me in the side
of the head with that damn gun barrel?

561
01:30:24,269 --> 01:30:26,601
Stop it!
I'll do whatever you want!

562
01:30:27,438 --> 01:30:30,373
I was gonna let you
get your ass outta here...

563
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:32,773
but what I oughtta do
is blow a hole in ya.

564
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,471
You shit-eating bastard!

565
01:31:58,129 --> 01:31:59,790
I can't make it, Frank.

566
01:32:00,965 --> 01:32:02,956
It ain't much further now, Doc.

567
01:32:04,135 --> 01:32:05,295
A little more than a day.

568
01:32:11,476 --> 01:32:13,137
We get to the mountains...

569
01:32:14,078 --> 01:32:15,670
...up there in the trees.

570
01:32:17,148 --> 01:32:18,809
His rifle ain't no good out there.

571
01:32:19,684 --> 01:32:21,083
I can't.

572
01:32:23,021 --> 01:32:25,012
We can hold out there, Doc.

573
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,522
Hell, we're gonna make it.

574
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:27,751
No.

575
01:32:28,593 --> 01:32:31,323
Frank, please, listen.
Listen.

576
01:32:33,564 --> 01:32:36,055
Ain't no good
stringing it out like this.

577
01:32:36,935 --> 01:32:38,266
The pain is...

578
01:32:47,045 --> 01:32:48,205
Frank...

579
01:32:50,415 --> 01:32:51,905
Your gun, huh?

580
01:32:55,086 --> 01:32:57,247
Shit...

581
01:32:57,322 --> 01:32:59,654
You gotta get me
out of this misery.

582
01:33:02,627 --> 01:33:05,289
I'll go...
get you some mescal.

583
01:33:05,363 --> 01:33:06,421
Frank.

584
01:33:50,074 --> 01:33:53,669
I'll...
go get you some mescal.

585
01:33:54,979 --> 01:33:56,640
Take your mind off things.

586
01:33:57,482 --> 01:33:59,313
Ease the pain a little.

587
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:05,587
Now, don't you go away,
you horny bastard.

588
01:34:11,095 --> 01:34:12,926
'Cause I'm gonna be right back.

589
01:34:25,443 --> 01:34:26,933
Doc!

590
01:36:54,025 --> 01:36:55,185
Frank?

591
01:37:00,198 --> 01:37:01,358
Frank?

592
01:37:05,136 --> 01:37:07,866
Remember you said something
about California?

593
01:37:11,842 --> 01:37:13,173
Let's go.

594
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,404
Now.

595
01:37:20,218 --> 01:37:22,209
Well, we got
a pretty good spot right here.

596
01:37:28,726 --> 01:37:29,886
Game.

597
01:37:32,797 --> 01:37:34,628
And there's only one way in.

598
01:37:38,002 --> 01:37:39,663
- And Owney and Crimp, they won't...
- No.

599
01:37:40,304 --> 01:37:42,636
Frank. Us.

600
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:44,868
Wherever you want.

601
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:46,933
But just us.

602
01:37:59,357 --> 01:38:01,188
There's only one way outta here.

603
01:38:04,662 --> 01:38:05,822
Desert.

604
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:10,790
Nobody ever goes there.

605
01:38:10,868 --> 01:38:12,699
But he couldn't follow us.

606
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:14,931
Frank?

607
01:40:08,619 --> 01:40:10,450
Kill us.

608
01:40:11,522 --> 01:40:13,183
Kill us.

609
01:40:14,692 --> 01:40:17,217
Kill us!

610
01:40:18,229 --> 01:40:19,719
Kill us!

611
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:23,060
Kill us!

612
01:40:23,134 --> 01:40:24,192
Please.

613
01:40:24,368 --> 01:40:26,632
Please!

614
01:40:27,304 --> 01:40:28,965
Please?

615
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:30,529
Kill us!

616
01:40:32,009 --> 01:40:33,408
Kill us.

617
01:40:36,147 --> 01:40:37,978
Kill us...

618
01:41:01,505 --> 01:41:02,836
Melissa.

619
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:13,076
Melissa.

620
01:41:33,737 --> 01:41:35,466
Plum trees.

621
01:41:36,474 --> 01:41:38,305
I like plum trees.

622
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:44,577
The kind when the leaves
are a kind of...

623
01:41:44,648 --> 01:41:45,979
purple.

624
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:49,516
We had plum trees.

625
01:41:50,988 --> 01:41:54,651
And... grapes.

626
01:41:54,725 --> 01:41:56,317
We had grapes...

627
01:41:57,394 --> 01:41:59,055
...along the back.

628
01:42:01,799 --> 01:42:04,131
You think they have grapes
in California?

629
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:10,867
I wanted a boy.

630
01:42:12,343 --> 01:42:14,004
And then a girl.

631
01:42:17,414 --> 01:42:19,473
Plum trees
are nice in the spring.

632
01:42:24,021 --> 01:42:29,425
They probably got...
more... trees...

633
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,052
...and orchards...

634
01:42:34,298 --> 01:42:36,129
...in California...

635
01:42:38,502 --> 01:42:40,436
...than almost anywhere else.

636
01:42:58,088 --> 01:42:59,419
Here.

637
01:43:00,357 --> 01:43:01,517
Come on.

638
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,999
Don't worry.

639
01:43:13,671 --> 01:43:15,161
I'll get us out of here.

640
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:18,434
I promise.

641
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:22,606
Oh, hell.

642
01:43:29,186 --> 01:43:31,916
It's the craziest idea
anybody ever had.

643
01:43:34,692 --> 01:43:35,852
Taking somebody.

644
01:43:40,598 --> 01:43:42,259
When I was a kid,

645
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:44,267
my old man, he...

646
01:43:47,838 --> 01:43:50,568
Well, that son of a bitch,
he could read.

647
01:43:52,409 --> 01:43:53,740
And I wouldn't.

648
01:43:57,648 --> 01:43:58,979
I wouldn't.

649
01:44:02,086 --> 01:44:03,747
You understand?

650
01:44:05,723 --> 01:44:09,454
I'm so...
goddamn sorry.

651
01:44:13,263 --> 01:44:14,924
We had apples.

652
01:44:15,899 --> 01:44:20,495
And... and in the spring,
there were blossoms.

653
01:44:21,805 --> 01:44:25,400
And the leaves
were soft, sort of.

654
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:28,271
They blew in the wind.

655
01:44:30,014 --> 01:44:31,948
And the blossoms were white.

656
01:45:13,323 --> 01:45:16,486
Did you ever

657
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,223
In your long-legged life

658
01:45:23,767 --> 01:45:30,605
Dream of a long-legged sailor

659
01:45:33,444 --> 01:45:39,110
With a long-legged wife?

660
01:45:40,484 --> 01:45:44,477
I dreamt of my mother

661
01:46:15,219 --> 01:46:16,379
Frank?

662
01:46:19,056 --> 01:46:20,216
Yeah?

663
01:46:22,526 --> 01:46:25,359
If we can just get a little...
