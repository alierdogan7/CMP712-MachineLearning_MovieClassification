1
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,680
It's hard to grow old
in the dust of the prairie

2
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,308
And a man can't grow old

3
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:47,030
where there's women and gold.

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,803
The story is told
in the dust of the prairie

5
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:58,416
That a man can't grow old

6
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,910
where there's women and gold.

7
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,311
There's a stranger in town

8
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,194
where a stranger ain't welcome.

9
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,561
He should take some advice

10
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:38,705
and turn right around.

11
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:42,510
The stranger should flee.

12
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,741
Go back where he came from.

13
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,355
And live a long life

14
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:53,544
away from this town.

15
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:56,843
And live a long life

16
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,061
away from this town.

17
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,540
Evening, stranger.

18
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,873
You must know everybody in town.

19
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:07,313
Everybody but one. Don't know you.

20
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,901
You do now.

21
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:10,585
Got a vacant room?

22
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:13,075
- By day, week or month?
- I do not know.

23
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:15,871
Because the way you look at it,
a man can't be too sure in this town.

24
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:18,567
I've been here six years
and I ain't dead yet.

25
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:22,219
I'll settle for a week.
Eight dollars cash in advance.

26
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:26,678
- From Kansas, eh?
- No.

27
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,731
Always put on where I'm going
next so I won't forget.

28
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,744
Room 10 at the end of the hall.

29
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,529
Make your own bed.
Furnish your own towel.

30
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,828
Your grip's where you dropped it.

31
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,162
Thanks for the key.

32
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,209
Seven loses.

33
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,769
All right. Get your bets down, boys.
Get your bets down!

34
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,904
Number seven, the winner.

35
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,960
Get your money down, boys.
The man's getting lucky.

36
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,230
Eleven. The man wins.
Get your bets down.

37
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:03,056
All right, boys. Cover your bets now.

38
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:06,274
Eight's your point.
Number eight's your point.

39
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,195
He's my man.

40
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,945
We can take a come bet on that.

41
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:11,161
Eight the hard way.

42
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,562
No thanks. Here you go, dealer.

43
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,174
Next shoot.

44
00:05:26,345 --> 00:05:30,815
Sometime remind me to tell you

45
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:36,883
how much you mean to me.

46
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:43,024
Sometime remind me to tell you

47
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:49,139
how happy we could be.

48
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:54,694
Sometime remind me to whisper

49
00:05:55,413 --> 00:06:01,532
each dream, each plan, each promise.

50
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:08,841
But why wait around for sometime?

51
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:15,595
Why don't you tell me now?

52
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,656
A whiskey,
like you pour it for yourself.

53
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:25,882
Don't you know it's no fun
to drink alone?

54
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:27,553
Not till after the first one.

55
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:31,833
You a stranger here?

56
00:06:35,857 --> 00:06:37,429
What kind of whiskey was that?

57
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,089
On the bottle, it says rye.

58
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,853
The way you take it, I don't
see what difference it makes.

59
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,138
I'll have another rye.

60
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,970
You haven't answered my question.

61
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,034
I am a stranger everywhere.

62
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:48,478
Got a job?

63
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,214
Listen, fella. I know that one too.
"Got a job, stranger?"

64
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,582
Not? Why don't you join the army.

65
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,394
Three meals a day and a place to sleep.

66
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,091
"A nice warm uniform..."

67
00:06:58,092 --> 00:06:59,426
It's a little more than that.

68
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,803
Yeah, there's one thing more
that I could never take.

69
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,065
It's got second lieutenants.

70
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,794
You want to make this a
personal matter, all right?

71
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,250
I don't make it anything, soldier.

72
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,655
You tried to sell me something.
I didn't buy it.

73
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:12,856
Why don't you beat it?

74
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:15,601
If I weren't wearing uniform,
I might teach you a few manners.

75
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,674
If you could teach me anything,
you wouldn't be in a uniform.

76
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,146
You couldn't be looking
for trouble, could you?

77
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,201
- I could, but I'm not.
- That's fine.

78
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:30,168
Because this is one of the best places
west of the Atlantic Ocean to find them.

79
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:31,790
That was my first impression.

80
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,900
That lieutenant is a nice young boy.

81
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,911
I don't doubt it.
But his mouth is too big.

82
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,414
Like your ears.

83
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,661
The view is much
better at this table.

84
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:57,589
And you must like to pick fights.

85
00:07:57,705 --> 00:07:59,346
Only with second lieutenants.

86
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,339
We like second lieutenants here.

87
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:04,626
You see here everybody
fights except the army.

88
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,017
I wouldn't know.

89
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,714
So anyone who doesn't like the army...

90
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:09,857
I know what you mean.

91
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:13,068
But I'm afraid I'll have to come back.
You see I...

92
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,009
I like the way you sing.

93
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,410
Captain Iles, commander of the post.

94
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,610
Mr. Haven, sir.

95
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,832
Lieutenant, I see you finally got here.

96
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,513
I seem to finally get everywhere.

97
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,008
Mrs. Caslon, Mr. Haven.

98
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,533
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

99
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:47,586
You met Mr. Stellman.

100
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,206
It came off beautifully, sir.

101
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,600
He picks a good fight.

102
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,309
Matter of fact.
I think I am still a little sore at him.

103
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,432
- Sit down, Mr. Haven.
- Thank you, Captain.

104
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,734
So you're operating under sealed orders.

105
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,823
All this mumbo-jumbo is characteristic
of the Military Information Department.

106
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:07,981
We try to use it as sparingly
as possible.

107
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,440
I've been in this territory
for a number of years.

108
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,218
I think you'll find it a little rougher
here than the suburbs of Washington DC.

109
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,625
Very sensibly.

110
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,971
Then why is M.I.D. sending you here?

111
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,321
Because two soldiers have been murdered.

112
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:23,412
Those two soldiers were killed
while escorting one of the gold stakes.

113
00:10:23,802 --> 00:10:26,764
Is escorting gold
one of the functions of your command?

114
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,443
Young man, the functions
of my command look very pretty on paper.

115
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:34,118
But they are not very practical
in a territory like this.

116
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:36,876
What's happening to the gold?

117
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,851
I permitted it to be stored
on a warehouse on the post.

118
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,292
Captain, you're in a bad way.

119
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,447
Wells Fargo won't convoy gold.

120
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:46,972
You tried and failed. Two men are dead.

121
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:50,423
Gold's piling up at your post.
You can't move it.

122
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:51,791
The post is undermanned.

123
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:54,811
You want the quartermaster's
plague to replace 7 uniforms.

124
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:56,833
Sent to the freight
office in West Rim City.

125
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,818
The freight building burned
down with the uniforms.

126
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:00,601
I'm not operating a fire department.

127
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:03,028
And if I were,
West Rim City is 60 miles away.

128
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,407
- That doesn't concern me either.
- Well what does?

129
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,445
The killing of two soldiers.

130
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,570
They were my men, Haven.

131
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,901
I'm trying every way I know
to find out who murdered them.

132
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,693
- So will I.
- It may be harder than you think.

133
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,332
I don't know how you operate.

134
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,048
But this is a dangerous job
that can get you killed.

135
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,164
You make it sound very
difficult, Captain.

136
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,016
Why don't you just wrap up your flag
and take it back east with you?

137
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:25,873
- Look here, Lieutenant.
- Yes?

138
00:11:27,547 --> 00:11:28,968
How will I know what you're doing?

139
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:30,869
I'll let you know from time to time.

140
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,576
That's very obliging of you.

141
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:35,572
One thing. I don't want
to visit the army post.

142
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,258
Then report to me through
Mrs. Caslon here.

143
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,851
You can be a friend of her husband.

144
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:42,139
He owned the Argus mine
and died last year.

145
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:44,298
If that meets with your approval.

146
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:48,019
Only if it meets with hers.

147
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:49,702
I'd be delighted to help.

148
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,255
- Is that all?
- Yes, I think so.

149
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,095
He really isn't that abrupt.

150
00:12:00,696 --> 00:12:03,490
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night, George.

151
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,395
- Do you see?
- I see.

152
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,374
I think he secretly likes you.

153
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,429
The commander can
certainly keep a secret.

154
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:15,457
- Would you like a little sherry?
- Only if you'll have some too.

155
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,668
Excuse me.

156
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:22,643
What mine were the two soldiers
trying to convoy gold from?

157
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,073
The Argus. It belongs to me.

158
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:27,857
That brings me to a question
I'd decided not to ask.

159
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:29,122
Then I'll answer it first.

160
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,942
Captain Isles has asked me to marry him.

161
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,239
I can understand that.

162
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:36,283
But you can't understand why Capt. Isles
should be involved in the gold business.

163
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:37,498
I do now.

164
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,131
You must realize there's
a lot of gold from

165
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:45,007
all over the territory
stored at the post warehouse.

166
00:12:45,177 --> 00:12:48,262
- How much would you say?
- Perhaps as much as half a million.

167
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:51,410
In fact, I have about
$50,000 in my safe now.

168
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:55,810
Really? Tell me, who is
taking all this the gold?

169
00:12:56,577 --> 00:13:01,288
I don't know. That's
the worst part of it, not knowing.

170
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:02,770
That I might find out.

171
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:05,821
- Don't get into trouble.
- That's why I'm here.

172
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,814
- I know, but does not get...
- Do not worry it.

173
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,949
Trouble and I are old enemies.
We understand each other.

174
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:14,992
- Good night, Mrs. Caslon.
- Good luck.

175
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:23,072
How happy we could be...

176
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:41,230
Every time I come in here you
stop singing. Why is it?

177
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,791
You don't have to come in.

178
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:46,061
Look, I didn't come back
to start a fight. Or break the bank.

179
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,568
Why did you come back?

180
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,731
If you invited me to sit down,
I might find out.

181
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,074
It might be better if you
found another table.

182
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:55,554
And another girl.

183
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:58,347
Oh no, it wouldn't. I looked.

184
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,276
- Could that be Charlie?
- No.

185
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,671
His eyes follow you around
like a couple of flies.

186
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,112
They follow me around to see
that strangers don't annoy me.

187
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,861
- Only strangers?
- No one else would be so foolish.

188
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:23,045
Waiter, bring me
a bottle of wine, will you?

189
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,374
First you are beautiful.
Then I like the way you sing.

190
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,005
And now you're a woman of mystery.

191
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,627
I don't want to be a stranger.
So I'll have to be foolish.

192
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,357
- You like to take chances, don't you?
- If I feel lucky.

193
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,577
I advise you to try the dice table.

194
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,645
I'd rather get lucky here.

195
00:14:41,286 --> 00:14:43,543
Every man has a right
to his own funeral.

196
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,570
I could be your cousin
from Waxaharchie.

197
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:54,975
His cousin John.
A missionary on his way to China.

198
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,772
So Charlie probably runs the town?

199
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,101
What do you care?

200
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:10,273
I'm going to spend some time here.

201
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,331
I just like to know who winds the clock.

202
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,499
It's been a nice conversation.

203
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,147
I hate to have it end.

204
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:27,948
Who is this?

205
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:31,888
- Mick, this is my cousin John.
- From Waxahatchie.

206
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:34,459
Cousin John is a missionary
on his way to China.

207
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:36,216
What's keeping him?

208
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:39,105
I think he's wondering if he
couldn't do more good here.

209
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,899
You ain't too friendly, are you?

210
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,097
I like to pick my friends.

211
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:48,330
You ought to learn not to pick them
so easy like you do your cousins.

212
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:49,500
Ask her.

213
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,689
I never saw him before in my life.

214
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,987
You're too little to
make that big a mistake.

215
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:09,501
You gonna correct me or
just bleed at the mouth?

216
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:11,420
Bring him outside.

217
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:22,387
- What happened?
- I wanted to be my cousin.

218
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:25,148
And she hasn't any aunts or uncles.

219
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:35,657
Good boy, Mick.

220
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,239
Look out!

221
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:50,519
Kill him, Mick.

222
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,971
- Mick will kill him.
- That's ten to one.

223
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:58,515
Always bet on the champion.
Then you can only lose once.

224
00:16:58,516 --> 00:17:00,497
Ten to one? I'll take it.

225
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,071
You're down. A thousand to a hundred.

226
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,609
Come on, Mick!

227
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:04,764
Way to go!

228
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,095
Come on, Mick!

229
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:10,343
That is, Mick!

230
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:51,673
It's the first time Mick ever got it.

231
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:53,898
You done a fine job, stranger.

232
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:56,612
I can't believe this.

233
00:18:57,187 --> 00:19:00,054
Mick Marian losing a fight
and me winning a thousand.

234
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:01,982
Give it to him, Prince.

235
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:05,332
In chips.

236
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,573
Care for some coffee?

237
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:37,999
Yeah. Thanks.

238
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:41,151
They told me who was fighting.
I was getting ready to rent you a room.

239
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:44,577
- Sugar or cream?
- Cream.

240
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,856
Myself I'd rather buy a forest fire.

241
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,313
So would I.

242
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,043
When a fights a man

243
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:07,697
because of a woman

244
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,921
it means that the woman

245
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:16,178
has made the man bold.

246
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:19,353
But fighting is no good.

247
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:23,494
Because it just lead to trouble.

248
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:26,754
And a man can't grow old

249
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:31,042
where there's women and gold.

250
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,258
No, a man can't grow old

251
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,906
where there's women and gold.

252
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,420
Come in.

253
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:11,738
How do you feel?

254
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:13,677
Like a million dollars.

255
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,165
You just cost me a thousand.

256
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,614
I brought your hat and coat.

257
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,566
Are you always this sweet
to the men who fight over you?

258
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,042
Only the winners.

259
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:58,498
- Tell me something.
- What?

260
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,816
That fella could have killed me.

261
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:03,909
Where do you bury the losers?

262
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,568
You talk too much.

263
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,572
What do you want? The next dance?

264
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:15,029
I think you better sit this one out.

265
00:22:44,286 --> 00:22:46,898
- Have some coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

266
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,375
The way you run this place, I knew
you must be good at something else.

267
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,611
Some folks call me the town poet.
Others, village idiot.

268
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:55,006
Who am I to question either?

269
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:56,438
How do you feel today?

270
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:58,491
Like I crawled from Kansas City.

271
00:22:58,604 --> 00:23:00,158
Figures to make you pretty famous.

272
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,083
A lot of folks have been
asking for you already.

273
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:05,296
- Who?
- That gold mine lady, Mrs. Caslon.

274
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,370
- That's nice.
- Couldn't do better.

275
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:08,684
And Charlie.

276
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:10,588
- Charlie?
- No less.

277
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:13,157
You seem impressed.

278
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:15,178
Why not?
Charlie owns a piece of everything.

279
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,240
Including the undertaker
and the sheriff.

280
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,526
Stage line too?

281
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,927
Everything but the windy Bible class.

282
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,530
Even owns a piece of me.

283
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,774
Gets your money while you're here
and makes you pay for leave.

284
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:29,685
Well, when you get next verse
of that song, I'd like to hear it.

285
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,913
I can't find a word to rhyme
with "Mick Marion."

286
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,887
- Try "carrion".
- Sure, yeah. Carrion.

287
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,416
Doesn't he ever stopping playing?

288
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,993
Sam? It don't bother him. He's deaf.

289
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,220
Where do I find the boss?

290
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,576
First door. Top of the stairs.

291
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,320
Mick been around?

292
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:06,949
He's indisposed.

293
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,000
Come in.

294
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:34,766
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

295
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,646
- They said Charlie?
- Yes.

296
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:40,204
You're Charlie?

297
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:41,893
Right.

298
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,604
This is Prince.
Don't ever gamble with him.

299
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,412
You mean with his equipment?

300
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,856
She means either.

301
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,975
See you later, Charlie.

302
00:24:52,069 --> 00:24:54,900
You surround yourself
with very affable character.

303
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,742
It makes me feel at home.

304
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:58,384
No. You're not that sinister.

305
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,238
Last night you were
Florence Nightingale in silk stockings.

306
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:02,715
Ouch!

307
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,591
Tell me something.

308
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,756
Why did you start that fight?

309
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:12,023
- I thought you did.
- Oh, really?

310
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,876
You could have insisted
I was your cousin.

311
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:16,905
Maybe that's not the
way I felt about you.

312
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,273
Why did you get the name of Charlie?

313
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:22,345
It was my father's.

314
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,639
My name is Charlene.

315
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,373
Charlene? I like that better.

316
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,280
This will be the first time
I ever worked for a woman.

317
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:32,743
What makes you think
you're going to work for me?

318
00:25:32,744 --> 00:25:33,975
You sent for me.

319
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,023
All right. I sent for you.

320
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,272
I was doing
a nice quiet little business.

321
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,677
Because everybody was afraid of Mick.

322
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,726
Now every time a man has enough
drinks in him to feel rugged,

323
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:46,846
he'll try to do what you did.

324
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:49,235
- Oh, I wouldn't.
- They will.

325
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:52,104
It's not the kind of job I want anyway.

326
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:54,204
I don't intend to start at the bottom.

327
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,240
Been there. It's too crowded.

328
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:57,852
Where do you want to start?

329
00:25:57,853 --> 00:25:59,194
Where the money is.

330
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:02,476
What would you do for it?

331
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,308
Anything. Except hang.

332
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:08,185
- How's this?
- Beautiful.

333
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,766
Where'd you get all this?

334
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:17,327
From my father.

335
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:19,721
He taught me one thing.

336
00:26:20,265 --> 00:26:22,341
A lot of men think they
can beat the tables.

337
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:24,368
All you have to do is get a table.

338
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:29,799
Sometimes they run out of cash and I
find myself with new responsibilities.

339
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:32,671
- Such as?
- A couple of stores.

340
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,932
Naw.
I can't see myself behind a counter.

341
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:37,346
A sawmill and the logging camp.

342
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,792
The logging camp is a
long way from town.

343
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:42,752
Oh. No.

344
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:47,167
I own the stage line from here
to West Rim City but that's a dud.

345
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,613
- Why?
- Outlaws.

346
00:26:50,323 --> 00:26:52,944
Money went in gold shipments.
Now the mines won't ship it.

347
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:54,897
I'll take that job.

348
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:56,761
You mean ride shotgun?

349
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,256
Let me run the line.

350
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:00,458
What do you expect
to get out of that?

351
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,643
A commission on
all the gold I get through.

352
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:04,825
We should buy you a small beer.

353
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:06,199
Glad to get it.

354
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:07,553
It's pretty dangerous.

355
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:10,945
Even Wells Fargo locked up
that station and quit trying.

356
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:13,124
Give me a letter of authorization.

357
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:17,363
I can't bet against you twice, can I?

358
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,147
- Who steals the gold?
- Who doesn't?

359
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:33,258
All they have to do is put on a mask
and they all look like Black Bart.

360
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,442
I forgot to ask you one thing.

361
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:41,015
I'm working for you now.
You can ask me anything.

362
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,055
How do I know I can trust you?

363
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:44,491
You don't.

364
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:46,107
I can?

365
00:27:49,642 --> 00:27:50,832
Only with money.

366
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:55,433
Okay, boss?

367
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:01,215
What's your business with me?

368
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,433
I'm the new manager.

369
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:10,686
Hey, wait a minute. You're not fired.

370
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:13,653
I gotta be. There ain't work enough
here for one man, let alone two..

371
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:15,556
Two can loaf as easy as one.

372
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:19,963
Whitey!

373
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:23,723
This is the new boss, just took over.

374
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:25,964
Whitey here runs the freight
up to the sawmill.

375
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,329
This is Jim Goddard,
the regular stage driver.

376
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:31,645
- Hello, fellas. I don't need the keys.
- Oh.

377
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:34,767
I saw that fight last night.
It was sure a beauty.

378
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:37,598
Let's not talk about that.
Right now, it hurts my hand to listen.

379
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,324
I'm supposed to leave here
for the sawmill before daybreak.

380
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,724
Is that all right, Mr. Haven?

381
00:28:41,725 --> 00:28:44,129
- Yeah, I guess that's all right.
- Thank you, sir.

382
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:45,756
What happened to you?

383
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,922
On my last run, I stopped a bullet.

384
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,647
- Get a good look at them?
- I wish I had.

385
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:52,517
The only thing here that work.

386
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:56,419
Son, I wasted my time here.
I might as well waste some advice.

387
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:58,437
You're full of blood and vinegar.

388
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,393
But this whole thing has got
something wrong with it.

389
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:04,311
Goddard only got a nick in the knee.

390
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:06,264
You may not be so lucky.

391
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,507
I might depend on something
besides luck.

392
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:09,917
Like what?

393
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:11,845
On the fact, they don't
pay to shoot so straight.

394
00:29:12,008 --> 00:29:13,953
They don't need to when
they shoot so often.

395
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:15,510
Worry it over.

396
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,968
I think I'm gonna need you.
But not on one leg.

397
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:21,573
Take it easy.

398
00:29:22,592 --> 00:29:23,631
Yes, sir.

399
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:29,678
- What's all this?
- Something, ain't it?

400
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:31,441
Yeah. Who's is it?

401
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:32,919
Miss Charlie's, Mr. Haven.

402
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,051
Where do you drive her?

403
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:37,127
Same places.
Around the hills, down the river.

404
00:29:37,293 --> 00:29:39,077
- Every afternoon.
- Yes?

405
00:29:39,728 --> 00:29:41,666
I think I'll give you the afternoon off.

406
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,935
I shouldn't let you do this, sir.

407
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,452
But I am.

408
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,595
Miss Charlie may not like this.

409
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:49,799
I will.

410
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:06,250
Does this Haven move me out?
Is that the play?

411
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,667
Prince, you know I
wouldn't part with you.

412
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:10,269
I always come up empty.

413
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:11,739
Not quite.

414
00:30:12,017 --> 00:30:12,895
No.

415
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:16,825
What's the matter, Prince?

416
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,744
I do not like Haven
or anything about him.

417
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:21,022
You said that before.

418
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:23,155
What do you know about him?

419
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,256
What do you want me to do?

420
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,858
Have him looked up in
the Social Registry?

421
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,913
The man walked in out of nowhere.

422
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,070
And went against your table.

423
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:36,854
- Did he play like a gambler?
- He knew something.

424
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,232
Yes and he took Mick down.

425
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:39,656
So he knows how to fight.

426
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,639
You like that part, don't you?

427
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,488
I'll tell you one thing, Prince.
I don't like this part.

428
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:53,244
You know, Prince,
I always find you in good company.

429
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,095
Stand there a second.

430
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,439
Every time I see you,
you look different.

431
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,329
But you always look beautiful.
Why is that?

432
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,609
I always have someone to lie to me.

433
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,999
You can take my hand
if you won't squeeze it.

434
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:13,136
Now tell me what are you
doing with my buggy?

435
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,493
It's my work.
I'm the new transportation boss.

436
00:31:15,494 --> 00:31:16,685
You hired me.

437
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:24,517
Where to?

438
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:26,290
I'm going to call on a gentleman.

439
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:27,889
At this hour?

440
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:29,963
His name is Mark Bristow.

441
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,198
At any hour, it'll be strictly business.

442
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:35,536
The way you say it,
you may need a lawyer.

443
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:38,359
He's a lawyer himself
but it won't help him.

444
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,280
No?

445
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:41,827
What good is a lawyer
if he never gets into court?

446
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:44,449
Oh? Like a doctor in a graveyard.

447
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:46,206
Where is this unlucky man?

448
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:47,508
Across the street.

449
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,659
Whoa, boys!

450
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,181
Think I should take the horses
back and give them a rubdown?

451
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,887
Think they've gone far enough?

452
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:11,224
I haven't.

453
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,463
Maybe you better wait
and come in with me.

454
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,865
- Hello, Mrs. Caslon.
- How do you do?

455
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,498
I wonder if you could do me a favor?

456
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:21,791
Why surely.

457
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:26,946
It's a big favor.

458
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:29,043
I wouldn't blame you if you refused.

459
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,373
What is it?

460
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:33,032
I want to run some gold from your mine.

461
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,199
That is a big favor.

462
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:37,505
I know it seems impossible to you.

463
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:39,377
But that's one reason I'm here.

464
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:41,404
To find out what makes that impossible.

465
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,097
Isn't that very risky?

466
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,593
That's why I couldn't
go to anyone but you.

467
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,817
I'm just wondering if we shouldn't
speak to Captain Iles first?

468
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:53,730
You know what he would say.
I'd advise against it.

469
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:54,980
I suppose so.

470
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:57,550
But if it works my way, it
might clear everything up.

471
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:00,520
For everybody. And for Iles too.

472
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,844
The War Dept does not like
all that gold around an army post.

473
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,666
- Well, I...
- We're working too much in the dark.

474
00:33:07,974 --> 00:33:10,010
This may be the only way
to see something.

475
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,748
Who else will know this?

476
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:13,446
Just us. That's all.

477
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:15,333
And that's the idea.

478
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,819
I'll arrange it.

479
00:33:17,894 --> 00:33:18,777
Good.

480
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:23,287
Don't look so grim.
It's only your gold and my skin.

481
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:25,258
And smile when you walk away.

482
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:27,788
As though we'd been talking
about what a dry summer it's been.

483
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,432
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

484
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:33,061
Charlie, you know how I've always
cooperated as much as possible.

485
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:34,234
But I haven't the money.

486
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,046
These are all your notes for gambling.

487
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:37,858
You're out $6,000.

488
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:39,514
You want to count them?

489
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:42,514
No.

490
00:33:42,764 --> 00:33:44,211
Your credit is over, Mark.

491
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,225
My luck can change, can't it?

492
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:47,594
Not in my tables.

493
00:33:48,575 --> 00:33:51,810
I have seen others fall into the trap.
But I didn't think it would get me.

494
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:52,954
Nobody does.

495
00:33:53,377 --> 00:33:55,458
I'll have Prince come in
and look over your books.

496
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:56,580
Maybe we can work something out.

497
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:58,332
- But...
- That's the way it is, Mark.

498
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:00,771
I pay off on the line.

499
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:02,540
And I expect to get paid.

500
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,849
Oh. What brings you here?

501
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:32,321
Oh I had a dream you'd
be back here tonight.

502
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,164
Why?

503
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:35,410
Maybe because took the keys.

504
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:37,832
Don't they go with the job?

505
00:34:38,148 --> 00:34:40,130
You know how it is with a dream.

506
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:43,036
I got the crazy idea you
were gonna try something.

507
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:46,518
- Like what?
- Well like maybe running a shipment.

508
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:49,467
And then what happened?

509
00:34:49,468 --> 00:34:51,091
I wanted to be some help with it.

510
00:34:51,392 --> 00:34:52,957
All right. You've been some help.

511
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:55,517
Now go on back to sleep.
And I'll finish the dream for you.

512
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:56,810
I'm riding with you, Haven.

513
00:34:57,253 --> 00:34:58,608
I'm riding shotgun.

514
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:01,715
You got more more than
your leg hurt, didn't you?

515
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:04,900
Maybe I just like to ride in the
moonlight if nothing happens.

516
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,058
And if it does?

517
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:09,123
Then I figure I've got a better right
to be there than you have.

518
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,846
All right. Get up there.
We'll go out the back way.

519
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:51,572
Hold it there.

520
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:56,108
Hold those horses!

521
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,582
Ho.

522
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,673
Keep your hands away from your guns.

523
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,611
Get down from there and stand aside.

524
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,734
All right, you. Get down.

525
00:37:14,975 --> 00:37:17,289
Bring up the pace horse. Hurry it up.

526
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,330
Get over there.

527
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:27,597
Bring it up here.

528
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,397
Keep em up.

529
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:40,222
Take it easy.
They hang you just the same.

530
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:43,184
All right, Goddard. Get moving.

531
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:44,991
Go on!

532
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:51,556
Keep em up.

533
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:55,575
That's far enough.

534
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:57,297
Turn around.

535
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:01,102
This certifies that the
bearer, James Goddard,

536
00:39:01,103 --> 00:39:05,049
is operating as a legally deputized...
detective...

537
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:08,078
for Wells Fargo stage
and express company.

538
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:19,677
Get out!

539
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:52,258
Where's Joe?

540
00:42:53,385 --> 00:42:54,694
Something's gone wrong, Pete.

541
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:55,785
Yeah.

542
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,528
I know one thing.

543
00:42:57,721 --> 00:43:00,571
He was born on a horse.
And he didn't just fall off this one.

544
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:01,899
Go look for him.

545
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,841
- Hello, Whitey.
- Hello, Mr. Haven.

546
00:43:43,899 --> 00:43:44,962
What are you hauling?

547
00:43:45,244 --> 00:43:46,985
This is a load of grub for the sawmill.

548
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:49,983
How'd you like to ride
my horse back to town?

549
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:51,533
What about the wagon here?

550
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:53,018
I'll finish the haul.

551
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:55,706
You're the boss.

552
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,169
Anything exciting happen in town?

553
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,575
I don't know, Mr. Haven.
I left town before daybreak.

554
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:05,969
Take it easy with Amber. He's tired.

555
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:07,455
I'll give him good rub then.

556
00:44:45,898 --> 00:44:47,012
Hey you!

557
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:49,393
Did you see if a rider coming up?

558
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:50,246
No.

559
00:44:50,419 --> 00:44:51,406
You sure?

560
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:53,086
I haven't even seen a lizard.

561
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:54,506
Where can I put this stuff?

562
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:56,039
Where did you put it before?

563
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:58,190
I didn't. I'm a new driver.
I think it's grub.

564
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:00,762
Take them over to the cook shack.

565
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,612
Ho! Hey, you the cook?

566
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:17,521
No, I just wear this hat
to keep the flies off my hair.

567
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:20,009
It don't matter to me, brother.
I only haul this grub.

568
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,874
I'd just as soon haul it back to town.

569
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:24,882
Well, take it around the corner.

570
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:58,041
Well. Any luck?

571
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,624
No sign of Joe. But there's tracks
of another horse circling the mill.

572
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:02,104
That's bad.

573
00:46:03,354 --> 00:46:05,809
Let's go take a look
at that new driver again.

574
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:21,227
Hey, driver!

575
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:27,910
You, come here.

576
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,113
You sure you didn't see no rider?

577
00:46:34,074 --> 00:46:36,509
Look. You want me to say
I saw a rider, I'll say it.

578
00:46:36,675 --> 00:46:38,930
I'll say I saw a ghost.
It doesn't make any difference to me.

579
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:40,631
When did you get this job?

580
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:41,715
Yesterday.

581
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:42,790
What for?

582
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,708
It's the system.
If I don't work, I don't eat.

583
00:46:44,876 --> 00:46:46,301
I never found any way to beat it.

584
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:47,531
Who hired you?

585
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:50,163
Look. I'm working. I high
haul this stuff out here.

586
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:51,824
Nobody tells me where to dump it.

587
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:55,118
Everybody wants to know where I've been
and what I haven't seen. I don't know!

588
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:58,246
I get 30 cents an hour. How smart
does that have to make me?

589
00:46:58,385 --> 00:46:59,476
Forget it.

590
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:01,756
I got a load for you to take
in when you're finished here.

591
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:03,535
- Sure.
- How soon?

592
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,846
I haven't eaten anything but dust
since daylight.

593
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,014
All right. Grab it quick.

594
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:14,598
What do you think?

595
00:47:14,974 --> 00:47:16,631
We risk him. That's all.

596
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,285
Here. Work on this stuff.

597
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,853
How about a handout?

598
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,120
Help yourself.

599
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,347
Looks pretty good.

600
00:47:33,945 --> 00:47:35,022
It oughta be.

601
00:47:35,023 --> 00:47:36,793
Used to cook for 600 men a day.

602
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:38,151
Where was that?

603
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:39,669
Leavenworth.

604
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:43,725
Who's the boss around here?

605
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:44,858
I am.

606
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,811
I mean the whole works.

607
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,168
You talked to the
man when you came in.

608
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:51,028
That real tough-looking fella?

609
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:53,778
They're all tough when
they get to Mick Marion.

610
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:55,910
Mick come around here very often?

611
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:57,201
Last night.

612
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,870
It looked like somebody got to him.

613
00:47:59,445 --> 00:48:00,417
How's that?

614
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:01,971
His face all beat up.

615
00:48:02,678 --> 00:48:03,911
Like your knuckles.

616
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,467
No. I had bad luck
with a crate of cauliflower.

617
00:48:07,629 --> 00:48:08,940
That's what he brought up here.

618
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:11,249
A cauliflower face.

619
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,737
Do you fight him?

620
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,127
Mick?

621
00:48:15,629 --> 00:48:16,977
Do I look like I would?

622
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:19,468
Just the knuckles.

623
00:48:23,451 --> 00:48:25,012
Say you, driver, hurry up.

624
00:48:25,348 --> 00:48:26,515
I'll be right out.

625
00:48:29,029 --> 00:48:30,850
Not many hands here, are they?

626
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:32,369
All up at the logging camp.

627
00:48:33,669 --> 00:48:36,077
Well, hi-dee-ho.

628
00:48:37,669 --> 00:48:39,660
Much obliged.
This was real fine Mulligan.

629
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:41,717
I make it better with cauliflower.

630
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:48,515
It is good, isn't it?

631
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:52,126
Maybe this ain't such a good idea.

632
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:55,664
You, come over here.

633
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:01,387
- Do you see this box?
- Yeah.

634
00:49:01,469 --> 00:49:03,663
It goes to Prince.
You know who Prince is?

635
00:49:03,828 --> 00:49:06,103
- No.
- He runs things for Charlie.

636
00:49:06,268 --> 00:49:08,703
- Do you know who Charlie is?
- Sure.

637
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:09,988
All right. Get up there.

638
00:49:12,388 --> 00:49:13,612
Oh, one thing.

639
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:17,447
The gearbox you're hauling
in has got to be repaired.

640
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:21,019
You tell Charlie if it ain't repaired,
we might have to shut down quick.

641
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,727
- You got that?
- I got it.

642
00:49:22,915 --> 00:49:24,813
All right. Then get out of here.

643
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:51,289
Draw the blinds, Bristow.

644
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:12,384
Light it up.

645
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:25,295
Can't you put that gun away?

646
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:27,338
I can but it helps to quiet my nerves.

647
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:29,336
- A drink?
- No.

648
00:51:29,906 --> 00:51:31,910
We had given you up for dead.

649
00:51:31,986 --> 00:51:33,658
- Who?
- Who?

650
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:35,927
Why... everybody.

651
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:40,576
They found Goddard's body.
Didn't you know?

652
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,040
What happened?

653
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:43,857
Sit down.

654
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:47,814
If you're trying to imply that
you frightened me coming here,

655
00:51:48,389 --> 00:51:49,608
you're quite right.

656
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:52,040
I am neither a hero nor a fool.

657
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,290
They killed Goddard.
Why didn't they kill you?

658
00:51:55,515 --> 00:51:57,309
Someone wanted me alive.

659
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,449
What for?

660
00:51:58,834 --> 00:51:59,803
I don't know.

661
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:01,575
What do you want from me?

662
00:52:02,273 --> 00:52:04,847
I'm gonna make a statement that
you will write and notarize.

663
00:52:05,274 --> 00:52:06,293
Is that all?

664
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:07,630
Yeah.

665
00:52:10,553 --> 00:52:13,784
You'll put it away where it can't
be stolen or tampered with.

666
00:52:13,954 --> 00:52:15,550
- I have a safe.
- I can see that.

667
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:17,748
Meaning you don't trust me?

668
00:52:17,754 --> 00:52:20,871
I do.
I just don't think you trust yourself.

669
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,734
Where do you want it put?

670
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:25,257
Mrs. Caslon has a safe. A nice fat one.

671
00:52:26,153 --> 00:52:27,389
I think I can arrange it.

672
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:28,513
All right.

673
00:52:29,154 --> 00:52:30,275
Here's the statement.

674
00:52:32,474 --> 00:52:33,794
I solemnly swear,

675
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:38,120
that on Thursday last, about 11 pm,

676
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:41,763
the stagecoach I was driving

677
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:46,362
was held up by five armed bandits.

678
00:52:48,033 --> 00:52:51,835
The gold I was hauling was stolen,

679
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:56,107
and Jim Goddard, the guard,

680
00:52:57,473 --> 00:52:59,474
was murdered in cold blood.

681
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:04,618
Are you sure it was Haven you met?

682
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:06,578
I know my own boss.

683
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,310
Go in and get a beer.

684
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:11,236
Haven's wagon's across the street.

685
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:13,123
He must be back in town.

686
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:16,643
Now I'm wondering what
I get out of this?

687
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:19,716
Charlie is holding $6,000 of your IOU's.

688
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:21,121
You're busted.

689
00:53:21,408 --> 00:53:22,865
This will get you even.

690
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:29,781
And now you wonder why we
just don't take all that gold

691
00:53:29,782 --> 00:53:33,332
and go around the world.
Monte Carlo, the Taj Mahal...

692
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:35,714
I've a better idea for you.

693
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:38,978
Find the gold yourself.
Plant the deposition.

694
00:53:38,979 --> 00:53:40,400
And let me hang for it.

695
00:53:40,743 --> 00:53:43,281
Then you'd be rich. And you
won't even need to travel.

696
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:46,251
That might take some doing.

697
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:47,811
And some nerve.

698
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:51,417
- Where do I sign?
- Here.

699
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,009
Don't get so excited.

700
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,836
I'm perfectly calm.
And I'm asking you calmly

701
00:53:55,837 --> 00:53:59,660
How could you allow that scoundrel to
transport gold from your mine when you

702
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:01,830
The man you call a scoundrel
may be dead at this moment.

703
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:03,993
He may be in town at this moment,
where in fact he is.

704
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:05,731
How could you do such a
thing without telling me?

705
00:54:05,763 --> 00:54:07,198
I only did it for your sake.

706
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:09,489
- My sake?
- He represents the US government.

707
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,389
- And who do I represent?
- I was only...

708
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:14,666
And while we're on the subject,
what was Mark Bristow doing here?

709
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:18,106
Mark Bristow is my lawyer
and you know it.

710
00:54:18,107 --> 00:54:19,307
I'm sorry.

711
00:54:19,308 --> 00:54:20,846
I wish you could see that some times

712
00:54:20,847 --> 00:54:23,382
you're a little too sure
about too many things.

713
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,200
One nice thing about us is
we are always wrong together.

714
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:32,161
Mark gave me this.
That's why I was here.

715
00:54:33,491 --> 00:54:35,001
You're not going to open it?

716
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,246
"To whom it may concern."

717
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:39,431
It may concern me.

718
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:45,841
It does.

719
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,762
Your friend, Mr. Haven,
still has your gold.

720
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,715
Those nitwits in Washington.

721
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:54,495
Sending a demoted lieutenant out here

722
00:54:54,621 --> 00:54:56,689
to poke around in my business.

723
00:54:57,491 --> 00:54:59,527
You're getting to be a
hard man to deal with.

724
00:54:59,691 --> 00:55:01,920
I'm getting to deal with some hard men.

725
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,487
I'll take care of that.

726
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:50,339
It looks like a board meeting.

727
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,641
What's he doing with you?

728
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,292
I might I might need a lawyer.

729
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:54,688
I doubt it.

730
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:58,824
I realize how seldom
legal technicalities annoy you.

731
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:01,218
- But I think I have one that might.
- What's that?

732
00:56:01,383 --> 00:56:02,460
Just a story.

733
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,656
About a man who are murdered.

734
00:56:04,783 --> 00:56:06,007
A thief who got shot.

735
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:08,357
And a gearbox I failed to deliver.

736
00:56:11,624 --> 00:56:13,349
Probably no one would believe it

737
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:15,355
unless I had killed for it.

738
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:18,779
- Who else have you told?
- Only Mark.

739
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:21,496
He is a lawyer and a notary.
He makes it stick.

740
00:56:21,862 --> 00:56:23,174
He finally gets to court.

741
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:25,458
I don't know anything. I
merely wrote the deposition.

742
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:26,455
You shut up.

743
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,220
Since you brought your lawyer,

744
00:56:28,423 --> 00:56:30,547
ask him if this doesn't
sound like blackmail.

745
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:34,297
He can't think very clearly
in the presence of a gun.

746
00:56:34,298 --> 00:56:35,550
But it doesn't bother you?

747
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:36,738
No. It doesn't.

748
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,637
Pete, go downstairs
and watch the stairway.

749
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:49,035
What you want is a cut.

750
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,273
That's right.

751
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,427
It boils down to this.

752
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:55,682
We can make a deal
and all be very happy together.

753
00:56:55,861 --> 00:56:56,873
How could that be?

754
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:58,477
When I deliver the gold to you.

755
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,268
You mean the gearbox?

756
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:02,862
I can even forget I looked inside.

757
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,939
So I stole a gearbox.
I'm still a thief.

758
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:07,921
- What if he gets them?
- He gets even.

759
00:57:07,981 --> 00:57:08,936
Have you lost your mind?

760
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:10,777
It was all right when he lost his money.

761
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,890
All right.

762
00:57:12,905 --> 00:57:16,296
Prince will give him the IOU's
when the gearbox is delivered.

763
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:18,160
I think that's all.

764
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:25,218
Haven, you can stay.

765
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:27,615
You excuse me, Prince?

766
00:57:28,499 --> 00:57:31,810
You know you roll nice dice.
You bet em jam up too.

767
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,350
But one day you're gonna slip.

768
00:57:33,494 --> 00:57:35,448
When you do, I'll be
around to catch you.

769
00:57:40,494 --> 00:57:41,975
You know I think he will.

770
00:57:42,979 --> 00:57:44,906
You should be more careful.

771
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:47,384
I suppose so.

772
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:50,457
I won't have to have you killed.

773
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,798
I'd have had you hated it.

774
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:54,411
So would I.

775
00:57:55,312 --> 00:57:57,152
I'd have missed you too much.

776
00:57:57,271 --> 00:57:58,373
And too long.

777
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:03,088
Did you ever tell a
woman you loved her?

778
00:58:03,419 --> 00:58:04,558
All of them.

779
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:06,297
How'd you get away?

780
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:09,832
I was always in the doorway
when I said it.

781
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:12,933
You never said it to me.

782
00:58:15,473 --> 00:58:16,826
Let's get over to the doorway.

783
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:31,896
Don't move. Turn around.

784
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:39,238
Put ​​the gold in the wagon.

785
00:58:40,155 --> 00:58:41,105
Is this a holdup?

786
00:58:41,469 --> 00:58:42,915
You want to put it in the wagon?

787
00:58:52,476 --> 00:58:54,414
Now was there something
you wanted to say?

788
00:58:54,646 --> 00:58:55,649
Yeah.

789
00:58:57,466 --> 00:58:59,629
I followed one of the bandits
here when he cached it.

790
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:02,466
I couldn't haul it on a horse
so I came back with a wagon.

791
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:04,071
I know that's a lie.

792
00:59:04,716 --> 00:59:05,795
Some of it's true.

793
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,285
But not nearly enough.

794
00:59:08,235 --> 00:59:10,297
All right. I'll try it again.

795
00:59:11,316 --> 00:59:13,985
I cached it there myself.
I was going to give it to them.

796
00:59:14,154 --> 00:59:15,714
I wanted to buy
membership in their club.

797
00:59:15,715 --> 00:59:17,024
That was the initiation fee.

798
00:59:17,108 --> 00:59:18,344
$50,000?

799
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:21,145
You see I thought it was worth it.

800
00:59:21,747 --> 00:59:23,212
Well, you see I don't.

801
00:59:24,388 --> 00:59:27,698
What you're doing may
get me in trouble.

802
00:59:28,427 --> 00:59:32,943
If you're still in town in 24 hours,
I promise you will be in trouble.

803
00:59:33,467 --> 00:59:34,816
Now start walking.

804
00:59:36,628 --> 00:59:37,550
Go on.

805
00:59:58,467 --> 00:59:59,815
I thought you were in jail?

806
00:59:59,816 --> 01:00:01,345
I talked my way out.

807
01:00:01,493 --> 01:00:02,888
You are a very glib man.

808
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:04,304
Can you talk your way
out of everything?

809
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,409
- Up to a certain point.
- What's that?

810
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:08,687
The gun. Some champagne, waiter.

811
01:00:09,746 --> 01:00:11,500
Are we celebrating something?

812
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:15,738
The first time I talked
to you, we had champagne.

813
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:18,288
Didn't you bring me something?

814
01:00:18,707 --> 01:00:20,576
- No.
- But you will?

815
01:00:20,906 --> 01:00:24,192
- No.
- "No." Just like that?

816
01:00:25,507 --> 01:00:28,481
I went to get it. It was there but...

817
01:00:29,357 --> 01:00:30,427
so was somebody else.

818
01:00:30,665 --> 01:00:31,492
Who?

819
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:32,814
Mrs. Caslon.

820
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:34,113
Alone?

821
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:35,785
No, she had a gun with her.

822
01:00:35,947 --> 01:00:37,300
Didn't you have one too?

823
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,498
The one she had was in her hand.

824
01:00:43,426 --> 01:00:47,180
You know this could be
that slip you mentioned.

825
01:00:47,586 --> 01:00:50,563
So this nice lady held you up
and took the gold. Is that it?

826
01:00:51,866 --> 01:00:54,134
It's like saying I was
robbed at Sunday School.

827
01:00:54,906 --> 01:00:56,090
No good, is it?

828
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:57,550
No.

829
01:00:58,546 --> 01:01:00,465
Mick might've killed you.
But you fought him anyway.

830
01:01:00,466 --> 01:01:02,553
Pete last night had a gun
but that didn't scare you.

831
01:01:02,554 --> 01:01:05,563
And now this gentile petticoat waves
a gun and you run for your life.

832
01:01:06,546 --> 01:01:07,898
You make it sound very silly.

833
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:09,136
Or make it sound like what it is.

834
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,255
A lie.

835
01:01:13,513 --> 01:01:15,791
My word doesn't seem to be
very good around here.

836
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:18,393
You've only got one thing that's
very good around here.

837
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:19,874
Some gold.

838
01:01:21,718 --> 01:01:23,754
- Is that all I've got?
- Not quite.

839
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:27,029
You got some time.
You got two hours to get it here.

840
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:31,638
And you want me to fatten you up
before you have me killed.

841
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:34,354
- Is that what you mean?
- I said what I meant. Two hours.

842
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:53,563
You're sweet.

843
01:02:40,558 --> 01:02:42,310
- Well?
- Everything's all set.

844
01:02:42,477 --> 01:02:44,547
- Got enough men at the sawmill?
- Yeah, plenty.

845
01:02:44,712 --> 01:02:46,457
Get back out there.
Get them into uniforms.

846
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,224
We hit the post just before dawn.

847
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,228
I don't know what we've waiting for?

848
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,534
I gave him some time.

849
01:02:55,777 --> 01:02:57,282
He's in the hotel.
He's not doing anything.

850
01:02:57,283 --> 01:02:58,501
I got him some time!

851
01:02:59,051 --> 01:03:01,247
I don't care what he does with it.

852
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,713
- You want your IOU's?
- You mean...

853
01:03:24,372 --> 01:03:26,521
- Why? Did Haven...?
- No, he didn't.

854
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:28,533
I don't understand.

855
01:03:28,534 --> 01:03:30,658
We don't think they're
going to be any good.

856
01:03:33,532 --> 01:03:35,204
I haven't anything to do with it.

857
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:38,222
- I can still make the good or...
- What?

858
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:40,935
I can still do business.

859
01:03:41,754 --> 01:03:43,424
Here. Take a look at this.

860
01:03:43,724 --> 01:03:45,469
The deposition. The only copy.

861
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:48,594
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

862
01:03:48,775 --> 01:03:50,435
All I want to do is get out of it.

863
01:03:50,436 --> 01:03:51,577
I never had any part of it.

864
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,265
- This oughta prove it.
- This?

865
01:03:57,655 --> 01:03:59,083
It's a trick.

866
01:04:00,534 --> 01:04:01,912
I'll see about this.

867
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:04,608
Haven can't do this to me.

868
01:04:05,855 --> 01:04:08,189
- I'll go and see this.
- Sure. You see about it.

869
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,429
Here, take this along.

870
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:29,493
Something left to wait for?

871
01:04:39,014 --> 01:04:40,014
No.

872
01:04:51,374 --> 01:04:53,651
- Who is it?
- It's me. Bristow. Let me in.

873
01:05:05,654 --> 01:05:08,213
- Are you going to kill me, Mark?
- You double-crossed me, Haven.

874
01:05:08,374 --> 01:05:10,834
- I did?
- I got the deposition back.

875
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:12,022
I took it to him.

876
01:05:12,023 --> 01:05:14,241
It wasn't there.
It was just a piece of blank paper.

877
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:16,926
Don't you laugh at me or I'll kill you.

878
01:05:17,476 --> 01:05:18,992
Well, they want you to, Mark.

879
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:21,719
And it may be your only out if you do.
But I doubt it.

880
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:23,028
You know why?

881
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:27,457
Because even if you took them my scalp,
it wouldn't buy your life.

882
01:05:27,697 --> 01:05:30,608
You're in debt. You're broke.
And you're scared.

883
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:32,714
And you know far too much.

884
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:36,048
There isn't any way
they can use you alive.

885
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:39,231
Can you think of one?

886
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:48,868
They're going to do it. I know it.

887
01:05:49,407 --> 01:05:50,608
They're gonna kill me.

888
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:52,741
Why do they have to kill me?

889
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:53,994
Us, Mark.

890
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:59,184
- This must be hers.
- Yes.

891
01:06:01,033 --> 01:06:02,158
She's sweet.

892
01:06:03,403 --> 01:06:05,163
One thing, Mark.
You might get out of town.

893
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:07,466
Not a chance in a thousand.

894
01:06:07,473 --> 01:06:10,133
You'll do one in a million if
it's the only one you have.

895
01:06:13,632 --> 01:06:15,696
Yeah, I might get away with it.

896
01:06:16,734 --> 01:06:17,639
I could try it.

897
01:06:17,752 --> 01:06:20,504
If you do, go straight for your horse.
Don't stop for anything.

898
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,960
I have some important
papers in the office.

899
01:06:22,961 --> 01:06:25,414
You haven't anything important
left except your life.

900
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:26,968
And very little time to keep it.

901
01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:30,150
Get on the horse and ride him
until he dies.

902
01:06:30,321 --> 01:06:33,015
Then run until you have to crawl
and you might be lucky.

903
01:06:35,481 --> 01:06:36,405
Yeah.

904
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:38,423
Yeah.

905
01:08:09,013 --> 01:08:13,131
Hey, I'm naturally sentimental,
being sort of a poet.

906
01:08:13,407 --> 01:08:14,403
Naturally.

907
01:08:14,479 --> 01:08:17,994
I keep a bunch of Jim Cracks.
An old-time sheriff's gun.

908
01:08:18,241 --> 01:08:19,977
A bullet from a dead bandit.

909
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:22,327
And a rosary from
some fellow they hung.

910
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:24,541
That's nice. A hobby?

911
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,690
Yeah, in a kind of way.

912
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,623
I just wondered if there was something
that you wanted to leave me.

913
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:39,890
The only thing I have.

914
01:08:46,932 --> 01:08:50,719
An army button. Where's the
uniform that goes with it?

915
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:56,637
I might even know.

916
01:08:57,837 --> 01:08:59,251
I think I'll go find out.

917
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:29,768
Where's your gun?

918
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:31,818
I dropped it back there.

919
01:09:37,062 --> 01:09:38,712
All right, you, march.

920
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:44,547
Is that thing loaded?

921
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,127
You try your tricks and you'll find out.

922
01:09:48,092 --> 01:09:50,401
No tricks, sheriff. No tricks.

923
01:10:39,171 --> 01:10:41,086
Hey, go on back. Mick wants you.

924
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:23,204
What happened to you?

925
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:25,116
Haven slugged me.

926
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:09,276
Haven?

927
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:10,877
Keep him in here.

928
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:29,961
- Captain Iles.
- Don't apologize. Just barge right in.

929
01:13:30,089 --> 01:13:32,869
- I'll tell you something.
- No, you're not. You're gonna listen.

930
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,005
You lost some uniforms.
You thought they were burned.

931
01:13:35,006 --> 01:13:36,858
- They were burned.
- No, they weren't. But now I do.

932
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:38,779
But they are now because
I set fire to them.

933
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:39,492
What?

934
01:13:39,493 --> 01:13:42,491
They are smoldering right now at
the warehouse down at the sawmill

935
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,787
There are 70 men down
there ready to wear them.

936
01:13:44,789 --> 01:13:46,011
Wear them. What for?

937
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:49,576
What other reason except to get in this
army post and take the gold from you?

938
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:53,330
Now you're about to send a detachment
of men up north on an Indian scare?

939
01:13:53,331 --> 01:13:55,461
- Yeah.
- That Indian scare is a fake.

940
01:13:55,462 --> 01:13:56,309
It's a ruse.

941
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:57,969
You know where to send them now.

942
01:14:04,463 --> 01:14:06,613
Guess I owe you an apology.

943
01:14:07,182 --> 01:14:10,124
You better go down to the sawmill.
They might try it anyway.

944
01:14:12,743 --> 01:14:13,769
I...

945
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,894
I guess also owe something too.

946
01:14:17,062 --> 01:14:18,630
Only $50,000.

947
01:14:19,943 --> 01:14:22,661
I wish there were something
I could say or do.

948
01:14:22,822 --> 01:14:25,462
There is. You can give me back my gun.

949
01:14:29,343 --> 01:14:30,700
I could give this one to the sheriff.

950
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:32,943
Tell him to be careful with it.
It's got bullets in it now.

951
01:14:34,182 --> 01:14:36,936
I'll always remember
what a fool I made of myself.

952
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:38,844
I'll always try to forget.

953
01:14:39,262 --> 01:14:40,474
Are you going too?

954
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:42,092
Not with them.

955
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,489
You caused me
an awful amount of trouble.

956
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:49,781
Yeah, but I finally
brought you something.

957
01:15:50,942 --> 01:15:53,243
You didn't think Mark
would use that, did you?

958
01:15:53,622 --> 01:15:55,562
Maybe I just wanted to send you a gun.

959
01:15:56,141 --> 01:15:56,973
Maybe.

960
01:15:57,773 --> 01:15:59,773
I have to arrest you.

961
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,283
- Why?
- Murder.

962
01:16:04,222 --> 01:16:06,766
I could have shot just now and I didn't.

963
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:08,812
I didn't kill the two men or Goddard.

964
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,040
Who did?

965
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:11,528
Maybe Mick.

966
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:14,440
- Maybe Prince. Who knows?
- You know.

967
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:19,619
If you still have the gold, and I
think you do, we might make a gift.

968
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,631
I believe every man has a price.

969
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:24,661
Some men don't believe that.

970
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,261
But woman knows it.

971
01:16:26,518 --> 01:16:28,893
There wouldn't be any women
on my jury.

972
01:16:30,021 --> 01:16:32,419
And why you're not as bad
off as you might think.

973
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:36,178
I could find a dozen men who might
find you capable of almost anything,

974
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:40,386
but I wouldn't bet they'd vote that way
after staring at you through a trial.

975
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:43,533
Mick is dead for the murders.
Prince can hang for the rest of it.

976
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:46,054
Isn't it a little late
to make any difference?

977
01:16:46,055 --> 01:16:47,291
Maybe not.

978
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:48,939
Where is Prince?

979
01:17:10,588 --> 01:17:11,450
It's no good.

980
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:12,844
I'll get someone.

981
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,604
Stay here.

982
01:17:17,453 --> 01:17:18,695
Tell me

983
01:17:21,788 --> 01:17:23,061
on the square.

984
01:17:26,405 --> 01:17:27,593
Did you ever love me?

985
01:17:28,616 --> 01:17:31,824
From the first night,
from the first time of song.

986
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,459
I tried to get away from it.

987
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,690
But every time, it came back.

988
01:17:39,396 --> 01:17:42,174
Every time I tried it out of my brain,

989
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:45,199
I just pushed it deeper into my heart.

990
01:17:46,604 --> 01:17:47,623
Say it.

991
01:17:48,484 --> 01:17:49,703
I love you.

992
01:17:52,724 --> 01:17:54,999
I love you.

993
01:18:00,683 --> 01:18:04,881
See you... in China.

994
01:18:49,885 --> 01:18:53,273
The sun shines warm

995
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:57,756
on the dust of the prairie

996
01:18:57,924 --> 01:19:00,872
The sun shining warm

997
01:19:02,009 --> 01:19:06,400
but it's heartless and cold

998
01:19:06,803 --> 01:19:10,433
it's heartless and cold

999
01:19:10,804 --> 01:19:14,319
in the dust of the prairie

1000
01:19:15,273 --> 01:19:18,709
And a man can't grow old

1001
01:19:19,044 --> 01:19:22,718
where there's women and gold.

1002
01:19:22,871 --> 01:19:25,828
A man can't grow old

1003
01:19:26,484 --> 01:19:30,916
where there's women and gold.
