00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,659
to come down here and conversate
with condemned fugitives.

184
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:01,796
I'm askin' if you hold the law in contempt.

185
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:06,364
The law and me have been
at each other pretty hard

186
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,037
for a long time now.

187
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:12,673
We know each other well.

188
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:23,248
You have certain skills, Mr. Snow.

189
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:26,220
I may have need for those skills.

190
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:29,390
The question is whether you
can put them to use for someone

191
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:31,559
other than yourself.

192
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:35,931
I have never tried.

193
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:38,535
What if it were worth your life?

194
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,004
Do you swear to enforce the law of Wyoming,

195
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,110
its letter and its spirit,

196
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:54,207
without prejudice of persons
in pursuance of your duties?

197
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:56,310
Right, yeah. I do.

198
00:15:56,345 --> 00:16:01,081
Then you're our new marshal.

199
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:03,749
Lots of individuals would be surprised.

200
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,483
Cheyenne's full of men wanted elsewhere.

201
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,884
Bail jumpers, fugitives.

202
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,825
Also indentured freedmen
among the railroad workers,

203
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,393
vagrants.

204
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,760
Durant hasn't paid their bond in years.

205
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,963
That means they're illegal too.

206
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:24,571
I want you to arrest them all.

207
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:28,742
- Gonna need some deputies.
- Take those.

208
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,817
[Laughs] Damn, boys, it's your lucky day.

209
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,759
Travel one inch outside my orders,

210
00:16:40,794 --> 00:16:44,496
I'll tie the noose myself.

211
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,198
Not to worry, governor.

212
00:16:46,232 --> 00:16:47,333
My honor.

213
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,102
[Spits]

214
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:53,140
As a gentleman.

215
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:55,575
You start with those.

216
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,357
Charlotte can cook, wash, keep house.

217
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,659
Does her figures like anything.

218
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:15,458
She can read and write
like nobody's business.

219
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,495
Folks can see she's a respectable person.

220
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,886
We'll get you a change of clothes.

221
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,930
I'll find something for you to do here.

222
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:35,498
Can't even imagine what you've been through.

223
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,234
Thank...

224
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:40,937
It's okay.

225
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:50,677
Thank you.

226
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:54,214
[Crying]

227
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,549
- [Singing indistinctly]
- He's got eyes like his papa.

228
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,987
Don't he have brother
Bohannon's pretty eyes?

229
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,421
[Giggles]

230
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,589
How dare you say that about my husband.

231
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,489
Esther's got her own beau.

232
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,323
Brother Michael Doone.

233
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:10,259
He's got eyes like an old ox sittin'
in the sun.

234
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:12,261
- [Giggles]
- Girls.

235
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:16,193
This is Naomi's first meal home.

236
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,297
She's happy to be among them.

237
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,202
She's missed this.

238
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:24,236
That's a fact.

239
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,772
Well, I can only guess at what's brought you

240
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,474
back from Cheyenne.

241
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:33,579
But is there any good reason
you shouldn't stay on?

242
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,549
Both of you, together.

243
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,817
With us.

244
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,220
I have authority here.

245
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:43,424
I can smooth your way with the congregation.

246
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,595
You will be made welcome.

247
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:55,608
Perhaps Bishop Dutson was right after all.

248
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:58,144
How's that?

249
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,311
Only that everything a
righteous man could ever want

250
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:04,949
is here.

251
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,120
What'd you mean, Dutson's gone? Gone where?

252
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,853
Brigham young.

253
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,619
To Utah.

254
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,488
[Log thuds]

255
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:54,277
Your father wants us to stay on for good.

256
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,011
You still ain't said if
that's what you want.

257
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:10,019
I can't think about goin' back.

258
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,755
Naomi.

259
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,798
We're better off here.

260
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:21,269
Me and William,
and don't say that you don't see that.

261
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:35,236
[Pebble plunks]

262
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,749
You ain't had it easy in Cheyenne.

263
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,886
I know that, all right?

264
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:47,955
I do.

265
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,126
But it ain't always gonna be Cheyenne.

266
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,440
The railroad'll move on, we'll...

267
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:54,694
This isn't about Cheyenne!

268
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:01,401
I washed the blood off of you.

269
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:04,002
Washed the blood off of you of a man

270
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:07,605
that you killed, that you loved.

271
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:10,706
I ain't forgettin' that.

272
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:15,897
That's you.

273
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,495
That's who you are.

274
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:30,121
End of the line, folks!

275
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,358
Cheyenne. End of the line.

276
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:53,487
[Background chatter]

277
00:21:57,326 --> 00:22:00,233
What we got here, old timer?

278
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,935
Y'all go ahead around

279
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,704
the back side of those 
wagons over there, yeah?

280
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,474
Yes, sir. You heard him.

281
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:34,879
Hup!

282
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:38,550
That's it, brother.

283
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,354
Even that out.

284
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:45,327
Hup!

285
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:48,862
Get it on up, brother.

286
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:51,396
Get it in there.

287
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,433
That's it, brother.

288
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:56,269
All you men!

289
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:02,073
It appears some of you
are wanted by the law.

290
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:05,808
Else you're here on bonds
that ain't been paid.

291
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:10,482
I am here to see that y'all
are brought to justice.

292
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,753
Less trouble you give me, easier it'll be.

293
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:16,890
'Course, I don't mind trouble.

294
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:18,959
[Guns cock]

295
00:23:23,432 --> 00:23:25,600
All of these men, all of 'em,

296
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:29,604
are legitimate employees of
the Union Pacific Railroad.

297
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:32,841
Yes, sir. [Men murmuring]

298
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:34,442
Virgil Farnsworth.

299
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:37,276
Wanted in New York.

300
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:40,449
[Men murmuring]

301
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:41,751
It was a bar fight

302
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:43,586
down at the bowery.

303
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,155
Other guy walked away.

304
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:49,323
Don't that count for nothin'?

305
00:23:49,357 --> 00:23:51,257
Hey! [Gun cocks]

306
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,328
[Grunts]

307
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:54,966
Dutch Dufray.

308
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,536
Armed robbery in the city of brotherly love!

309
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:01,973
Anybody gets in our way,
you arrest them too.

310
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,779
Now... who do we have here?

311
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:08,182
Julius Hankey.

312
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,152
Whoo! Look at that boy run.

313
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:14,657
Enoch Buell.

314
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:16,226
Psalms Jackson.

315
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,363
Durant didn't pay my bond.

316
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:23,000
- Why don't you arrest him?
- It might come to that.

317
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:25,802
Move. Come on!

318
00:24:25,837 --> 00:24:27,236
That's it, that's all.

319
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,677
Round up the goodies, gentlemen. Follow me.

00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:51,175
Get outta here! That's right!

[Overlapping shouting]

323
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:57,953
What kind of cra... I never robbed nobody!

324
00:24:57,988 --> 00:24:59,456
Not in Ohio anyways!

325
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,060
I don't care what the poster says!

326
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:02,695
We gonna drag you down to the judge,

327
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,963
and you can talk his ear off.

Is... is-land?

335
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:47,685
- Island.
- Island.

336
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,153
That sits in the sea.

337

They're coming now.

You see I have a child here.

349
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:15,139
You come with a gun to a place of worship?

350

The place I saved your life.

351
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,942
As for a gun,
I've no mind to use it if you help me.

352

I have nowhere to hide you.

Hot damn.

00:26:57,762 --> 00:27:00,899
I got to go to church more often.

359

Can I help you?
