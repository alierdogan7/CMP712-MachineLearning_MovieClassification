1
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,312
Door.

2
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,557
Shut the door, squirrel.

3
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:53,970
Whiskey.

4
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:39,586
How are you?

5
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,447
Bean. Roy Bean.

6
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:46,420
Maybe you heard of me.
My picture's on the wall.

7
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,563
On the other side of that wall over there.

8
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,763
Just...

9
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,406
robbed the Granger's Trust
down in Magdalena.

10
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,637
That's no easy pickings.

11
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,270
Bonanza Stud
had his left hand shot half away...

12
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:06,474
and I picked two pellets
of crude-iron buckshot...

13
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,141
out of my ankle.

14
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:19,357
I always heard that a man on the dodge
is welcome west of the Pecos.

15
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,192
Maybe I heard wrong.

16
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,324
You heard right.

17
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:35,904
"Revised Laws and Statutes
of the State of Texas."

18
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,605
What's that doing here?

19
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,773
For the whores to piss on.

20
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,310
Give him a drink of cactus whiskey.

21
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,999
You a bank robber?

22
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,037
You get much out of that Magdalena one?

23
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:10,469
No.

24
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,507
Enough?

25
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,614
That's right, enough.

26
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,450
Buy me a drink, bank robber?

27
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,928
Listen, when Roy Bean drinks,
everybody drinks.

28
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,173
Give me the money.

29
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,874
Let me get some of that.

30
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:54,920
I want some of that money!

31
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,928
- Get off him.
- Get him strung.

32
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,136
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,443
Here! Tie it!

34
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:20,172
Go.

35
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:05,652
Gun.

36
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:48,085
Come back here, you son of a bitch!

37
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,163
Kill him! Shoot him!

38
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,344
I'm going to get Marvin.

39
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:46,048
Come on back here!
I ain't through killing you!

40
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:49,621
You hear me?
All of your kind, I'll be waiting!

41
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,832
The first time I saw Roy Bean...

42
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:09,294
he was set on killing me.

43
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,433
Thought I was the Devil, come to take him.

44
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:15,600
It was an understandable thought,
considering all the carnage...

45
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:18,306
that he had so recently brought forth.

46
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,353
I'm the Reverend Mr. LaSalle.

47
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:41,469
"Though I walk in the valley
of the shadow...

48
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,833
"I fear not."

49
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,288
What has happened here?

50
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:07,023
These men tried to hang me,
and they have been killed for it.

51
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,257
How many of them are there?

52
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,924
A lot of them.

53
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:17,498
- Who did the killing?
- I did.

54
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:22,008
They were bad men,
and the whores weren't ladies.

55
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:27,841
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."

56
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,811
It was.

57
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,049
I'm waiting for the buzzards.

58
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,416
They don't deserve burying.

59
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,291
Maybe they don't...

60
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:43,995
but they ought to be.

61
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,531
They are a stench and an abomination.

62
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,338
I've got a shovel if you don't.

63
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:21,469
I buried them
because Christ had died for all of them.

64
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,231
It was his choice, not mine.

65
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:27,705
I am not one to question the wisdom
of the Almighty.

66
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,017
Get my Bible.

67
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,553
It is in the saddlebag.

68
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,867
I will read over the dead now.

69
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,769
My Bible, please, Mr...

70
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:05,605
Bean.

71
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,112
- Bean.
- Roy Bean.

72
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,576
Judge Roy Bean.

73
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,355
I am the new law in this area.

74
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:20,457
- What has qualified you as such?
- I know the law...

75
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,461
since I have spent my entire life
in its flagrant disregard.

76
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,301
I had never killed a man before.

77
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,436
I'd shot at some...

78
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,770
in self-defense or blind fright,
but I never hit anyone.

79
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:42,609
So God must have directed my bullets.

80
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,749
Why, he even sent an angel...

81
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,153
to deliver this weapon.

82
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:53,158
Just how do you intend
to dispense this law?

83
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,853
With this. And a rope.

84
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,500
And will you rely again
on the grace of God?

85
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:02,769
I intend to practice...

86
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,802
and give him some help.

87
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:12,514
Get on with the reading.

88
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,241
I've turned to the Book of Psalms...

89
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:19,681
and I will read from Psalm number 58...

90
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,820
which I deem to be appropriate.

91
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:29,856
"Let their teeth be broken...

92
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,797
"and blunted in their mouths...

93
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,160
"the great teeth of the young lions.

94
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,639
"...he shall take them away
as with a whirlwind...

95
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,541
"both living, and in his wrath.

96
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:50,743
"The righteous shall rejoice
when he seeth the vengeance...

97
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:55,219
"he shall wash his feet
in the blood of the wicked.

98
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,382
"So that a man shall say...

99
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:01,156
"Verily, there is a reward
for the righteous...

100
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:07,293
"verily, he is a God
that judgeth in the earth."

101
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,872
What of them?

102
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,665
How do they fit
into your scheme of justice?

103
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:19,012
The law is going to protect them.

104
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,643
It says that somewhere in here.

105
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,995
Where is she?

106
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,720
Who? The angel?

107
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,397
If ever there was one.

108
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,336
¿Dónde está la muchacha?

109
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,296
Traigala aquí.

110
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,497
Does she speak American?

111
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,694
What is your name, señorita?

112
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:16,198
How are you called?

113
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,804
Marie Elena.

114
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:22,966
Marie Elena...

115
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:30,345
I want to thank you for what you done,
is what I want to do.

116
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,522
Maybe you can explain
to these people here...

117
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,515
that I mean them no harm.

118
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:46,296
Tell them it's going to be a new place.

119
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:49,303
It's going to be a nice place to live.
I'm the new judge.

120
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,496
There will be law.

121
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:54,233
There's going to be order,
progress, civilization, peace.

122
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:56,871
Above all, peace.

123
00:19:57,746 --> 00:20:02,149
And I don't care who I have to kill to get it.
Go on. You tell them that.

124
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,330
Tell them the horses
that belonged to them vermin are theirs.

125
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:21,767
Their guns.

126
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,100
The land.

127
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,932
Just that place...

128
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,706
That place there, that's mine.

129
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:31,744
They do not want the horses.

130
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,712
They will take the horses.
They do not want the land.

131
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,446
They are grateful.

132
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,820
They do not need the guns.

133
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,723
You are their patrón.

134
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:50,424
You mean I own everything
if I do all the getting shot at.

135
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,668
It is an old and fair arrangement.

136
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,437
And somewhat shrewd, I might add.

137
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,970
That brothel there...

138
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:03,111
it will be my courthouse.

139
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:06,814
Place to deal out justice,
place to get shot at...

140
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,212
and shoot and hang others from.
That's what it is.

141
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:12,943
I intend to live there, regardless.

142
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,721
What is it, my child?

143
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,860
I will live there, too.

144
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,785
She will what?

145
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,392
- You don't want me to live there.
- No, I don't.

146
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:29,428
Not yet, anyway.

147
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:32,296
Don't you have parents or the like?

148
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:36,706
Perhaps she could live in that little shack
off to the side.

149
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,112
Perhaps you could live in that little shack
off to the side.

150
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,756
"Blessed is the Lord thy strength,
which teaches thy hand to war...

151
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,922
"and thy fingers to fight."

152
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,591
I shall pray for you, Bean.

153
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:02,102
This land abounds
in ruffians and varmints.

154
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,799
Their numbers are legion,
their evil skills commensurate.

155
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,710
Piss on them.

156
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:16,242
That was the first and last time
I saw Judge Roy Bean.

157
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:20,553
I never got back to that country,
and died of dysentery in old Mexico.

158
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:24,292
I haven't seen him since,
so he probably went to Hell.

159
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,742
Lillie Langtry.

160
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:17,636
The Jersey Lily.

161
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:25,986
Fairest voice, softest hair,
eyes the color of a starlit night.

162
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,821
The most beautiful woman in all creation.

163
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,755
That's who that is.

164
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:47,037
Why, even princes drink champagne
from her slipper.

165
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:53,110
Look at the color of that hair.

166
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,948
I cannot see any color.

167
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,622
That's 'cause it's a bad likeness.

168
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,925
But even a bad likeness of Lillie Langtry...

169
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:10,062
is worth most women in the flesh.

170
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,769
Get back in there, child.

171
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,488
Who are you?

172
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:37,785
Big Bart Jackson.

173
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,752
This is my gang.

174
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:41,787
Tector Crites...

175
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,331
Whorehouse Lucky Jim...

176
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,502
Nick The Grub, Fermel Parlee.

177
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:52,302
- You outlaws?
- We're honest men.

178
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:56,800
Merely been driven to a life
beyond the law by circumstances.

179
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:59,070
You ever been here before?

180
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,279
Don't even know where I am now.

181
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,684
It's the Eagle's Nest,
Vinegarroon County, Texas.

182
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:09,021
Vinegarroon.

183
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,959
What is a "vinegarroon"?

184
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,258
Well, it's a Mexican word.

185
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:17,230
Means whiptail scorpion, mean as hell.

186
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:18,997
I don't want trouble from you...

187
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:21,661
only food, water
and some cactus whiskey...

188
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:24,398
if that sign's not an idle boast.

189
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,836
Nothing on that sign is an idle boast.

190
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,506
Including the law.

191
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,446
Got any money?

192
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:34,944
Not much.

193
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,075
We tried to rob the Three Rivers Flyer.
Couldn't catch him.

194
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:42,884
The passengers shot at us
from windows for sport.

195
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:47,161
Not easy being an outlaw
in times like these.

196
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,967
Ordinarily, I'd take you in my court
and try you and hang you.

197
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:02,169
But if you got the money for whiskey,
we can dispense with those proceedings.

198
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,208
- Do you get much judging around here?
- What do you mean?

199
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:16,621
I mean, what's the use of being a judge
if you ain't got no one to law?

200
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:20,861
Got a whole graveyard of previous cases.

201
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,324
I'll bet you could do even better
if you had more cases to try.

202
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:30,098
- That's right.
- What are you getting at?

203
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:34,068
What kind of court of law is it?
Has no marshals.

204
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:38,041
I don't need no marshals to back me up.

205
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:40,513
There's Judge Parker,
Fort Smith, Arkansas...

206
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:41,947
- Has marshals.
- Right.

207
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,111
- A wealthy and respected man today.
- That he is.

208
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:50,518
Marshals have to be
men of strong moral fiber.

209
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,225
Country like this, overrun with outlaws...

210
00:26:57,732 --> 00:26:59,597
Rich in possibilities.

211
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:08,440
I see no reason why the State of Texas...

212
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:12,909
through myself, could not provide...

213
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:17,843
half the booty and loot collected
as legal property of this court.

214
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:20,716
Split up four ways, I imagine.

215
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,455
- Five.
- Five.

216
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:27,726
Why, the State of Texas
would probably pay a bonus each month.

217
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:31,731
You mean, a bonus for the man
that does the most to the stopping...

218
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,759
of banditry and "outlawlessness"
that runs rampant in this land.

219
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:39,834
Providing I was able to find men of...

220
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,942
sufficient moral fiber.

221
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:51,819
Raise your right hands.

222
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:54,616
Do you solemnly swear
to uphold the letter of the law...

223
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:57,624
as stated in
The Revised Statutes of Texas, 1855?

224
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,388
And furthermore,
do you swear solemn allegiance...

225
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:02,760
and vow to uphold
the honor of Lillie Langtry?

226
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:04,487
- I do!
- Judge?

227
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:10,897
Can I be the bartender?
I've had my fill of being shot at for money.

228
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,473
What about that part about Miss Langtry?

229
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:17,634
That's the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in all my born days.

230
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:20,476
By the power vested in me...

231
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:23,312
through God and the great and honorable
State of Texas...

232
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:26,320
I hereby proclaim you
to be marshals of the court...

233
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:28,720
of the county of Greater Vinegarroon.

234
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,323
- For Texas and Miss Lillie!
- For Texas and Miss Lillie!

235
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,665
The whole thing was a mistake.

236
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:45,097
Why, I was framed from the start.

237
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:49,204
Set up by this two-bit vigilante judge
and his lynch mob.

238
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:52,342
They had nothing better to do.

239
00:28:52,547 --> 00:28:54,777
Besides, I was easy to catch.

240
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:09,185
This here is Sam Dodd, Judge.
Genuine murderer.

241
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:12,389
- Who'd he kill?
- Chinaman and his greaser wife.

242
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:15,368
- Stole a fruit jar full of money.
- How much?

243
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:17,004
Close to $90.

244
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,030
$90?

245
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,202
That's a serious crime, son.

246
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,475
Where's the evidence?

247
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:30,608
We buried the victims
no more than an hour after he done it.

248
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,716
Get down off that horse!

249
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:35,950
I don't cotton to looking up
to the likes of you.

250
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,356
Hear ye! Hear ye!

251
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:47,996
Court of Vinegarroon is in session.
There'll be no drinking.

252
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,761
Judge Roy Bean presiding.

253
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:58,234
Do you have anything to say
before we find you guilty?

254
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:01,106
I'm not guilty of nothing.

255
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:04,811
There's no crime that I've done wrong.

256
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,084
Do you deny the killing?

257
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:09,987
I do not deny it.

258
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,194
But there's no place in that book where
it says nothing about killing a Chinese.

259
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:21,364
And no one I know
ever heard a law on greasers...

260
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:23,731
niggers, or Injuns.

261
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,530
All men stand equal before the law.

262
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:33,278
And I will hang a man for killing anyone,
including Chinks, greasers, or niggers!

263
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:36,849
I'm very advanced in my views
and outspoken.

264
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,776
But there's no place in that book that...

265
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,254
Trust in my judgment of the book.

266
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,686
Besides, you'll hang
no matter what it says...

267
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,523
'cause I am the law.

268
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:50,389
The law is the handmaiden of justice.

269
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,964
Get a rope.

270
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,895
Let's go, Sam Dodd.

271
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,338
I want to say something.

272
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:00,966
Don't I get to say nothing?

273
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,410
By all means.

274
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:07,774
I want to say that I still believe
this whole thing is a mistake...

275
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:11,376
and that I am no worse,
and probably better...

276
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,977
than the men
who are about to end my days.

277
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:16,387
Well spoken, son. That's enough.

278
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,622
It was wrong to do this to me
for the crimes mentioned...

279
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:25,632
but I'd also killed white men
and stole their horses.

280
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,893
So I figured that
that's what I was being hung for.

281
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,428
My only concern was that
that rope be tied properly...

282
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,805
and the whole thing done right.

283
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:37,471
It was.

284
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,909
Verily, it has come to pass
that the wicked, outlaws, et cetera...

285
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:45,619
are going to have their teeth
blunted like lions...

286
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:50,520
with their necks stretched and broken.
This is the fate of the wicked.

287
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:54,220
And all this has come to pass
'cause it is the duty of the righteous...

288
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:57,230
which is us,
to hang the wicked whenever we can.

289
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:59,528
So that a man can say truly...

290
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:03,037
that God has appointed a judge
upon the earth.

291
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:06,369
That is how it is
and the way it will be. Amen.

292
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,473
- Amen.
- Amen.

293
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,406
Bar is open!

294
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:10,502
Two.

295
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:13,706
Two.

296
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,075
Two.

297
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,826
I'm Snake River Rufus Krile,
a long way from home.

298
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,929
Quit grinning.
Can't stand a man that grins.

299
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,860
I call that bet, and I'll raise you $10.

300
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,469
I'm blood kin to a Gila monster.

301
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,573
- Can drink my weight in wolf poison.
- One.

302
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:44,476
Massacre, bloodshed...

303
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:48,181
famine and drought
all put meat on my bones.

304
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,710
I'll see that and raise you $5.

305
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,386
Hardship and slaughter: my daily bread.

306
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,787
You in or out, Judge?

307
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,622
I'm considering...

308
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:03,027
I can whip a full-grown longhorn cow
with my hands tied.

309
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:07,158
Make violent love to mountain lions.
My trigger fingers are itchy.

310
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:09,665
I'm set to go, red hot.

311
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,867
Raise you $5.

312
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:52,442
Justifiable homicide.

313
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:59,513
I fine that man two bits
for firing a gun in a public building.

314
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:11,325
I also fine him...

315
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,568
$35, $45...

316
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:19,028
$52 for lying around.

317
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,810
Whorehouse, I call you and...

318
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,779
raise you $52.

319
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:34,982
I call.

320
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,350
Three bullets.

321
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:58,041
The marshals found
that the land abounded in opportunities.

322
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:00,171
And the pickings was easy.

323
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:03,276
Little did the varmints expect
the long arm of justice...

324
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,376
to reach them from within.

325
00:35:06,154 --> 00:35:09,453
Criminal vermin was plentiful
and of good value, too.

326
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:12,856
We had us a table piled high with silver
in no time.

327
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,693
And that was just the beginning.

328
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:04,038
The confiscated property
of them that was caught and hung...

329
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:07,308
allowed the Judge
to institute civic improvements.

330
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:15,352
Wagonloads of real, law-abiding citizens
came to settle.

331
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:20,388
The Judge himself became a man
of considerable wealth and consequence.

332
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,734
He verily papered the courthouse walls...

333
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:31,499
with posters of his true and fair love.

334
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:40,479
He even sent riders to the railhead
to bring back the New York Times...

335
00:36:40,548 --> 00:36:43,745
so he could follow the exploits
of Miss Langtry...

336
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:48,353
Jersey Lily,
voice as sweet as that of a nightingale.

337
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:50,918
I am...

338
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:54,294
disturbed by the news this morning.

339
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:56,690
What is it, Judge?

340
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,527
I am crestfallen.

341
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:03,268
Crestfallen?

342
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,502
Crestfallen by the...

343
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,104
report that Miss Lillie,
in a playful mood at a royal outing...

344
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:14,643
slipped a frog down the back
of His Highness Albert Edward...

345
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,342
Prince of Wales.

346
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,485
It was in a moment of frivolity,
you understand.

347
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:23,489
She slipped a frog
down this prince's neck?

348
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:26,488
Anyway, the Prince
was ruffled by the incident...

349
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,892
and disfavored Miss Lillie for it.

350
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,959
I suppose he would.

351
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:33,192
Suppose he would?

352
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:37,133
Ought to go over there
and hang the son of a bitch!

353
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:41,965
I would, too, except I got
too much respect for the royal family.

354
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:10,060
- Where'd you get that dress?
- You sent for it.

355
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,831
It sure didn't look like that
in the Sears and Roebuck catalog.

356
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:20,339
- Don't you like it?
- With all due respect to Miss Lillie...

357
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:24,916
I think she'd understand,
yeah, I like it a lot.

358
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:32,253
Just don't go wearing it around here
during drinking hours.

359
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,219
Sheriff! You better come quick!
There'll be an illegal lynching!

360
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,232
Hold it!

361
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:43,195
The only lynching around here
will be done according to the law.

362
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,035
Hell, Judge!

363
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,569
We got the tar and we got the feathers.

364
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,232
What is all this about, Bart?

365
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:53,610
We, as the decent folks of this community,
will not abide by pimp gamblers...

366
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,548
and women of the night
at prices like these.

367
00:38:56,617 --> 00:39:00,018
- What's the going price?
- $5, that's the price!

368
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:02,314
- Gold or silver!
- Outrageous!

369
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:06,118
I'd be willing to make a special rate
for you, Judge...

370
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:08,320
- considering that...
- No, sir.

371
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,420
What goes for my town goes for me.

372
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,429
Justice goes for all.

373
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,562
Justice is the handmaiden of the law.

374
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,964
- I was only trying to make amends.
- Amends!

375
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:28,644
What you have done to these...

376
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,374
gentle damsels...

377
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,750
I accuse you, sir,
of leading them down the primrose path.

378
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:40,860
Making them slaves
to passion and the dollar.

379
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,660
$5.

380
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,457
- $3.
- $2.50.

381
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,500
For you, Judge, nothing.

382
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,271
Get those ladies down
from that traveling bordello...

383
00:39:51,338 --> 00:39:53,863
and put them on the porch. You, sir.

384
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:58,403
Get out of my way.
That's it, come to me. I'll catch you.

385
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:03,606
I ain't going to sentence you, boy,
but I am going to warn you...

386
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:06,619
if you ain't out of here in five minutes,
I will open court.

387
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:10,088
- I haven't even got a horse.
- Steal one! A fast one!

388
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,058
Remember, we hang horse thieves
around here.

389
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,929
Spread out, ladies.

390
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:23,764
I didn't mean that.

391
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,136
What do you want
to do with them, Judge?

392
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,068
Just bear witness.

393
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:33,109
Bart, come here.

394
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,722
Fermel.

395
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:52,796
Right there. Right there.

396
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:59,706
Whorehouse, come here.

397
00:41:02,076 --> 00:41:03,475
Right there.

398
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:06,508
- Tector.
- Yes, sir?

399
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,016
- Come on out here.
- No, not me, Judge. I'm a benedict.

400
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:13,215
What about me, Judge?

401
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,561
Over here.

402
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:29,798
Ladies...

403
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,598
I intend to steer you back
to the path of righteousness.

404
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:37,701
I hereby sentence you to one year...

405
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,911
under protective custody of my marshals.

406
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,606
Bar's open! Drinks are on the house!

407
00:41:47,688 --> 00:41:49,417
I think, my dear...

408
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:52,949
that you are
a case for special consideration.

409
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:56,286
I hereby declare you a ward of the court.

410
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:12,305
A pig!

411
00:42:14,582 --> 00:42:17,551
I likewise advise you to find a fast horse.

412
00:42:38,572 --> 00:42:39,800
Hold it!

413
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:45,445
- All right, let's go inside.
- The Judge can handle it.

414
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:48,509
- Where you going?
- I am going for a walk.

415
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,785
Smell how sweet that air is.

416
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:05,031
It's almost tropical, that's what it is.

417
00:43:07,935 --> 00:43:10,802
In the desert at night,
in the moonlight, it smells like...

418
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:12,839
it could be a teeming jungle...

419
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:15,204
in Africa or India or the like.

420
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:19,940
And it makes me dream about this land.

421
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:22,776
What I'm going to make of it.

422
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,311
Someday it's going to be covered...

423
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:28,350
with farms and towns.

424
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,588
There's going to be a railroad.

425
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:33,124
Streets...

426
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,956
covered with brick.

427
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:38,620
Buildings made of stone, 100 feet high.

428
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:43,065
There will be factories
and slaughterhouses...

429
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:46,629
like I seen in those pictures
of Denver and Chicago.

430
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:53,211
And I am going to have a courthouse
made of granite, four stories high...

431
00:43:54,315 --> 00:43:58,081
so I can look down
and see that everything is going to plan.

432
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:03,346
And you can have anything you want.

433
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:06,482
You just think of anything you want.

434
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,460
A box that makes songs.

435
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,530
What?

436
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:13,157
A box that you open, it makes songs.

437
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,065
- Music box.
- Sí.

438
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:20,001
I would get you a pipe organ.

439
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:25,006
- What songs would you want it to play?
- Any songs.

440
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:29,548
You ever hear the Yellow Rose of Texas?

441
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:30,878
No, why?

442
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:32,450
You should have.

443
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:34,845
How does it go?

444
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,843
Sing more.

445
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,581
No, I can't sing.

446
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:14,319
It's cold in that shack where you live,
ain't it?

447
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:16,924
It's all right in the summer.

448
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:21,058
Yeah, but it's cold in the winter
and it leaks in the rain, don't it?

449
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,397
Sometimes.

450
00:45:24,371 --> 00:45:26,737
And the wind comes through.

451
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,874
Only when it's blowing.

452
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,838
Yeah, it is summer and the sky is clear,
there's no wind.

453
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:36,371
You should spend the night
in the courthouse so I can protect you...

454
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,111
from the elements.

455
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:41,065
What are you doing there
in the middle of nowhere, digging a hole?

456
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,073
A grave.

457
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:45,111
When that wheel come off the wagon,
I took it for a sign.

458
00:47:45,178 --> 00:47:48,079
- This here's my dying ground.
- Where you coming from?

459
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,716
Lived in the mountains mostly.
I was a mountain man.

460
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,275
Knew Jim Bridger, Kit Carson,
Liver Eatin' Johnson.

461
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:56,220
He was a good feller when he started.
But things get to him.

462
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,315
Went bad after a few winters.

463
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:01,190
Yeah, a man will do that.
What's your name, mister?

464
00:48:01,261 --> 00:48:05,027
I'm Grizzly Adams,
direct descendant of John Quincy Adams...

465
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,191
sixth President of the United States.

466
00:48:07,267 --> 00:48:08,757
His blood is in me.

467
00:48:08,835 --> 00:48:11,861
I went wild as a youth,
ran away to the mountains.

468
00:48:11,939 --> 00:48:14,373
Good life, free life, but cold.

469
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,773
So cold I'd go to the bears,
lie with them in their cave.

470
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:21,302
That's why I'm known as Grizzly.
I cohabitated with the bears.

471
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,983
What are you doing in Vinegarroon?

472
00:48:25,218 --> 00:48:26,810
All my life, I've been cold.

473
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:30,345
- I come south to die where it's warm.
- It's warm here.

474
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,355
There'll be no illegal dying.

475
00:48:34,962 --> 00:48:38,227
The only people that die in my town
are those that I shoot or hang.

476
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:39,660
Get along with you.

477
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:43,567
Can't die here! Can't die there! Man
can't even die where he sees fit no more!

478
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:45,468
I want no part
of what this world's come to.

479
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:47,507
I'm glad my days are at an end.

480
00:48:47,908 --> 00:48:50,069
That's Zachary Taylor, my oldest boy...

481
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:52,873
named after the 12th President
of the United States.

482
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:54,846
I prefer his company to that of men.

483
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:57,349
Pick up that wheel and move on.

484
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:03,447
Or I'll have you both strung up
for disturbing the peace.

485
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:11,264
Hurry up, mister,
this bear ain't getting any lighter.

486
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:21,740
How about adopting him, mister?

487
00:49:21,808 --> 00:49:26,074
He'll need someone after I'm gone
to love and be loved by in return.

488
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,241
Send him back to his mother.

489
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:33,043
She run off with another bear
from Colorado.

490
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,501
What do you think you're doing?

491
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,903
Come on back here and pick up your bear!

492
00:49:54,975 --> 00:49:57,808
- Good heavens.
- Give Zach a good home, mister.

493
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,444
Or sure as hell,
I'll come back and haunt you.

494
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:03,278
There now. Good bear.

495
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:19,832
Go on, run for it. You can't bluff me.

496
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,794
- Go on back to your father!
- Run, Judge!

497
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:27,599
Okay, stay where you are, damn it!

498
00:50:27,674 --> 00:50:32,202
- Come on, Judge, he's a monster!
- Nasty bear. You want to make friends?

499
00:50:42,489 --> 00:50:43,854
Go on!

500
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:04,473
Get in there now. Go on.

501
00:51:04,544 --> 00:51:07,240
Go to bed and lie down, you hear me?

502
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,779
I don't know which one he was talking to.

503
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,683
But either way
it must've been one hell of a night.

504
00:51:14,621 --> 00:51:17,488
The Watch Bear
moved right into the household.

505
00:51:17,557 --> 00:51:20,685
The Judge and him and Marie Elena
were inseparable.

506
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:23,924
The three of them
used to go picnicking together.

507
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,246
Dearest Lillie:

508
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,086
It was with fondest enthusiasm
that I received your letter this morning.

509
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:34,257
It was delivered to me while in court.
I dared not open it...

510
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:37,319
for fear that it would cause
me to reel in dazed ecstasy...

511
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:40,093
and forget the grave responsibilities
of my position.

512
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,326
We're ready, Judge.

513
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:44,529
Therefore I placed it
in a pocket over my heart...

514
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:47,332
where it has remained warm until now.

515
00:53:54,381 --> 00:53:57,214
I don't want to hurry you,
but the horse is getting nervous.

516
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:58,615
Quiet, you damn fool.

517
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:02,177
Can't you see the Judge is reading a letter
from Miss Langtry? Come on.

518
00:54:02,255 --> 00:54:04,985
Dear Mr. Bean: On behalf of Miss Langtry...

519
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,455
I wish to thank you
for your correspondence...

520
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:11,964
of April, March, February,
