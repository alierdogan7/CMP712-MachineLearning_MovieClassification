There.
It's from Mr. Clay.

No, looks like Mr. Williams did.

112

I don't want to risk another.

118
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,534
I don't have a man in this house.

119
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:48,005
I've got a boy.

120
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:51,141
Take him to Washburn Creek

121
00:08:51,143 --> 00:08:53,143
Maybe then I'll have two.

122
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:55,912

00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:58,247

Mr. Parcher's lived

this country could throw at him.

You stay close and mind him.

128
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,932

00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:37,552

132
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,704
Ida and Daphne.

133
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,412
I think those were their names.

134
00:09:49,564 --> 00:09:52,016

No.

136
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,837
Good.

137
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,609
I wonder

138
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,977
what kind of weapon
makes a wound like that.

139
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,748
<i>No scalping knife I know of.</i>

140
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,351
<i>Maybe some kind of chisel.</i>

141
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:46,050
That gun only fires twice.

142
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:50,355
He would have had
to have reloaded it

143
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,691
if he wanted to kill everybody.

144
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,963
Any Christian woman would
prefer dying to capture.

145
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,549
Mr. Williams had time to reload

146
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:04,335
because his wife gave it to him.

147
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:07,688
If it came to that,

148
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,457
I hope you'd be strong enough

149
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,025

150
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:33,996
I suppose a wild buffalo
could have done this.

151
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:40,754
Looks like you've found yourself
a hole in the ground there, will.

152
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:43,073
That and four corpses

153
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,075
and six missing,

154
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:47,727
most of those being
women and children.

155
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,379
I'll get the horses.

156
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,214

those women to have been...

163
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:08,113
Yes, so why aren't
we on the trail?

164
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:11,534
