00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,558
(INAUDIBLE)

2
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,897
Best not be
looking, Brownie.

3
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,900
I ain't looking.

4
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,402
As hard as I can!

5
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,403
(CHUCKLES)

6
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,074
Howdy.

7
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,076
Well, howdy!

8
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:44,831
Them pretty peach trees
are sure a long way
from Georgia!

9
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,836
Yeah, and I expect to
plant 'em where the ground
is 40 feet deep,

10
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,722
black as charcoal
and soft as a woman.

11
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,141
Now whereabouts
would that be? Heaven?

12
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,978
Oregon, mister,
haven't you heard?

13
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,480
Right!

14
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,432
(MEN CHATTERING)

15
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:09,405
I'll tie up, Pa.

16
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:12,492
All right, son.

17
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:17,997
It feels just like a holiday
I think maybe
I'll have me a little drink.

18
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,499
AUCTIONEER: All right,
ladies and gentlemen...

19
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,713
I hope I'm not
disturbing you too much?

20
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,716
No, but you're
disquieting the fish.

21
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,217
They're a sensitive race.

22
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,719
Dick Summers.

23
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,724
I've heard about you
ever since
I crossed the Ohio River,

24
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,009
and about as often
as God Almighty.

25
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,011
Well, I hope he doesn't
hold that against me.

26
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,515
I've come to ask
your advice about a guide
to take us to Oregon.

27
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,017
If you want my advice,
don't go.

28
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,019
Especially if you've never been there.

29
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,024
Now, people think a lot
of Jim Bridger as a scout.

30
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,526
What's your opinion?

31
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,027
Pretty good man.

32
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,031
What do you think of Mr. Sublette?

33
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,534
He's the best by far.
He's the best.

34
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,538
Sir, you're a liar.

35
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,461
Mr. Tadlock, I believe
you're beginning to get
a little bit personal.

36
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,464
No, sir, because the best man,
bar none, is you.

37
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,970
Well, I've got
a nice place to live here.
I got breakfast in the river,

38
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,973
dinner out there
in the woods.

39
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,526
This child's
just too fat and lazy to want to move.

40
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:13,029
A man who's hunted and trapped
from here to the Pacific,

41
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:15,315
not once but a dozen times?

42
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,317
That's right.
That's why.

43
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,819
I've made inquiries
about you, Mr. Summers.

44
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
You're not lazy.

45
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,573
You're sick.

46
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,542
Sick with grief,
and you have been
for two years.

47
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,544
Ever since
your Indian wife died.

48
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,546
You can get out now,
Mr. Tadlock.

49
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,550
You've been here
just about long enough.

50
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,474
Mr. Summers.

51
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,594
My woman died, too.

52
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,432
Listen to me.

53
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,434
I've got many families
coming with me.

54
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,937
Honest men,
women and children.
Good people.

55
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,939
For their sake,
leave this place,

56
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,941
ride your horse again
and take my wagon train

57
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,943
to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.

58
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,447
I can't guarantee I'd leave
anything behind me
except a string of graves.

59
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,449
Why? Do you think we're as
weak as all that?

60
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,951
No, not weak. Unfit.

61
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,954
Greenhorn storekeepers,
tenderfoot farmers,

62
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,507
people that never slept
in anything bigger
than a barn in their lives,

63
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,509
and never looked
at the frost
on the side of a tree

64
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,512
to find out
which way to go.
No, no.

65
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,014
Worse than us
have done better,
Mr. Summers.

66
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,969
We're mere men,
but a man's nature's enormous.

67
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,473
It contains both
the great and the small.

68
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,977
Even the meanest of us
can be as large as
this whole continent.

69
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,958
We can do without you,
Mr. Summers.

70
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,961
We'll lose more,
we'll suffer more,
but by God Almighty,

71
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:54,664
we mean to plant
a new Jerusalem
in the Oregon wilderness

72
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,550
By God Almighty,
that is a pretty speech.

73
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,256
You poor, miserable,
female-haunted man.

74
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,760
It's hard to believe
that your grief
has so corrupted your guts.

75
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,551
God dang it, Becky,

76
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,053
where'd you put the bed?

77
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,556

81
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,674
Oh, Becky.

82
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,681
All I've been thinking
about is you
all the time I was in town.

83
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,184
Quit it.
Now do you hear me?

84
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,937
You hear me?
I said, quit!

85
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,275
What the devil's
the matter with you?

86
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,413
You're going to Oregon.

87
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:51,330
What?

88
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,332
You already
made up your mind

89
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,118
and you're trying
to change mine
by getting me onto that bed.

90
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,120
Why, Becky,
I wouldn't be...

91
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,013
Woman,

92
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,016
I wish you'd stop
walking around
in my mind.

93
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,518
Lije...

94
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,638
Lije, we had a nice farm in Pennsylvania.

95
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,140
Too many stones,
you know that.

96
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,398
Lije...
Lije, stay home
this time.

97
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,402
I wish I could,
but I can't.

98
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,322
Why?

99
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,827
I don't know why, Becky.

100
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,882
It's just that I...

101
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,385
I gotta go
where I've not been.

102
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,423
And where I can say,
"This far I've come.

103
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,425
"I can't go no farther."

104
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,732
Do you understand that?

105
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,235
You're no good, Lije.

106
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,240
But you're the only
no-good man I got.

107
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,980
Well?

108
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,484
Well, get up and go.

109
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,985
The sun's risen.

NARRATOR:
On the 16th of April, 1843,

114
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:14,473
the sun rose in the east
and headed west...

115
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:20,479
%% Over Missouri

116
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:27,737
%% And the sun did say
today's the day

117
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:34,110
%% I'm going to pick up
that Liberty Train
and show them the way

118
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:41,250
%% The way west to Oregon

119
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:58,934
%% Write their names
on the mountains

120
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:04,890
%% Write their names
across the sky

121
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:11,781
%% Write their names
in giant letters

122
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:16,986
%% Ten thousand feet high

123
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:22,992
%% So the world
will remember

124
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:28,998
%% And their memories
will be blessed

125
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:35,888
%% That Liberty Train
to Oregon

126
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,258
Caravan!

127
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:45,648
%% The man
that took the way west

128
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:49,652
%% The way west

129
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:56,659
%% The way west %%

130
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,151
That's good shooting.

131
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,654
That was you who got him.
I missed him.

132
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,157
It's just because
I'm a little more hungry
than you, that's all.

133
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,807
You want him, Mercy?

134
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,810
Lord, no!
Looks like Ma's dog.

135
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,811
What is it?

136
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,314
He's a red fox kitten,
Mr. Summers tells me.

137
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,816
Lost his mama,
he thinks likely.

138
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,818
Five weeks old,
Mr. Summers said.

139
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,820
Mr. Summers,
Mr. Summers!

140
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,324
Tell your Mr. Summers
he smells a lot older
than that to me.

141
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,325
Phooey!

142
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,827
(CHUCKLING)

143
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,666
What are you laughing
about now?

144
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,453
That sweet good-looker
there, Mr. Mack.
New married man.

145
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:44,133
He fetched her flowers.
Imagine that.

146
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:49,138
Love.
Oh, I just can't wait.
Can you?

147
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,642
Oh, I could.
Don't know
if I will, but I could.

148
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,147
And what if
the right woman, like me,

149
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:02,651
just fell plump, warm
and happy in your arms?

150
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,654
I don't know.

151
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,158
I figure I could
manage if she did.

152
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,160
Well, come knock
on my porch,

153
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,879
say two or three years
from now.

154
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,381
(LAUGHS)

155
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,632
Darn you!

156
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,336
Mercy!

157
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,838
You're to stop your flashing
and a-fluttering every time

158
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,840
a three-legged boy runs by.

159
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,258
Now, you hear me?

160
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,762
If we don't get
that girl hitched
before we get to Oregon,

161
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,765
she's going to run off
and marry
the nearest buffalo.

162
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,933
(URGES)

163
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
Supper!

164
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,532
I think it's best
we ford right here.

165
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:05,014
Mr. Summers,

166
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,633
can you make that out?

167
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,970
SUMMERS: I can't see it
too well.

168
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,940
It's probably
a cattle train coming 
up from Santa Fe.

169
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,526
I see a wagon, Mr. Summers.

170
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:20,145
No cattle train.

171
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,899
What I see is Steve Brady
out of St. Joe
and bound for Oregon.

172
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,903
Well, maybe.

173
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,740
We'd best camp here
and make the crossing in the morning.

174
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,292
In the rain,
