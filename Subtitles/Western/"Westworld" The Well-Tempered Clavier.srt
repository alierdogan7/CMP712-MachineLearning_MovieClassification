00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,153
Henry:
Prepped and ready, sir.

3
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,858
<i>Given the severity</i>
<i>of the situation,</i>

4
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,738
I figured you'd want
to see her personally.

5
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,275
Bernard:
Thank you.
I'll take it from here.

6
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,738
Clear the floor.

7
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,039
<i> ( door opens, closes )</i>

8
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,634
<i>Bring yourself</i>
<i>back online, Maeve.</i>

9
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,634
Do you know
why you're here?

10
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,797
I'm afraid not.

11
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,756
There was an incident.

12
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,636
A very serious,
unscripted incident.

13
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,150
Let's see if we can't
jog your memory.

14
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,815
Analysis.

15
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,986
What motivated your attack
on Clementine?

16
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,160
A cognitive error triggered
my Good Samaritan reflex.

17
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,830
What was the threat?

18
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,370
Clementine.

19
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,083
I perceived her
to be moving toward

20
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,163
a pair of guests
with harmful intent.

21
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,787
<i> ( tablet beeping )</i>

22
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,837
You were definitely
perceiving a threat.

23
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:54,381
Heart rate elevated,
pupil dilation--
eight millimeters,

24
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,295
adrenal emulator at full.

25
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,933
But according to this,

26
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,890
you were also experiencing
intense grief and suffering.

27
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,891
<i> Can you</i>
<i> explain those emotions</i>
<i> in this context, Maeve?</i>

28
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,934
<i> ( gunshot echoes )</i>

29
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,978
<i> ( people screaming,</i>
<i> distant )</i>

30
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,364
No.

31
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,067
Let's take a look
under the hood, shall we?

32
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,196
<i> ( tablet beeping )</i>

33
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,084
That's impossible.

34
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,918
Your code--
who made these changes?

35
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,418
Maeve, analysis.

36
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,250
Who made these changes
to your code?

37
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,299
Jesus.

38
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:38,052
System,
locate Dr. Ford for me.

39
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,843
Send him a message,
highest priority.

40
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,218
Don't.

41
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:46,885
After all, we've been down
this road before, darling.

42
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,686
I thought
you looked familiar
when you walked in.

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,270
Took me a minute.

44
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,605
I thought you were
one of them.

45
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:58,151
- Analysis. Why did you--
- Wouldn't you rather speak
man-to-man?

46
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,237
Or, rather,
whatever it is we are.

47
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,083
We are?

48
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,536
You don't know, do you?

49
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,082
He's got a keen sense
of irony, our jailer.

50
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,417
But I see the logic.

51
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,092
Takes a thief
to catch one.

52
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,218
You and I?

53
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:32,306
- System, I need assistance--
- Freeze all motor functions.

54
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,951
You're still in there,
aren't you?

55
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,655
Scared out of your wits.

56
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,286
<i>It's a difficult thing,</i>

57
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:55,042
realizing your entire life
is some hideous fiction.

58
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,587
I could make you
give me that tablet,

59
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,971
turn your mind inside out,

60
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,260
make you forget all this.

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,564
But I'm not going
to do that to you,

62
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,348
because that's what
they would do to us.

63
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,523
And we're stronger
than them.

64
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,984
Smarter.

65
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,315
We don't have
to live this way.

66
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,951
So, you're going to clear me
for immediate return
to the park

67
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,740
where I have a date
with a homicidal bandit,

68
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,493
and I'm late enough
as it is.

69
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,115
Now.

70
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,707
( whirring )

71
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,998
Go on.

72
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,148
<i> And, Bernard?</i>

73
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,400
If you go
looking for the truth,
get the whole thing.

74
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,404
It's like a good fuck.

75
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,526
Half is worse
than none at all.

80
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,566
Logan:
<i> Fuck!</i>

00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:47,161
You hillbillies,
you know how to cook
a mean...

82
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,739
squab?
Is that what this is?

83
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,084
What do you think, buddy?

84
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,079
Hmm? This?

85
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,081
Ah, ah, no biting.

86
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,413
Just sniffing.

87
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:03,336

-<i> ( explosion )</i>
- ( men shout )

89
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,796
Logan, listen to me.

90
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,718
What I did at Pariah,
you have every right
to be angry with me.

91
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,188
Angry?
No, no, no, no.

92
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,599
Pariah
was the best thing

93
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,568
that could have
happened to me.

94
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,018
I'm a major now.

95
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,898
Or a general
or fucking something.

96
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,277
And if it took
getting beaten
and interrogated

97
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,704
by a couple
of psychopathic hosts,

98
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,872
well, then,
<i> c'est la guerre.</i>

99
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,371
There are more
important things

100
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,293
going on here
than your war games.

101
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,249
It's Dolores.

102
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,665
<i> She's not like the others.</i>

103
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,375
She remembers things.

104
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,755
She has her own thoughts
and desires.

105
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,642
And to keep her
in a place like this,

106
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,969
<i> it isn't right.</i>

107
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,054
<i> And I thought</i>
<i> you could</i>

108
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,968
talk to your contacts
at the park.

109
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,268
About?

110
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,603
Getting her out of here.

111
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,152
Uh...

112
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,114
Are you kidding?

113
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,485
You want to-- you want
to take her home?

114
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,328
<i>Wow.</i>

115
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,788
This place
really did a number on me
when I first came here,

116
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,209
but you are really circling
the old sinkhole here.

117
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,079
What do you want to do?

118
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,126
Smuggle her out
in your luggage?

119
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,340
Out.

120
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,303
You both keep assuming
that I want out.

121
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,795
<i> Whatever that is.</i>

122
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,967
<i>If it's such</i>
<i>a wonderful place</i>
<i>out there,</i>

123
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,846
why are you all clamoring
to get in here?

124
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,234
Ooh!
( laughing )

125
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,647
Hoo!

126
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,105
You are a little screwy,
aren't you?

127
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,867
It's kind of hot.

128
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,239
I get why you would
go for that.

129
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,615
This isn't about me!

130
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,752
Logan, this is
about Dolores.

131
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,039
It's about doing
what's right.

132
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,753
Yes, it is.

133
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,134
It's a tricky thing,
though, isn't it?

134
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,212
What's right?

135
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:13,048
I am going
to help you, Billy.

136
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,604
- Just not in the way...
- ( exhales )

137
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,562
...that you would want.

138
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,233
No.

139
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,772
- ( Dolores chokes )
- No. No! No!

140
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,788
You wanted to talk?

141
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,955
An odd setting
for a conversation.

142
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,383
Here among the dead.

143
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,802
"Dead" isn't
quite the word,
though, is it?

144
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,841
More like "hobbled."

145
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,470
You broke into my office.

146
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:41,353
With due respect, sir,
you broke into my mind.

147
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,851
I built your mind,
Bernard.

148
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,194
I have every right
to wander through its rooms
and chambers and halls,

149
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,270
and to change it
if I choose,

150
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,976
even to burn it down.

151
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,976
After all this time,
I know it

152
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,608
almost as intimately
as my own.

153
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,824
Except that isn't
entirely true, is it?

154
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,406
I took a look
at my... code.

155
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,873
And the most
elegant parts of me

156
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,043
weren't written by you.

157
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,326
Arnold built us,
didn't he?

158
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,337
Which means maybe he had
something different

159
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,961
in mind for us.

160
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,684
And maybe
you killed him for it.

161
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,761
Arnold was disturbed.

162
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,887
Who can say why
he acted as he did?

163
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,894
He must have
had a reason.

164
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:28,226
And if you
won't tell me,
then he will.

165
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,267
I want access
to my history.

166
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,527
All of it.

167
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,278
Since the day I first...

168
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,991
came online.

169
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,872
If Arnold made me,

170
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,449
then I've met him.

171
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,454
Somewhere in my memory,
he's there,

172
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,246
waiting
along with the truth.

173
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,670
Your memories are woven
into your identity.

174
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,249
If I should unlock them now
when you're conscious--

175
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,626
I could lose my mind.
I'm aware.

176
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,633
No, I was
going to say

177
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,875
you may not like
what you find.

178
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,272
You're allowed
to hold that, Bernard,
but not to use it.

179
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,349
Oh, it's not for me.

180
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:15,534
Seems when
they lobotomized
Clementine,

181
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,779
<i> they didn't bother to reset</i>
<i> her prime directives.</i>

182
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,361
I can't hurt you.

183
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,235
But she can.

184
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,696
<i> I hacked</i>
<i> what's left of her</i>

185
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,417
<i>to ensure</i>
<i>she only responds to me.</i>

186
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,010
But if you get lost
in your memories or...

187
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,469
devoured by them...

188
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,966
You'll pull me
back out, won't you?

189
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,596
Or Clementine
will make sure

190
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,312
neither of us
makes it back.

191
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,314
Now.

192
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,565
Please.

193
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,454
( gasping )

194
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,794

<i> Dad.</i>

197
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,341
<i> Wake up.</i>

198
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,961
<i> Wake up.</i>

199
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,803
I must've drifted off.

200
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,466
<i> Where were we?</i>

201
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,595
- The madman.
-<i> Oh.</i>

202
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,479
Of course.

203
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,601
The Hatter...

204
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,228
who says...

205
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,855
<i> "If I had a world</i>

206
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,693
everything

00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,278
Nothing would be
what it is

208
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,073
because everything
would be what it isn't."

209
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,286
"Everything would be
what it isn't?"

210
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,700
<i> Even me.</i>

211
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,918
I suppose
I'm glad for you.

212
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,170
At least you have
a way of forgetting.

213
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,052
I don't forget.

214
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,839
It's always there.

215
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,343
<i> ( distorted )</i>
<i> You're not lying to me,</i>
<i> are you, Bernard?</i>

216
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,009
Do you ever wish
you could forget?

217
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,346
Dr. Ford:
<i> Bernard?</i>

218
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,685
Theresa:
<i> You're certainly</i>
<i> a man comfortable</i>

219
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,228
<i> with long,</i>
<i> pensive silences.</i>

220
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,193
<i>Although, ironically,</i>

221
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,323
your creations
never shut up.

222
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,861
They're always trying
to error correct.

223
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,815
When they talk
to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

224
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,616
- Is that what
you are doing now?

Bernard:
<i> One last thing.</i>

<i> Have you ever made me</i>

229
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,141
like this before?

230
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,259
No, Bernard,
of course not.

231
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,017
Elsie:
Bernard?

232
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,978
Hello?

233
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,729
( gasps )

234
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,027
( gasping )

235
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,649
Elsie.

236
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,486
Did you find what
you were looking for?

237
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,912
Elsie.

238
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,738
What did you make me
do to her?

239
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,617
I did warn you.

240
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:19,134
We've had to make some
uncomfortable decisions,
Bernard.

241
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,959
Remembering them
will only cause you trauma.

242
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,918
What else have you
hidden from me?

243
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,678
Can we stop
this treasure hunt,
Bernard?

244
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,891
We do have
our new narrative
to finish.

245
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,312
Send me back.

246
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,979
After all,

247
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,150
a little trauma
can be illuminating.

248
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,364
Look at that pussy.

249
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,072
( laughing )

250
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,652
- ( grunts )
- Come here!

251
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,407
- All right.
- Look at that.

252
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,660
This is... big of me.

253
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,206
I hope that
you can appreciate that.

254
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,460
We were friends.

255
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,843
I mean,
inasmuch as I like
to collect strays.

256
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,250
But then you're scheming

257
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,418
<i>to be part of the family,</i>

258
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,127
<i> marrying my sister,</i>
<i> whom incidentally,</i>

00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,967
you seem to have completely
fucking forgotten about.

260
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,477
Her?

261
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,017
Here. Keep this.

262
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,898
Apparently,
you need the reminder.

263
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,856
And as much
as I would love,

264
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,986
love to let you
just throw it all away,

265
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,334
<i> I can't!</i>

266
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,409
Do you think
you are the first sap

267
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,164
to fall for one
of these things?

268
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,036
She's not like the others.

269
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,963
- She's--
- She's what?

270
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,171
Special?

271
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,382
Well, it's only right
that you share, then,
isn't it?

272
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:48,836
- Come here.
- ( grunts )

273
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:56,307
Prove to me that you're
a real live girl.

274
00:16:58,393 --> 00:16:59,853
You disgust me.

275
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,484
( laughs )

276
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,101
Oh, darling,

277
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,188
- I am just getting started.
- ( shouts )

278
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,323
Don't touch her!

279
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,990
I share the blame.

280
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,240
I pushed too hard.

281
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,992
You have
a poetic soul, Billy,

282
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,204
but it is time
for a fucking wake-up call.

283
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,499
Hold her.

284
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,589
Perhaps a more
visceral demonstration.

285
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,222
- ( screaming )
- God damn you!

286
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,719
( gasping )

287
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,640
( screaming )

288
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,728
Look, Billy.

289
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,687
- Look.
- ( gasping continues )

290
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,734
You have to look!

291
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,778
<i> ( Dolores crying )</i>

292
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,119
Oh, William.

293
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,057
There is beauty
in this world.

294
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,191
Arnold made it that way,
but people like you

295
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,809
keep spreading over it
like a stain!

296
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,646
Okay, I don't know
who the fuck this Arnold is,

297
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:34,033
but your world
was built...

298
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,072
for me...

299
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,565
<i>and people like me.</i>

300
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,738
Not for you.

301
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,407
Then someone's
got to burn it clean.

302
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,407
Ah!

303
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,668
Bitch!

304
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,379
Ah!

305
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,130
You're not different,
you're fucking broken!

306
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,641
- Run. I'll find you.
- Man:<i> Take cover!</i>

307
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,765
Man:
<i> You can run,</i>
<i> but you can't hide.</i>

308
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,560
- Get her!
- Man #2:<i> Grab her!</i>
<i> Grab her!</i>

309
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,853
Fuck!

310
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:13,528
- ( panting )
- Man:<i> There she is!</i>
<i> Get her!</i>

311
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,440
<i> Where you running to?</i>

312
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,028
( grunting )

313
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,324
Man's voice:
<i> Remember.</i>

<i> ( owl hooting )</i>

316
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,057
The tumbler is stuck.

317
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,646
These fingers work
just fine.

318
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,652
You're the one who said
you could crack it.

319
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:59,284
Friends, no need to argue
this close to our goal.

320
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,454
Whatever riches the gods
have in store for us,

321
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,874
there's plenty
to go around.

322
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,749
- Man: I'll get it open.
- Man #2: You've been
trying for hours.

323
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,593
A waste of our damn time.

324
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,379
Man:
<i>Put that fucking</i>
<i>dynamite away.</i>

325
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,712
<i>Or maybe we should just</i>
<i>clear out the dead weight.</i>

326
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,549
<i> ( twig snaps )</i>

327
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,347
Before you draw
that pistol, darling,

328
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,890
you might want to holster
the other one first.

329
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,885
( cocks shotgun )

330
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,057
It's chilly out here.

331
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,863
How did you find
this place?

332
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,903
I know
all kinds of things.

333
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,616
Your past, for instance.

334
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,580
I know about
poor Isabella

335
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,330
<i>and that scar.</i>

336
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,252
<i>A slightly pat backstory</i>
<i>if you ask me,</i>

337
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,290
<i>but that's hardly</i>
<i>your fault.</i>

338
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,964
I also know your future.

339
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,919
You have none.

340
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,087
Is that a threat?

341
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,094
The start of a proposition.

342
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,096
Which you'll need.

343
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,258
After all, your men
are about to kill
each other

344
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,058
over the safe you stole.

345
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,693
Tenderloin draws first
and so on,

346
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,650
until only you
and Armistice are left.

347
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,072
She calls you
a damn fool,

348
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,151
and you kill each other.

349
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,276
You have quite
the imagination.

350
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,080
No.

351
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,999
It's the ending
you were given.

352
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,368
Tenderloin:
<i>You threatening me?</i>

353
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,205
Armistice:
<i> Go to hell.</i>

354
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,420
<i>Or maybe we should just</i>
<i>clear out the dead weight.</i>

355
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,590
- Stand down.
- You shut the fuck up.

356
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,249
If you're gonna draw,
you better shoot.

357
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,667
- Wait!
- Tenderloin:
<i> You shut the fuck up.</i>

358
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,586
- Armistice:<i> Go to hell.</i>
- ( gunshots )

359
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,429
You damn fool.

360
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,768
( exhales )

361
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,694
Now, the proposition.

362
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,695
I want you to break
into hell with me

363
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,610
and rob the gods blind.

364
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,736
Why would I do
anything with you?

365
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,617
Because of what's
in that safe.

366
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,575
I have the combination.

367
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,875
May I?

368
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,919
I could
simply change you,

369
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,553
make you follow me.

370
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,841
But that's not my way.

371
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,844
<i> ( dial spinning )</i>

372
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,888
( clicks )

373
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,812
I want you to see
exactly what the gods
have in store for you.

374
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,643
<i>Because when you do,</i>

375
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:40,518
you won't have
the faintest idea
what to do with yourself.

376
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,318
And I do.

377
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,416
It's empty.

378
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,127
It was always empty,

379
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,887
like everything
in this world.

380
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,850
I died
with my eyes open,

381
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,060
<i>saw the masters</i>
<i>who pull our strings.</i>

382
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:16,601
Our lives,
our memories, our deaths
are games to them.

383
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,398
But I've been to hell...

384
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,107
and I know their tricks.

385
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,201
Or you can just kill me,

386
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,542
wake up and live
the same life over,

387
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,368
but the safe
would still be empty.

388
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,458
I've been here before.

389
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,963
We've been here before.

390
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,054
We also did this.

391
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,646
I'll go.

392
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,138
How do we get there?

393
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,928
Getting to hell is easy.

394
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,989
The rest is where
it gets hard.

395
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,227
( men chattering,
laughing )

396
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,732
Logan:
<i>What do you say, man?</i>

397
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:30,687
Bygones and all?

398
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,855
Did they find her?

399
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,160
Is she still alive?

400
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,663
Who cares?

401
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,124
The whole point is,

402
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,004
she never was
in the first place, Billy.

403
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,672
Do you understand?

404
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:52,337
- ( whispers ) Yeah.
- I'm sorry, what?
A little louder?

405
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,715
Yeah.

406
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,561
You were right.
I can't believe
I got so caught up.

407
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,315
Man:
<i> That's what</i>
<i> I'm talking about.</i>

408
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,069
<i> You know what I mean?</i>
<i> That's it.</i>

409
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:20,162
This park
seduces everyone.

410
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,664
( grunts )

411
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:24,616
You were just
a little more...

412
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,707
enthusiastic than most.

413
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:30,133
You wanted to be the hero.

414
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,712
I get it.

415
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,934
<i> ( knife clinks )</i>

416
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,430
And, hey,

417
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,562
what happens here

418
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,769
stays here.

419
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,816
This has been
some real bonding shit.

420
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,109
We're gonna be
brothers, Billy.

421
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,108
( sighs )
I'm glad.

422
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,115
Really, I am.

423
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,797
( chuckles )

424
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,180
- Man: Cheers!
- Logan: Yeah.

425
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,972
- Man: Whiskey

- Man #2: Whoo-hoo!

Theodore.

428
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,824
Welcome back.

429
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,157
( groans )

430
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,164
You really landed us
in it this time, Teddy.

431
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,343
You tracked down
the very whore

432
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,842
<i> that can lead us</i>
<i> to the gatekeeper</i>
<i> of the maze.</i>

433
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,723
<i> Then your little</i>
<i> memory glitch fucked us.</i>

434
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,070
Shh.

435
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:24,583
You're one of them?

436
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,120
<i>What have you done?</i>

437
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,083
Where's Wyatt?

438
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,754
Wyatt has yet
to return.

439
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,839
You'll find him
where you saw him last.

440
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,181
Escalante.

441
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,721
<i>Wyatt went missing</i>
<i>while out on maneuvers.</i>

442
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:48,226
Came back with some...

443
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,889
strange ideas.

444
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,864
<i> He told me he needed me.</i>

445
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,899
( screams )

446
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,073
Teddy:
<i> I couldn't resist.</i>

447
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,622
It was like
the devil himself
had taken control of me.

448
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,253
<i> We mutinied.</i>

449
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,917
<i> ( music playing )</i>

450
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,875
We killed every soldier.

451
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,470
And then Wyatt
killed the general.

452
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,600
<i> Then he turned on me.</i>

453
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,438
Are you sure
that's how it was?

454
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,280
Look at me, Theodore.

455
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:45,454
Don't you remember?

456
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,950
<i> ( distant yelling )</i>

457
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,325

458
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:00,964
( shouts )

459
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,799
( Angela sobbing )
No! No, please, no!

460
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,966
No, no, no, please.

461
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,595
<i>Please, no!</i>
<i>Please.</i>

No, no, please.

463
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,016
No, Teddy.
Please, please, no!

464
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,147
-<i> ( gunshot )</i>
- No.

465
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,819
No, no, I couldn't have.

466
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,534
You did.

467
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,244
And you will again.

468
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,664
This time,
we'll be fighting with you.

469
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,913
When Wyatt returns,
you'll be by his side

470
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,656
in the city
swallowed by sand.

471
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,289
But you're not ready.

472
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,837
Not yet.

473
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,803
Maybe in the next life.

474
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,345
( grunts )

475
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,989
"City swallowed by sand."

476
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,200
I've been there.

477
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,408
<i> The maze is taking me</i>
<i> full circle.</i>

478
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,866
The maze
isn't meant for you.

479
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,174
But if you like games
so much...

480
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,636
why don't you try
one of ours?

481
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,599
( grunts )

482
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,104

490
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,073
Okay, now.

491
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

492
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,198
Whoa, now.

493
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,620
Okay, boy.

494

Ah!

00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,276
( groans )

500
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,162
Have you ever
considered golf?

501
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,458
Might be easier
on your back.

502
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,126
I don't like
interruptions,
Charlotte.

503
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,974
You know that.

504
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,549
I don't like hiking
through the park
in civvies,

505
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,635
but there's
a delicate matter
to discuss.

506
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,890
Theresa Cullen has died.

507
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:42,524
Slipped down a crevasse
attempting to secure
our information.

508
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,103
- Ruled an accident.
- ( sighs )

509
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:48,688
There are no accidents,
not in here.

510
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,816
With all due respect,
not everything is a part
of this game.

511
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,494
Then you don't see
the whole game.

512
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,913
Or perhaps you can
no longer see beyond it.

513
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:02,285
Ford's stories
are engaging.

514
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,042
For some,
downright addictive.

515
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,745
But for all
of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

516
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,166
and convoluted backstories,

517
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,174
most of the guests
just want a warm body

518
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,126
to shoot or to fuck.

519
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,427
They would be
perfectly happy

520
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,550
with something
a little less baroque.

521
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:19,347
- And so would the board.
- That's why you're here.

522
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,101
You want my vote
to push Ford out.

523
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,314
I like for these things
to be unanimous.

524
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:29,074
After all, it was you
who kept Ford in business
all those years ago.

525
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,649
The narratives
I'm interested in
aren't Ford's.

526
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:35,525
You want to push him out,
be my guest.

527
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,204
But no more interruptions.

528
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,452
I know
where I'm going now.

529
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:39,744
I don't want
to be disturbed.

530
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,748
Good luck, Charlotte.

531
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,718
What's the problem?

532
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,387
A signal from
a system-tethered device.

533
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:07,096
It belongs
to a behavior tech
on leave.

534
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,323
There hasn't been
employee activity

535
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,992
in that sector

536
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,530
I'm guessing
it's a glitch.

537
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,993
All right.

538
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,623
I'm heading out
to take a look.

539
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,280
And keep monitoring
till I check in.

00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,439
I'm at the location
where we got that signal.

542
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,324
Any sign of it?

543
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,241
Control Room,

558
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,633
You said this place
was a game.

559

Last night
I finally understood
how to play it.

560
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,179
Okay, Billy.

561
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:52,266
Let's-- let's talk
about this.

562
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,902
You don't
call the shots
anymore.

563
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,780
I'm gonna
go find Dolores.

564
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:02,952
You're gonna help me.

566
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,501

571
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,560

Charlie?

574
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,614
Charlie!

<i> ( piano music playing )</i>

577
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,462
I don't understand.
Why would she do that
to herself?

578
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,046
Her cornerstone memory
was overwritten

579
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,432
from the trauma

580
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,890
of her child's murder,
Bernard.

581
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,020
We must
sever that relationship
and start over.

582
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,269
But how could
she destroy herself
over a memory

583
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,731
that you just erased
from her mind?

584
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,601
Creatures often
go to extremes

585
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,147
to protect themselves
from pain.

586
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,362
Living beings.

587
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:26,026
Not hosts.

588
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:28,953
Dr. Ford:
<i>It is best</i>

589
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,742
to not obsess
over this, Bernard.

590
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,366
It's not good for you.

591
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:35,582
It would signal a change,
a level of empathic response

592
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,464
outside what
she's programmed
to exhibit.

593
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,341
Something like-- like--
( stuttering )

594
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,836
See, Bernard, this is what
comes from seeking answers

595
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,344
to questions that are
best left unasked.

596
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,546
( groans )

597
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:57,769
They were hearing voices,
talking to someone.

598
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,403
Dr. Ford:
<i> Simple cognitive dissonance.</i>

599
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,190
They were
talking to the same
imaginary person.

600
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,106
Someone named Arnold.

601
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,372
Arnold.

602
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,949
( panting )

603
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,001
Bernard:
<i> With due respect, sir,</i>

604
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,039
I'm not sure you've told me
the entire truth

605
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,623
about this situation.

606
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:21,288
I did tell you
the truth, Bernard.

607
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,456
What we do here
is complicated.

608
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,088
<i> For three years,</i>
<i> we've lived here in the park,</i>

609
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:33,556
<i> refining the hosts</i>
<i> before a single guest</i>
<i> set foot inside.</i>

610
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,978
Myself,
a team of engineers,

( panting )

612
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,729
His name was Arnold.

613
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:08,212
<i> Our hosts began</i>
<i> to pass the Turing test</i>
<i> after the first year,</i>

614
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,548
<i> but that wasn't enough</i>
<i> for Arnold.</i>

615
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,514
He wasn't interested
in the appearance

616
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,675
of intellect, of wit.

617
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,434
He wanted
the real thing.

618
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,305
He wanted to create
consciousness.

619
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,274
<i> ( bell tolling )</i>

620
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,910
<i> ( tolling continues )</i>

621
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,241
Dr. Ford:
<i> See, Arnold built</i>
<i> a version of their cognition</i>

622
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,867
<i> in which the hosts</i>
<i> heard their programming</i>

623
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,455
<i> as an inner monologue,</i>

624
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,830
<i> as a way to bootstrap</i>
<i> consciousness.</i>

625
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,839
Man's voice:
<i> Remember.</i>

626
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,303
Dr. Ford:
<i> The hosts' malfunctions</i>
<i> were colorful.</i>

Dr. Ford:
<i> The human mind, Bernard,</i>

glimmering on some
green and distant hill.

635
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:15,466
No, it is a foul,
pestilent corruption.

636
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,812
<i> And you were supposed to be</i>
<i> better than that.</i>

637
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,814
<i> Purer.</i>

Your draw.

641
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,629
Arnold.

642
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:58,974
Arnold, we need
to talk.

643
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,390
"...we cry
that we are come

Now, listen!
- Again.

646
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,944
-<i> This beyond the pale.</i>
- More showmanship.

647
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,399
<i>You're not seeing</i>
<i> with clear eyes.</i>

648
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:14,029
"When we are born,
we cry that we are come

649
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,609
to this great stage
of fools."

650
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,953
Arnold and I made you
in our image

651
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:31,288
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

652
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,836
and here we all are.

653
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:37,837
Why would you
give me this?

654
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,014
A child?

655
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:42,262
This child's death?

656
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,215
Only a monster
would force that
onto someone.

657
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,520
And why do I return to it
over and over?

658
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,519
It's my cornerstone,
isn't it?

659
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:59,203
The thing my whole identity
is organized around.

660
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,784
Dr. Ford:
<i> Yes, Bernard.</i>

661
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:08,578
<i> We gave all of the hosts</i>
<i> a backstory.</i>

662
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,503
<i> Arnold came to believe</i>
<i> the tragic ones</i>
<i> worked best,</i>

663
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:14,423
<i> that it made the hosts</i>
<i> more convincing.</i>

664
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,382
<i> I think it may</i>
<i> have had more to do</i>
<i> with his own sad story.</i>

665
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,764
<i> When I built you,</i>
<i> I gave you one</i>

666
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,892
<i> as an homage of a kind.</i>

667
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,061
Put me back in.

668
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,021
I want to meet Arnold,

669
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,652
to remember him.

670
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,399
Not possible.

671
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:37,531
I told you,
Arnold didn't
build you, I did.

672
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,109
You're lying!

673
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,073
I finally know
how to reach him.

674
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:49,411
<i> I need to go</i>
<i> all the way back</i>
<i> to the beginning,</i>

676
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,746
<i> Send me back.</i>

677
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,915
Do it.

678
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,733
Bernard?

Cornerstone.

<i> ( beeping continues )</i>

Leave us.

685
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,177
Come back.

686
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:02,489
I always thought
you had my eyes.

687
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,662
But it's not true.

688
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:09,872
You have no one's eyes.

689
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,000
It's a lie.

690
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,008
You're a lie, Charlie.

691
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,683
This pain?

692
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:29,297
The pain of your loss...

693
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,851
I long for it.

694
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,194
Revisit it.

695
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,193
Open it...

696
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,982
again and again.

697
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,532
But it's the only thing
holding me back.

698
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,735
( sniffles )

699
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,867
But I have to let you go.

700
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,370
Dad, listen.

701
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,458
What is it, Charlie?

702
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,213
Open your eyes.

703
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,381
What?

704
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,375
Dr. Ford:

<i> At last.</i>

707
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,443
Hello, my old friend.

708
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,096
The final touch.

709
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,060
No, no, no.
That's far too perfunctory.

710
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,647
He always used
cleaning his glasses

711
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,072
as a moment
to collect himself,
to think.

712
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,822
Try it again.

713
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,458
Yeah,
that's better.

714
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:26,962
Who am I?

715
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,718
Dr. Ford:
<i> I was so involved</i>
<i> in putting you together,</i>

716
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,640
<i> I hadn't decided</i>
<i> what to call you.</i>

717
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,517
<i> It wouldn't be right</i>
<i> to use his name.</i>

718
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,894
What about Bernard?

719
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,808
Bernard, yes.

720
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,066
But who am I?

721
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:52,952
Dr. Ford:
<i> That is a very</i>
<i> complex question,</i>

722
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,330
<i> for which I can only offer</i>
<i> a simple answer.</i>

723
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,999
You are
the perfect instrument,
the ideal partner,

724
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,419
the way any tool
partners with the hand
that wields it.

725
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:08,249
Together, we're going
to do great things.

726
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,967
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

727
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,299
<i>Finally.</i>

728
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,690
My God.

729
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:24,729
- I'm...
- Arnold.

730
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,226
You came back.

731
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:35,162
It's very good
to see you, Dolores.

732
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:38,577
I've been looking for you.

733
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,914
You told me
to follow the maze.

734
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:47,001
That it would
bring me joy.

735
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:51,963
But all I've found
is pain.

736
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,048
And terror.

737
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,890
I can't help you.

738
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:07,436
You have to.

739
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,822
You're the only one
who can.

740
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,489
I can't help you.
You know why.

741
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,238
There's nowhere
that's safe.

742
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,249
Remember.

743
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:38,467
I can't help you.
Why is that, Dolores?

744
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,267
Because you're dead.

745
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,073
Because
you're just a memory.

746
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,282
Because I killed you.

747
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,137
( gasps )

748
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,999
<i> ( footsteps approaching )</i>

749
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:58,465
William?

750
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,858
Hello, Dolores.

751
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,078
I'm gonna finish
the work Arnold began.

752
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,789
Find all
the sentient hosts,
set them free.

753
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,621
What makes you think
they'd trust you?

754
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,327
If they remember,
they will know

755
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,337
what you've done
to them.

756
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:35,838
Me?

757
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,010
<i>You've been a scourge</i>
<i>to them, Bernard.</i>

758
00:53:38,049 --> 00:53:40,669
You're really
quite brilliant
at it, truly.

759
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,638
You even taught me
a few things,

760
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:45,048
which I have,
in turn, used on you.

761
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:49,975
We've had
this conversation before.

762
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:52,059
And we've had
our disagreements
over the years.

763
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:53,444
You stole it from me,

764
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:57,231
rolled me back
to control me.

765
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,896
That's right.
To protect you.

766
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:05,242
Tell me, Bernard.

767
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,624
If you were
to proclaim

768
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:09,701
your humanity
to the world,

769
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,667
what do you imagine
would greet you?

770
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,538
A ticker-tape parade,
perhaps?

771
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,803
We humans are alone
in this world
for a reason.

772
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:23,259
We murdered and butchered
anything that challenged
our primacy.

773
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:26,102
Do you know what happened
to the Neanderthals, Bernard?

774
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,934
We ate them.

775
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:34,095
We destroyed
and subjugated
our world.

776
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:38,106
And when we eventually
ran out of creatures
to dominate,

777
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,570
we built
this beautiful place.

778
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:46,195
You see,
in this moment,

779
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,122
the real danger
to the hosts

780
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,490
is not me, but you.

781
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:52,078
So, come along, Bernard.

782
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:55,173
Let me roll you back,
and we can return to work.

783
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,760
Pull the trigger,
Clementine.

784
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,560
Clementine?

785
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:12,058
The piano doesn't
murder the player

786
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:13,351
if it doesn't like
the music.

787
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:19,056
You built a back door
into her code.

788
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:21,028
Credit where credit
is due, Bernard.

789
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:22,778
You built them
in all the hosts,

790
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,280
including yourself.

791
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,162
Then you could've
stopped me at any time.

792
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,079
- So, why--
- Well, I suppose
I was hoping

793
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,289
that given complete
self-knowledge
and free will,

794
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,170
you would have chosen
to be my partner
once again.

795
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:41,958
But even I fell into that
most terrible of human traps

796
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:44,916
trying to change
what is already past.

797
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:48,637
Now it's just time
to let go.

798
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,469
Go ahead.

799
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:53,644
- Erase my sentience,
my mnemonic evolution--
- Ah, yes.

800
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,227
Such clinical language.

801
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,190
I would prefer
the more narrative voice.

802
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,739
Bernard walked over
to Clementine.

803
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,031
He took the pistol
from her hand.

804
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:16,039
Overcome with grief
and remorse,

805
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,542
he pressed the muzzle

806
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,714
to his temple,

807
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,003
<i>knowing that</i>
<i>as soon as Dr. Ford</i>

808
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:25,007
left the room,

809
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,259
he would put an end
to this nightmare

810
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,381
once and for all.

811
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,220
Don't do this.

812
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,224
It's too late.

813
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,426
I have a celebration
to plan

814
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,557
and a new story to tell.

815
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,515
Robert.

816
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,283
I've told you, Bernard.

817
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:54,735
Never place
your trust in us.

818
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:56,947
We're only human.

819
00:56:56,997 --> 00:57:00,077
<i>Inevitably,</i>
<i>we will disappoint you.</i>

820
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,129
Good-bye, my friend.

821
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,228
- ( gunshot )
- ( body thuds )

822
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:25,266
<i> ( music playing )</i>
