1
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,707
<i>João!</i>

2
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,999
<i>Come João.</i>

3
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,457
Mother.

4
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,457
<i>If it was up to the world...</i>

5
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,915
<i>there would be no place</i>
<i>for me in it.</i>

6
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,165
<i>That's what I spend my life</i>
<i>looking for.</i>

7
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,832
<i>But there are things we</i>
<i>choose ourselves...</i>

8
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,790
<i>and there things that choose us.</i>

9
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,165
<i>And I was born with lots of</i>
<i>unfinished business to settle.</i>

10
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,207
Tonho, get me a shot of cachaça.

11
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,332
Another one.

12
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,832
Hold it right there.

13
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,040
<i>I had nothing to lose.</i>

14
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,499
Drive.

15
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,790
<i>That's why I was not afraid.</i>

16
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,207
Don't do it, kid.
You're young.

17
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,165
Don't do such a stupid thing.

18
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:23,957
Get out of the car.

19
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,499
I told you to get out.

20
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,082
On your knees.

21
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,790
Don't you do such a terrible thing.

22
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,790
You'll kill me...

23
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,790
<i>Sometimes...</i>

24
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,749
<i>we must kill a few</i>
<i>things in order to plant...</i>

25
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,957
<i>to water,</i>
<i>and be born, again.</i>

26
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:34,040
Wait, wait.

27
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,749
<i>A real man always pay his debts.</i>

28
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,790
-There he is!
-Stand up!

29
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,249
Stand the fuck up!

30
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,082
JUVIE - BAHIA

31
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,665
<i>And I have paid...</i>

32
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,915
<i>up to the last penny.</i>

33
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,040
<i>Then I turned to my path.</i>

34
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,207
<i>But now, times were different.</i>

35
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,957
Good evening, Brasilia!

36
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,624
One, two, three, four!

37
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:48,957
<i>We live in the city</i>
<i>And so does the president</i>

38
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:53,790
<i>Everybody pretends</i>
<i>To live a life that's decent</i>

39
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:59,957
<i>But I don't mean</i>
<i>To be so decadent, no</i>

40
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:05,957
<i>Boredom whit a big B</i>
<i>Just for you!</i>

41
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:14,665
<i>Walk under the rain</i>
<i>Sometimes I dig it</i>

42
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,499
<i>I have no fuel</i>

43
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,165
Do you have some good stuff on you?

44
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,457
-What?
-Do you have some good stuff?

45
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,499
-I do. Show me the money.
-I'll pay you tomorrow.

46
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,749
-You'll pay me tomorrow?
-Tomorrow...

47
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,540
I just got this glass.

48
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,457
<i>I live in Brasilia!</i>

49
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,790
ARAGUARINA STATION

50
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,290
FREIGHT

51
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,665
Hey, man, what is it?
What are you doing?

52
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,540
-I want no bum in here.
-I ain't no bum.

53
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,915
I was wondering if you know
a relative of mine.

54
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,332
Who's it?

55
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,540
Pablo.

56
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,540
Go on.

57
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,332
-Do you know him?
-He's well known here.

58
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:32,332
I'm the son of Mazé and Vicente.
From Santo Cristo.

59
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,582
My father told me
I could look for you.

60
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,790
You look like your mother.

61
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,707
Do you want a smoke?

62
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,957
Relatives tend to show up
when they're fucked up.

63
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,707
And you're fucked up,
aren't you?

64
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,332
You're thirsty, you're hungry,
you're cold...

65
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,874
and you have nowhere to crash,
isn't that so?

66
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,790
I'll get you some food.
Come on.

67
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,124
-Do you like scotch?
-I'm not used to it.

68
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,790
Money changes people's tastes.

69
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,290
Do you know what I do
for a living?

70
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,332
I begun selling very nice
stuff here.

71
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,415
Some coming from Bolivia,
some coming from Paraguay.

72
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,290
-For real? Paraguay?
-Yeah.

73
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,874
I'll introduce you to my girl, but
this one, you can only look at.

74
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,790
Teresa, come over here!

75
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,790
She is the true reason
I stayed in Brazil.

76
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,290
Teresita!

77
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,457
You're so rude!

78
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,207
This is my cousin, João.

79
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,665
Are you sure?

80
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,582
I told you, my father was Brazilian.

81
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,457
You're the first relative Pablo's
introduced me to.

82
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,665
First and last,
the rest is dead.

83
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,082
Better scrannel than without a nose!

84
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,582
<i>Pablo told you to come here, right?</i>

85
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,124
He told you what I really need
in a watchman, didn't he?

86
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,124
If you want, I can do both.

87
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,082
That's fine. You're hired.

88
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,665
Stop playin' this shit, man.
Play something good.

89
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,665
That's it! Now that use your anger
to play Clash, Ramones.

90
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,082
Play Pistols.

91
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:43,540
If you go to Berlin to play this
shit, you're screwed.

92
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,332
You're going to have a short career.

93
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,082
You'll be deported right away.

94
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,290
Hey.

95
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,665
What's up?

96
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,207
<i>Maria Lúcia.</i>

97
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,582
I'm going home, I'm tired, Chris.

98
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,582
-Wanna a ride?
-No, that's cool, I'll ride with Beto.

99
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,207
Snap out of it, Mary...
I'll call you.

100
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,165
<i>What is this mess?</i>

101
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,165
<i>Answer me, boy!</i>

102
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,999
<i>Look amount of wood you chopped!</i>

103
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,165
Do you want to wreck my business?
Drive me bankrupt?

104
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,207
I used the night to make a chair.

105
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,082
And it's got no nails.

106
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,999
The good indeed. Who's gone ask us to
fix something that never breaks?

107
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,415
<i>Massul told me you're</i>
<i>a big help.</i>

108
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,999
You're alert all night long.

109
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:15,957
Too far?

110
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,040
Winchester 22.

111
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,082
Does it work?

112
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,165
I'll show you.

113
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,165
Your turn.

114
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,290
This way.

115
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,915
You have to look
where the prey is.

116
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,040
Where you have to shoot.

117
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,832
Let's go?

118
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,415
Let's go. I'll bring you
some candy later.

119
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,915
Come on, shoot it.
We don't have all day!

120
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,540
Luck shot!

121
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,957
God damn! Fuck you!

122
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,165
Pick it up!

123
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,165
Fuck you, bro! Wanna kill me?

124
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,957
Today, you're gonna make
a delivery for me.

125
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,540
It won't take long.

126
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,832
Barata, you'll stay
at Massul's tonight.

127
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,790
I'll pay you good money.

128
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,957
Or do you want to sleep forever
in that shitty shack?

129
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,790
Saci, come on in,
goddamn it!

130
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,165
Here it is, almost gone.

131
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,999
What is your problem?

132
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,957
Maria Lúcia, you can't stay home
for the rest of your life.

133
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,832
Chris, I'm not going out.

134
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,832
Maria Lúcia.

135
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,915
-Get rid of it, get rid of it!
-Will do.

136
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,165
Just tell you I'm home!

137
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,707
Did you bring the money?

138
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,207
Police!
Hands on your head!

139
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,999
On the floor!

140
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,832
Fucker.

141
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,790
Here you go.

142
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,707
This is enough! Go on!

143
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:11,707
You, little thief! Put it back!
I saw you taking it!

144
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,832
Take your hands off him,
you son of a bitch.

145
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,040
Put it back, boy!

146
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:18,707
You like hitting children?

147
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,915
I don't want my son to be
a thief, understood?

148
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,999
Did he hurt you?

149
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,165
When we get home
you help your mother pack.

150
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,582
We are living tomorrow, first light.

151
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,582
Okay.

152
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,832
Let's pedal, we're too slow.
Climb on.

153
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,999
Run into the woods, go.

154
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,582
Hurry up!
I'm telling you!

155
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,665
Go, kid.

156
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:18,540
Who do you think you are to hit my
brother, your nigger, son of a bitch?

157
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:35,582
-Gee, the nigger is fast...
-Goddamn it, yeah!

158
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:37,957
You go to the entrance.

159
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,999
<i>Marco Aurélio.</i>

160
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,582
<i>Look around here,</i>
<i>I'll check the back!</i>

161
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,165
<i>This guy is surrounded</i>
<i>on this block.</i>

162
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:14,582
<i>Chris.</i>

163
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,832
-What's up, you loony?
-Have you forgotten?

164
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,415
<i>Renato, come back</i>
<i>the guy is not here.</i>

165
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,415
Gimme a smoke, man.

166
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:17,957
Don't scream! Don't scream!

167
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:24,415
Don't scream! Some guys are chasing
me. I'll just hide and I'll leave.

168
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:26,415
Calm down...

169
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,707
Maria Lúcia, I told you
I'm home already.

170
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:52,915
Maria Lúcia.

171
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,790
-Yes?
-Good evening.

172
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,832
-Good evening, Mr...?
-Ney.

173
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,582
Mr. Ney, I'm detective
Marco Aurélio.

174
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,415
There's a crook at loose
in the neighborhood.

175
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,957
We're warning the residents
to keep their doors...

176
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,790
No, there's nobody here.

177
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,915
-Mr. Ney, if I could at least just...
-Senator...

178
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:41,415
Right.
Sorry to bother you, sir.

179
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,707
<i>Maria Lúcia?</i>

180
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,790
I'm changing clothes, dad.

181
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:53,332
-Close your window before bedtime.
<i>-Okay.</i>

182
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:25,999
My name is João.

183
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:12,332
Mr. Jeremias, that man's
here to see you.

184
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:14,165
Say it, Bones.
Go!

185
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,915
-Marco Aurélio. Titties!
-Hands off, dude.

186
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,582
-What's wrong? Had some milk?
-I like your haircut.

187
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,165
Come, I got a gift for you.

188
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:29,582
-Really?
-Yeah, come on.

189
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,957
-Please.
-Ladies first...

190
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,582
My share I want in cash.

191
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,832
Look, there's a fortune
there, little girl.

192
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:38,832
Here.

193
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:45,540
This here is the one
I told you about.

194
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,207
I got it from the
two-bit drug dealer.

195
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:52,582
Have some fun here,
while I roll up a joint there.

196
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,957
What do you mean? I'm
no Bible-thumping preacher.

197
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:57,915
I wasn't either,
until read Luke's Gospel.

198
00:30:58,583 --> 00:30:59,832
I found Jesus.

199
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,665
-I saw it in a movie.
-Look, a little pen tube.

200
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,582
So you can underline
the parts that touch you deeper.

201
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,165
Oh, my freaking God!

202
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:13,165
So, who was my competitor?

203
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,582
It was a two-bit nigger selling
for a couple of rich kids.

204
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,540
The bastard ran like hell,
but never mind.

205
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,165
I know he, bastard, is from Ceilândia
and if he shows up again...

206
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,415
-I'll bring him to you.
-Good for you.

207
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,165
Chill out, man.

208
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:29,165
Come on, your old man
always trusted me. Didn't he?

209
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,957
So that shit I apprehended...

210
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:38,165
This is any, but shit.

211
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,915
This isn't the first time that
fucker messes up with us.

212
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:43,582
Always on that Plano Piloto.
I'm tired of losing.

213
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,332
This time, you didn't lose.

214
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:49,165
-Here's the money.
-At least this.

215
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:57,082
Your cut. Now, go
rent your shack.

216
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,165
It comes from abroad.

217
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,915
I only deal with the best.

218
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,374
What do you want from me?

219
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:24,582
I came to thank you.

220
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,082
-This time, I'll call the police.
-No need.

221
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,790
It's all cool.

222
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:39,957
Here.

223
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,790
You're cocky, you know?

224
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,999
-Did you like that?
-Pretty.

225
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,124
But no, thanks.

226
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:22,040
I'd like to invite you
to go a cool place.

227
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,665
-No.
-Come on.

228
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,124
You have nothing better
to do, anyway.

229
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,165
You're really crazy, you know?

230
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,082
Okay, fine.

231
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,082
Hey!

232
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:44,582
-Is this the place?
-Not yet.

233
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:46,957
Not yet?

234
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:54,832
What are you doing?

235
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,790
I'm gonna dive in.

236
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,124
Come on, baby.

237
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,040
Come in! Are you
afraid of the cold?

238
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,957
Come.

239
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:42,957
Have you ever been here?

240
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:49,707
-Not like this.
-So you never knew this place.

241
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,332
-It's cold.
-I'll warm you up.

242
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,874
No, let's get out.

243
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,874
You're one big pothead.

244
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,707
And you are a thug.

245
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:32,624
-I'm not a thug.
-Yeah, right.

246
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,790
I own a carpenter shop.

247
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:41,124
What were you doing in my
neighborhood that day? Selling wood?

248
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,874
That's my cousin's business,
but I won't do it anymore.

249
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,999
What about you?
Where do you work?

250
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:04,082
I don't work.

251
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,582
I'm studying to
be an architect.

252
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,874
That's hard.

253
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,207
I'm an architect, and
you're a carpenter.

254
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:15,915
Yeah...

255
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,582
The rich plan it, and
the poor build it.

256
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,124
That's awful!

257
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,582
Do you think it's like that?

258
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:43,832
Now, I'll pin you down.

259
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,582
No. No, no, no.

260
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,957
I'm a thug, ain't I?

261
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:51,957
Yeah...

262
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,624
No.

263
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,790
Small time thug.

264
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:10,124
-Is this how you like it?
-No.

265
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,207
I like when you tell
the truth.

266
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,540
-Pablo?
-Yep.

267
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,040
I need a little weed.

268
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:33,790
-Are you hooked already?
-No. It's for a girl.

269
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,415
Give the chick any crap.
She'll like it fine.

270
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:40,874
She's from Asa Sul. What they
smoke down there is pure shit.

271
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:44,957
Why do you think I sent
you down there for?

272
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:48,374
I can pay you.

273
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,332
Come with me.

274
00:42:57,333 --> 00:43:00,957
Good morning.

275
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,624
Have you changed your mind?

276
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:12,457
You're the only one who
refuses to pay the taxes.

277
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,040
I don't even pay taxes
to the government.

278
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:18,374
I take care
of the people around here.

279
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:23,332
Everybody knows that.
Why aren't you grateful too?

280
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,790
I hate ungratefulness!

281
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,624
-Enough, Pablo.
-Shut up!

282
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:31,790
The money, now!

283
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,540
Are you insane, motherfucker?
I'm the boss here.

284
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:36,624
Damn.

285
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:58,832
Barata, gimme some weed.

286
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:04,957
For your chica.

287
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,624
No need to pay.

288
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:25,790
<i>What's this?</i>

289
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:27,665
What?

290
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,290
A term project,
I presented today.

291
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,999
I brought you a joint,
if you want s hit.

292
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,957
No, it's risky here. We'd better
smoke in the car.

293
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,540
Give that to me.

294
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,582
-I'll help you.
-No thanks. It's okay.

295
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,165
It's the Anthropology Building
back here.

296
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:46,165
I'll minor in Anthropology too.

297
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,540
I'll toss here.

298
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,624
-Let me...
-No, that's okay.

299
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:54,707
You drive. I'll stick it here,
but it won't hinder the gear.

300
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:55,874
Let's go.

301
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,207
The key's upside down.

302
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:07,290
Okay...

303
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:18,832
Can you drive?

304
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,124
Of course I can!

305
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,332
Careful with the reverse gear,
it's a little...

306
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:29,582
What are you laughing
about, girl?

307
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:37,457
Slowly.

308
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:41,415
Oh, my God!

309
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,332
-I did it, I did it!
-It isn't raining...

310
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,165
Turn around here.
Turn here.

311
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,457
-Here! I can do it!
-No, no!

312
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,957
I hit my head.

313
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,374
Look...

314
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:40,790
Maria Lúcia brought her
father's bodyguard.

315
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:45,790
You're here.

316
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,624
Do you smoke weed, man?

317
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:53,540
No, not this kind.
It tastes of cow shit.

318
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,332
Hey, Jeremias!

319
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,207
This dude says your
weed's like hay!

320
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:03,207
-Stop man.
-It's like cow dung!

321
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,874
He said he can find us
much better weed.

322
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,874
Really? Where does
his weed come from?

323
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,624
If it is good I
want some too.

324
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,624
Say something.

325
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:13,790
You offend me in my house.
Cat ate your tongue?

326
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:18,624
-Who invited you here... Pelé?
-I invited him...

327
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:21,124
but he's on his way out.
Let's go, João.

328
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:26,165
Maria Lúcia, let me know shall
you bring the doorman's son.

329
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:31,124
-Let's go João, please.
-Go away, Pelé!

330
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,124
Let's go.

331
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,207
Holy fuck!

332
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,124
This is good stuff,
isn't it, Betão?

333
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,374
The best.

334
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,582
Who's that cheeky fucker
with Maria Lúcia tonight?

335
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:47,040
Maria Lúcia's nuts.
She's insane.

336
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:52,832
Who was the dude?

337
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,707
-Who? Beto?
-The other sucker. Your boyfriend?

338
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,374
Of course not?
I don't date crooks.

339
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,707
He's a lowlife playboy dealer.

340
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:06,832
He's an army brat,
his old man is stationed abroad.

341
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,624
He was a classmate, nothing more.

342
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,124
Goddamn...

343
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:15,290
finally, some good
weed in this town.

344
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,124
Fan-fucking-tastic.

345
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:19,665
Enjoy it while you can,
cause this is the last one.

346
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,040
You can get some more,
can't you, João?

347
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:25,707
Don't bother him, Chris.

348
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:29,165
I think I can manage that.

349
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,374
Why did you bring me here?

350
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,582
This good land is for sale.

351
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,124
Why would I buy that?

352
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:43,415
-I hate woods.
-I miss a good field to farm.

353
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:59,207
<i>All I had to do, then,</i>
<i>was fulfill my need to plow.</i>

354
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:05,207
<i>If the soil is good, you harvest</i>
<i>wherever you plant.</i>

355
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,040
<i>As the President João Figueiredo</i>
<i>used to say:</i>

356
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,374
<i>"Plant it and João ensures it."</i>

357
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,082
<i>But for Maria Lúcia...</i>

358
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,999
<i>I reassured I was</i>
<i>only a carpenter.</i>

359
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:25,582
<i>I was making money and she taking</i>
<i>care of the future.</i>

360
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:37,415
<i>Soon, the city¤s potheads</i>
<i>were aware of the news.</i>

361
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,999
Oh yeah! There's a
good stuff for sale.

362
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:50,582
<i>If anyone remembers smoking</i>
<i>an excellent weed in the 80's...</i>

363
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,082
<i>I most certainly didn't</i>
<i>buy it from me.</i>

364
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:56,582
<i>Because, if it was, he wouldn't</i>
<i>remember anything.</i>

365
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:09,165
<i>But there are things you want</i>
<i>to forget, and just can't.</i>

366
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:11,374
Nice and cold beer.

367
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,082
Can I ask you something?

368
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:18,124
-Ask.
-You're not going to get mad.

369
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,582
Where did you get the money
to buy this car?

370
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,124
Are you back in business
whit your cousin?

371
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,124
I told you I own
a carpenter shop.

372
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,332
Don't lie to me, João.

373
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:34,665
<i>There always a moment in your life</i>
<i>when we have to tell the truth.</i>

374
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,124
This car is borrowed.

375
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:43,124
Let's dance.

376
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,540
<i>Or life itself</i>
<i>will tell the truth.</i>

377
00:50:50,958 --> 00:51:00,082
<i>It's not our fault</i>
<i>We were born blessed</i>

378
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,915
-What's up, João?
-Were you waiting for me?

379
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:10,457
<i>For the bad distribution</i>

380
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,957
<i>With so many richness out there</i>
<i>Where is it?</i>

381
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:20,957
<i>Where's its share?</i>

382
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:27,374
<i>With so many richness out there</i>
<i>Where is it?</i>

383
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:31,415
<i>Where is it's share?</i>

384
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,957
<i>Wait until when</i>

385
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:40,374
If you want, I'll stop it.
I swear, I'll stop.

386
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,207
But I'm making money.

387
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:47,874
Don't you smoke?
Don't your buddies smoke?

388
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,290
What the fuck, João?

389
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,832
You lied to me,
you swore!

390
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:57,957
I don't want it for me.

391
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:01,582
I don't.

392
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,790
You left harvest aside this week.

393
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:54,874
Are you leaving the weed
to the bugs?

394
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,999
This is all wrong, Pablo.

395
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:09,790
Wrong?

396
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:15,082
But you have a house,
a fridge, a stove.

397
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,790
I think you're doing fine.

398
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:18,915
Nothing's going fine.

399
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,874
I'll start to work on my own.

400
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:25,957
Work?

401
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,374
How are you gonna work?

402
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,290
You're form Santo Cristo.

403
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,082
You're black, you're poor, you're
illiterate. Here, you're shit.

404
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:45,790
I'm out.

405
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:55,832
Ungrateful.

406
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:05,915
I'm here to be your partner.

407
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,874
I wanna talk with you.

408
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:32,999
What is it?

409
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:37,374
This is João, dad.
he's a friend of Beto.

410
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:42,707
But he's on his way, aren't you?
Beto isn't here.

411
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,790
Bye.

412
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:52,124
My dear, what did that man want?

413
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:54,124
He was looking for Beto.

414
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:56,124
You are not some sort of
trouble, are you?

415
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:57,790
Just because he's black?

416
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:03,707
<i>Watch your mouth, young lady!</i>
<i>There¤s a limit for everything!</i>

417
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:11,374
What are you doing?

418
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:17,957
I'm not dealing anymore.

419
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,624
Now I'm a partner in the shop.

420
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:24,874
Again?

421
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,707
I want to do things right,
Maria Lúcia.

422
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:32,082
I want to get married and
have a kid with you.

423
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,624
You go to the living room and ask my
father for his permission to marry me.

424
00:55:41,291 --> 00:55:43,665
Where are you going?

425
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:45,124
-I'll talk to you father.
-You're not going...

426
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,665
Stop it.
You won't talk to him!

427
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,790
You won't talk to him!
Stop it! Stop it!

428
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:56,624
You'll believe me?

429
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:00,165
-I'll talk to your father.
-No, you won't!

430
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:02,165
Enough! Enough!

431
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:06,124
I can't stand it anymore either!
I can't stand it!

432
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:56,790
Hands on your head!

433
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:57,957
Hands on your head, fucker!

434
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,582
Hands on your head!

435
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,582
Now! Hands on your head!
Assume the position!

436
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,082
Look at that!

437
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,624
This is the bastard who's
giving me a hard time.

438
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,790
I told you.

439
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,165
Look.

440
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:47,915
This is the cuffs' little key.

441
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:51,374
I told you.

442
00:57:57,166 --> 00:58:00,832
So, Maria Lúcia's boyfriend.

443
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:03,124
Are you the one who's screwing
up with my business?

444
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:04,624
Are you?

445
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:07,790
Come here.

446
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,624
Does she know you're a dealer?

447
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:16,415
Let him go.

448
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:30,790
Is good enough, Santo?

449
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,790
Did you understand who's boss here?

450
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,832
Shit.

451
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:38,707
Come here, come here.
Do you wanna fuck this nigger's ass?

452
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:43,999
Nigger!

453
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,374
DISCO

454
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,124
What a lame party
you brought us, bro!

455
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:33,374
Telmo! Holy fuck.

456
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:34,790
What are we gonna
do now, Jeremias?

457
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,624
Let's go to my house.
Come on, Telmo.

458
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:39,915
Let's go, Telmo.

459
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:43,374
Goddamn.

460
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:45,915
Let's go!

461
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:08,665
<i>There are things that life</i>
<i>imposes to you.</i>

462
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,790
<i>It never asks if you want,</i>
<i>it throws you there.</i>

463
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:16,957
<i>And then, it's up to you.</i>

464
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:46,040
You're smoking too much.
Holy fuck.

465
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,374
The bastard blew up
my friend's head.

466
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,832
-Yeah, that's right.
-So, what now?

467
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:51,832
-You're a bunch of assholes.
-Assholes?

468
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,374
Yes, assholes. I gave you
the guy on a silver platter.

469
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,457
You should've killed him.
I'd disappear with the corpse.

470
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,415
Game over, Jeremias.

471
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:01,874
I'm out of this shit.

472
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:05,790
You're out my ass, baby.

473
01:02:06,666 --> 01:02:09,790
Come on, let's not go crazy.
Let's not go crazy.

474
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:14,374
-Do you want to be my partner?
-What do you mean, "partner"?

475
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:23,374
¤0¤?

476
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:25,374
I'm leaving.

477
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,290
If you them over,
that's fine.

478
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:09,790
Fuck.

479
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,124
Won't you say anything?

480
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,707
You disappeared, never
showed up again.

481
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,207
It says you who sought me out.

482
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:28,207
What's going on, João?

483
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:37,415
You'd better go.

484
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,582
This is a dangerous place.

485
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,540
What's up, Santo Cristo?
You've been hiding, huh?

486
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,582
-Fuck off, playboy.
-Come on, man.

487
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:25,957
I need some good weed.

488
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:27,999
For you there is no more.

489
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:33,290
Look this shit comes from aboard.

490
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:34,415
It's worth a bundle.

491
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,957
This is great, Santo Cristo.

492
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,915
Will you show up at the
Rockweed party tonight?

493
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,415
Don't you know about that?

494
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:45,957
Jeremias is putting it together.

495
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:50,624
Here. It would be nice
if you showed up.

496
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:53,207
If not, at least you can
roll up that shit.

497
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,207
-It's done.
-Watch my jacket, you junkie.

498
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,165
Sorry.
The invitation's delivered.

499
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:40,915
-How did it go?
-I had to give the bastard my watch.

500
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:43,874
-Did you give anything else?
-That was all.

501
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:47,124
Here, Beto. This is what
you want, right, Beto?

502
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:51,957
-I'm not giving it to you.
-Don't do that, man.

503
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:54,124
What? Here...

504
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:56,999
Here you are.

505
01:06:57,125 --> 01:07:01,040
Behave, okay?
I'm watching you.

506
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:16,957
<i>João.</i>

507
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:22,332
-Maria Lúcia is here?
-No, she is at home.

508
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:24,832
Hey, look that!

509
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:25,915
Run away.

510
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:28,790
-Beat it.
-Are you mad?

511
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:31,957
Son of a bitch!

512
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:41,790
Son of a bitch.

513
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,957
Hey, faggot!
Can you sit yet?

514
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,332
You won't be able to sit anymore.

515
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:12,540
Because I'm gonna blow up
your ass, motherfucker.

516
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,374
Lower your weapons!
Lower them!

517
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,749
Come on, motherfucker.

518
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,915
-What's going on, Pablo?
-What the fuck is this?

519
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:35,332
-Lower your weapons!
-Lower them now!

520
01:08:45,916 --> 01:08:48,415
This is my Rockweed, nigger!

521
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:52,832
<i>Motherfucker.</i>

522
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,915
Scram.

523
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:01,332
-Be strong, Pablo.
-The party is over, herma¤o.

524
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:04,457
I came for the nigger.
Drop the gun and get out.

525
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,957
I owe you one, cousin.

526
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:45,957
Why did you come here?

527
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,749
I don't wanna lose you.

528
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,165
I don't deserve this, João.

529
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,165
Who did this?

530
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:34,707
With you.

531
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,124
Get out of my house, you thug!
Get out of my house.

532
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,957
-Get out of my house.
-Wait a minute.

533
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:55,832
-Calm down, dad.
-What do you mean, calm down?

534
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:58,957
-I love your daughter.
-Love my ass, motherfucker!

535
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:08,040
Come on, João, getaway.

536
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,207
Get out of the car.
Hands on your head.

537
01:13:20,166 --> 01:13:21,749
I want you out of my house.

538
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:37,749
That's the one, sir.
The sun-tanned one.

539
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,082
João de Santo Cristo,
the Ceilândia killer.

540
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:44,832
He won't be missed.

541
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,165
Look, there will be no
killing in my precinct...

542
01:13:50,333 --> 01:13:52,249
but if you wanna teach him
a lesson...

543
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,707
Is the police doing that to you?

544
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:51,749
If is not the police, who is?

545
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:57,915
Talk!

546
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:09,665
Forget about it.

547
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,457
Don't come back here, anymore.

548
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,207
Tell me, João.

549
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:57,582
Hey, were you looking for me?
Okay, spit it out! Shoot.

550
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,165
-It's about João.
-Who?

551
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:03,415
-João.
-João? What João?

552
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,415
There are lots of them
in this town.

553
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,415
-Santo Cristo.
-Oh, Santo Cristo, yeah.

554
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:12,582
He's having a good time in jail,
isn't he? Tell me.

555
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,540
I'm here to ask you
a favor.

556
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,707
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

557
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:22,457
You'd like me to help
you out, right?

558
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:25,582
You came here all dressed up
to ask me for a favor.

559
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:27,332
Is that right? Tell me. What about the
cock-teasing you threw my away...

560
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,624
all my life?
Isn't it enough?

561
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:32,624
"I don't date dealers. I'm a
decent girl." Fuck yourself!

562
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,832
Now, you humiliate me, hooking
up with a two-bit-dealer.

563
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:39,415
-It is about me?
-Yes, it's about you!

564
01:16:41,416 --> 01:16:42,915
I want you for myself.

565
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:51,540
Help me.

566
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:55,332
Please.

567
01:16:58,541 --> 01:16:59,582
Okay.

568
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:01,749
I'll help you.

569
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:05,540
When you visit hi m next. I
promise he'll be feeling better.

570
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:08,540
Okay?

571
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,915
He said he doesn't want
to see you.

572
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,415
-How come?
-He just doesn't.

573
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:50,665
But I want to see him.

574
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:58,457
Get in.

575
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:00,165
Come in.

576
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:03,165
You're looking beautiful,
beautiful.

577
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,290
Come on, motherfucker,
get up.

578
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:19,749
Get up, Santo Cristo,
I'm talking to you.

579
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,207
Come here.

580
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,249
Hold the newspaper here.

581
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,207
-What for?
-Shut up and keep it still.

582
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,374
That's it. One hand here,
the other one here...

583
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:44,249
You're so fucking smart.
Here, that's it.

584
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:59,290
Son of a bitch.

585
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,290
Get up, fucker.

586
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:35,124
-They came out great.
-Very good.

587
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,999
You're looking great in this one.

588
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:56,957
João de Santo Cristo. Today,
there's no photo shoot.

589
01:22:56,958 --> 01:23:01,165
I brought you a present,
to keep you entertained.

590
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:04,165
Okay?
I'll see you next week.

591
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:11,082
Hey, baby, out the shirt on.
I don't have the whole for this.

592
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:28,999
Good looking guy.

593
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:36,332
-Can I read it?
-You're illiterate.

594
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,832
Let go.

595
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,957
Keep looking at the
picture I gave you.

596
01:24:44,791 --> 01:24:47,207
Hey, what are you doing?

597
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:50,207
Open the door!
Open, now!

598
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,165
Wait, wait.

599
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,790
Now, on your knees.

600
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,749
On my knees, my ass,
you nigger, son of a...

601
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,249
<i>Hey, Jeremias!</i>

602
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:37,749
Holy fuck.

603
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:58,165
Calm down, man.

604
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:28,707
Where's the coke?

605
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:38,957
That stupid fool left
the house wide open.

606
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,749
Dudu, buddy.

607
01:29:05,291 --> 01:29:07,749
Fuck it, Dudu.

608
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,749

CEIL¤NDIA
LOT ¤ 14

609
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:15,207
He took all my coke.

610
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:21,915
He took it all. Fuck!
He took my coke!

611
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:24,790
He took my coke.

612
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,999
Let's see who's gonna get
fucked over there.

613
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:30,749
This is war, now.

614
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:36,665
This is war.

615
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:41,665
He thinks he'll fuck me over.

616
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:44,624
He'll fuck me over?
We shall see.

617
01:29:52,708 --> 01:29:54,749
We shall see who's
gonna get screwed.

618
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,082
It's here.

619
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:30,374
João!

620
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:00,874
Easy...

621
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:43,624
<i>Was it me...</i>

622
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,582
<i>or the destiny?</i>

623
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:54,207
<i>What if I had done it</i>
<i>differently?</i>

624
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:58,582
<i>Would it change my path?</i>

625
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:01,874
<i>Would my dreams became fate?</i>

626
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:10,540
<i>The end is not where</i>
<i>the road ends.</i>
