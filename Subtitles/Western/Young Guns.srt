1
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:08,044
Now, I say we stop off at Juan Petrón's
for one jolly big dram

2
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,129
and one ginger beer with cream.

3
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:14,467
- Who gets the whisky?
- The one closest to the coffin.

4
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:20,097
Anyway, if I buy you a dram, you must
promise not to tell the other boys.

5
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,766
It's a promise.

6
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,601
(gunshot)

7
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,153
Oh, no. Not another hanging.

8
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,553
Shit.

9
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,189
- Howdy.
- (man) Come on, lad.

10
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,069
Hurry up. Don't be afraid.

11
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,191
- You want to play games?
- Red-assed Mexican.

12
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,819
You do it with your horse!

13
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,323
- Mexican greaser!
- White chickenshit!

14
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,327
- Come on, greaser. Cut me down!
- Hey, knock it off! Knock it off!

15
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,413
Cut me down, Mexican!
Cut me down, Mexican!

16
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,749
Knock it off.
You know better, Chavez.

17
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,960
- Navajo! Navajo!
- That's enough!

18
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,674
John's back. Wash up,
and into supper clothes.

19
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,093
Now! Both of you!

20
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,356
- Who are them?
- "They", William. "Who are they?"

21
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,400
They are the boys of the dregs.

22
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:41,781
The flotsam and jetsam
of frontier society, if you will.

23
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,575
We've got room in the bunkhouse,
my young man.

24
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,035
If you don't want to stay,

25
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,956
the Santa Fe runs out of Albuquerque
in the morning.

26
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,958
Glad you're back, Doc.

27
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,377
Start hauling the rope inside.

28
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,212
John bring another hard case in?

29
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,548
- Hope it ain't another Mexican.
- Mexican-lndian.

30
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,761
If you do wish to stay,
we have just the job for you.

31
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,389
- (grunts)
- Argh!

32
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,896
- He ain't all there, is he?
- You son of a bitch!

33
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,829
(laughs)

34
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:33,833
Hey, did you know pigs
is as smart as dogs?

35
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,753
Yeah, it's true.
I knew a fella in El Capitan,

36
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,756
taught his pig to bark at strangers.

37
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,553
What you doin' here, boy?

38
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,432
We work for Mr Tunstall
as regulators.

39
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:59,608
Mr Tunstall's got a soft spot
for runaways, derelicts, vagrant types.

40
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,194
But you can't be any geek off the street.

41
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,657
Got to be handy with the steel.
Earn your keep.

42
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,784
Go on, go on, get!

43
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:15,124
Not that I'm a pistoleer or a knifesmith
like that greaser Chavez Chavez.

44
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,878
I'm a pugilist. (laughs)

45
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,632
But then, I ain't expectin' you
to know that word, hog boy!

46
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,634
(oinks)

47
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,804
- You don't even know why I'm here.
- Sure I do.

48
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,475
You're a runaway,
derelict vagrant like the rest of us.

49
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,480
Footpad, maybe? Petty thief?
Rob a bank? Kill somebody?

50
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,359
Killed somebody, huh?

51
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,322
(man) Regulators!

52
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:50,868
You ain't no regulator! Stay here with
the pork. You might learn something.

53
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:55,081
Cattle look spooked in the lower 40.
Let's take a look.

54
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,500
Smart ass.

55
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,716
Well, now.
Look at those appetites, hm?

56
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,097
William. Have some more.

57
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,562
You ever worked beef before, Billy?

58
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,112
Did the chow line.

59
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,823
But, uh, I got a way with cattle.

60
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,700
(laughter)

61
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,873
What's so jolly funny,
Master Steven?

62
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,918
That's no proper table manners.

63
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,047
Got a way with hogs. (oinks)

64
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,884
Congratulations, Charles.

65
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:53,013
You and Steven
will do the dirty crockery alone.

66
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,643
Sorry, John. Struck me funny.

67
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,146
And to William. Both of you.

68
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,068
Apologies, William.
Just hackin' on you, that's all.

69
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,488
Yeah, we was just hackin' on you.

70
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,749
Rumour has it you killed a man, Billy.
You don't seem like the killing sort.

71
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,002
Yeah, Billy, what you kill him for?

72
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,924
He was hackin' on me.

73
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,010
(gulps)

74
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,309
"There are...

75
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,478
plenty of men...

76
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,274
who will never secede..."

77
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,984
Succeed.

78
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,781
Suc..."...who will never
succeed anywhere."

79
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,993
Got a whole roomful of 'em right here.

80
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,206
Well done.

81
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,876
William.

82
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,469
- Yeah, sure.
- (John) Well, excuse me, Billy.

83
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,889
Very sorry to offend you.

84
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,351
But we're congregated here
to learn to read and write.

85
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:25,022
You need more than skill with a firearm
to succeed in the New World, Billy.

86
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:30,152
So take up the journal
and start where the other boy left off,

87
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:35,157
or you can go straight back
to your home on the streets.

88
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,331
"Young men who don't know
how to do any kind of business

89
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,667
and have no energy or application

90
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:49,046
had better stay at home near their
relatives so they can be taken care of."

91
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,007
"They are not wanted here
and will only come to grief."

92
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:57,096
"But men of enterprise
are practically sure of success."

93
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,391
Splendid.

94
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,644
A splendid reading, William.

95
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,730
Thank you.
Good night, gentlemen.

96
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,441
(all) Good night, Mr Tunstall.

97
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,334
(horse whinnies)

98
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,970
(grunting)

99
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,640
Shit.

100
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,727
Whoa! Son of a bitch!

101
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,124
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Afternoon, John.

102
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,834
Mr Dolan and Mr Murphy here

103
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,588
are complainin' about their
merchandise wagon being plundered

104
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,091
on several occasions
on the way into town.

105
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,093
They think you're behind it.

106
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,306
- That's a fargin' lie, and you know it!
- Richard.

107
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,809
Sheriff Brady.

108
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,484
Until I'm pronounced a thief
and shaken out of Lincoln.

109
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,111
I've never touched his property.

110
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,364
I have no cause.

111
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,492
Well!

112
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,411
The belted earl has spoken.

113
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:49,458
Look behind you, Earl.
All I see are hired thieves.

114
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,295
(John) These boys are promising
young men acquiring an education.

115
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,632
I've had you pegged as the type that...

116
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,801
that likes...

117
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:04,348
- educatin' young boys, Englishman.
- (laughter)

118
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,686
Tunstall.

119
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:15,317
Rumour has it you're bidding against
me for the government beef contracts.

120
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,320
It is just rumour, isn't it?

121
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:23,158
Lawrence, you have a beef outfit
and a store.

122
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,869
I have a beef outfit and a store.

123
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,164
We're both going to try to make money.

124
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,625
It's simple, and it's fair.

125
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,173
You see our good sheriff
sittin' on that horse?

126
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,510
Do you know how much money
he's got invested in my store?

127
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,680
His life savings, John.

128
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:49,101
It's not just Brady who wants me
to get those contracts.

129
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,855
It's the territorial district attorney,
the chief justice,

130
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,904
This is a family thing, John.

131
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:06,952
Don't come prancin' in with your fat,
foreign capital, tryin' to change things.

132
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:11,540
I made a very long steamship journey
from London, Mr Murphy,

133
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:18,088
so I shall be damned if I'm going to be
dissuaded by political corruption.

134
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,469
So I'd like you to take your threats and
your sheriff and get off my property.

135
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,722
You're ambitious, Earl.

136
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,393
But you'd be better off selling
ladies' undergarments in Hampstead.

137
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,395
(laughter)

138
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,983
All right, men, that's enough.
Put 'em away.

139
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,654
This is a new country. We won't
bow down to you no more, Englishman.

140
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,658
Get ready for hell.

141
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,077
Come on!

142
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,375
Back to work, chaps.

143
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,829
Mr Tunstall?
My name's J McCloskey.

144
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,499
I heard you're having
some trouble finding help.

145
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,293
McCloskey?
You're one of Murphy's boys.

146
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,005
Used to be. He fired me.

147
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,675
I called him a fat sow.

148
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,760
Did you?

149
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,846
Lovely.

150
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,266
Bunkhouse is over there.

151
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,911
- (gunshots)
- Get down!

152
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,292
(laughs)

153
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,840
Regulators!

154
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,970
Let's dance.

155
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,056
(? Jig)

156
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,471
- Look at Billy Bonney go.
- He ain't all there, is he?

157
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:06,525
He's there enough to be dancin'
while we pull our tallywhackers.

158
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,777
Damn straight.

159
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,030
Come on.

160
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:17,202
We have to expose this ring, Alex.
Can you get me in to see the governor?

161
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,955
Murphy's beat us to it,

162
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,625
and he brought the governor
a nice, fat campaign contribution.

163
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,838
They're tightening the yoke, John.
They want me out, too.

164
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,883
With me gone, no lawyer would be
crazy enough to represent you.

165
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,178
You've heard of English tenacity,
haven't you?

166
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,349
Here's to enough grit
to finish the last round.

167
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,941
Besides, if we gave in and left,

168
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,194
who'd look after my boys?

169
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,239
- Oh, uh, medicine.
- Oh.

170
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:59,035
Yes, I shall receive my degree
from St Michael's in July,

171
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:04,833
and then I shall practise here in Lincoln
until my missionary to the islands.

172
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,626
Isn't that nice?

173
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,740
Howdy. My name's Doc.

174
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:39,910
(Murphy) What can I do for you,
young man?

175
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,579
If you're an acquaintance
of the young miss,

176
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,043
Why, certainly.

177
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,504
Thank you.

178
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,932
- What's your name?
- Yen Sun.

179
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,059
That's beautiful.

180
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,313
You're a friend of Mr Murphy's?

181
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,775
- He is my guardian.
- Oh.

182
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,744
- Hello, there.
- Hello back.

183
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,746
William Bonney, sir.

184
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,499
Pat Garrett. Pleasure.

185
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,837
Excuse us, friend.
We have a request for the band.

186
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,384
Pat Garrett.

187
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,435
I'll bet I get to be just as big as him.

188
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,606
Nah...

189
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,608
bigger.

190
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,322
"So shows the snowy dove
trooping with crows,

191
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,534
as yonder lady
o'er her fellows shows."

192
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,204
- Pardon me?
- Oh.

193
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,331
That's a poem.

194
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,043
I'm a poet. I wrote it.

195
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,630
I'm sorry, young man,
but we must be gettin' along.

196
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,674
We're getting along famously.

197
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,721
You're part of the Tunstall company.

198
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,890
- (Doc) Yes, I am.
- Ah.

199
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:31,313
Then I'll be expectin' to see you follow
your Englishman out of Lincoln.

200
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:37,903
You tell him... Tell that slug to leave
no slime on the road behind him

201
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:41,072
when he crawls back
to Wharf Street.

202
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,663
- (woman) OK, Doc.
- Hey!

203
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,708
Alex! How ya doin'?

204
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:56,713
- Someone break up your dance?
- Yeah. He's the girl's guardian.

205
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:01,343
- Guardian? That's a gentle euphemism.
- Why?

206
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,596
He had a shirt ruined
in a Silver City laundry.

207
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,308
He took the Celestial woman's
daughter as payment.

208
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,729
- What?
- She's house entertainment.

209
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,067
- You can dance with Susan. It's safer.
- Yeah.

210
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,362
Yeah.

211
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,048
- Out of the way, mister.
- I do beg your pardon.

212
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,300
- Come on. You and me.
- No, no, no.

213
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,719
No, it's you and I.

214
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:50,684
- Isn't that right, John? You and I?
- Yes, yes, it is.

215
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,900
You... and I.

216
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,971
- Pugilist.
- He's somethin'.

217
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,973
Happy New Year!

218
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,266
(cheering)

219
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,065
Happy New Year!

220
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,534
? And never brought to mind?

221
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:55,165
? Should auld acquaintance be forgot

222
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:00,670
? And days of auld lang syne?

223
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:05,508
? For auld lang syne...

224
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:11,347
? Should auld acquaintance be forgot

225
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:27,739
? For the sake of auld lang syne?

226
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:33,078
? For auld lang syne, my friend...

227
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,335
(whooping)

228
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,095
Go on, Billy. Boys will be boys.

229
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,098
Hah!

230
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,724
Woo-hoo!

231
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,810
Woo-hoo-hoo!

232
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:00,522
Hah! Hah!

233
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,007
No, no! There's too many!

234
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,428
Get out of here!

235
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,615
"For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God in his wise providence

236
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,411
to take out of this world
the soul of our deceased brother,

237
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,914
we therefore commit
his body to the ground."

238
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,418
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

239
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,590
Murphy's henchmen
have to be brought in.

240
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,968
I'm going to take it to court
and bring Murphy down.

241
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,971
Have you talked to Sheriff Brady?

242
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,643
You're the justice of the peace.

243
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,646
You can serve warrants
through special constables.

244
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:29,903
What special constables? No one's fool
enough to go after Murphy's people.

245
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,780
Deputise them.

246
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,658
Those are just boys.
Ain't one of 'em over 21.

247
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:39,162
- Murphy's men will shred 'em in half.
- Will you deputise them?

248
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,707
Hell, no. No, I won't, Alex.

249
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,212
Not me.

250
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,298
All right, then. You go tell 'em.

251
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,316
(shouting)

252
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,877
Lugar peligroso.

253
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,422
- Bad medicine, my friends.
- You got that right.

254
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:35,718
- You grew up in a hole worse than that.
- Yeah, but I've been cultured since.

255
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,722
OK. Henry Hill's been in there
with a lady since noon.

256
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,934
We'll show him the warrant,
take him home.

257
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,937
Yeah. Yeah. We gotta take him.

258
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,690
I'd say we do.

259
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,112
Hey, uh, Billy?

260
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:57,657
Why don't you go inside
and have a look-see?

261
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,249
Go on, Billy. See if Hill's in there.
If he is, bring him to us.

262
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:29,230
(man) Yeah, give me two cards.

263
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,322
- I'll take two.
- Hey, Hill, want another drink?

264
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,117
Got to drain it first.
I'll have Janey here give me a hand.

265
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,286
Doc says not to lift nothing too heavy.

266
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,793
You talk to me like that, Henry Hill.

267
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,054
Now what the hell's he doin'?

268
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,559
Get up.

269
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,735
Ah. Oh, Lord. (grunts)

270
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,988
(passes wind)

271
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,826
- Henry Hill?
- Yeah?

272
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,122
Howdy.

273
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,003
Oh, God.

274
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,713
Shit!

275
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,471
- By the way, you're under arrest.
- (gunshots)

276
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,728
Shit!

277
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,118
Oh, shit!

278
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,023
Bonney! You weren't supposed
to smoke anybody!

279
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,651
We got warrants! We're the law!

280
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:44,031
(laughs)

281
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,701
(Doc) "Nine men lay dead
or at death's door

282
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,204
following a gunfight
between Henry Hill, 45,

283
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,582
and what patrons called a kid."

284
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:55,710
"A local miner identified the kid
as one Henry McCarty,

285
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,297
also known as William H Bonney,
19 or 20."

286
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:04,552
"The kid, Billy, killed Mr Hill, then took
on an onslaught of Hill partisans,

287
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,597
bringing the damage
to six verified slayings."

288
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:11,309
"Bonney is believed to be captain
of a deputised gang."

289
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,935
Captain?

290
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,064
How come it don't say nothin'
about the two I got?

291
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,237
El Chivato. Billy the Kid, huh?

292
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,783
(boy) Murphy's going to want blood,
brains and balls for this.

293
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,911
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey, Doc.

294
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,164
Don't be stupid.
You know they'll be looking for us.

295
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,667
Yeah, I know.
I'll be back in one minute.

296
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,882
Howdy.

297
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:48,012
- I cannot accept those. Thank you.
- You walk awful fast for a little thing.

298
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,264
Come on, Yen, I just want to talk.

299
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,976
- You must like trouble.
- You think I look like trouble?

300
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,646
I'm a poet carrying flowers,
of all things.

301
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,648
And a gun. It's a big gun.

302
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:02,276
It's a big town.
Come on, Yen, please.

303
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,864
Stop!

304
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,662
Look. If you don't want to take these,
that's fine.

305
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,956
But you take a message
to your guardian.

306
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:21,295
You tell LG Murphy
the regulators are going to clean house.

307
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:27,802
They can't own us like they own
a little China girl for the price of a shirt.

308
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,680
You tell him that.

309
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,061
Yen, I'm sorry.

310
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,202
So, Dick...

311
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,497
who's next?

312
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,083
You.

313
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,931
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

314
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,226
I mean I found some. Horseshit.

315
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:20,271
They come down
from the Sierra Bonitas this morning.

316
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:26,277
Horses been grazin' wild. Pretty damn
good, don't you think, Baker?

317
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,954
Not that good.

318
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,707
- Buenos dias, shitheads.
- Up.

319
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,752
By killing Henry Hill,
you started a war.

320
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,213
By killing Mr Tunstall,
y'all started the damn war.

321
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,718
Just the same, we're talking 50, 60 men
against your... what? Six or seven?

322
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:55,097
- We're with the ring, Dick.
- We're going to bury you.

323
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,392
Quiet, Bonney.
We're taking you to jail. No killing.

324
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,645
Objection, Your Honour.

325
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,481
These boys are going to the grave.

326
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:07,735
I said quiet! I don't need that kind
of talk. The law don't talk like that.

327
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,238
- The law don't kill innocent merchants.
- Shut up, dirt face.

328
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,327
Uh-huh!

329
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,789
Hey, Billy, easy.

330
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:25,711
Dick, we shouldn't go
by way of South Fork.

331
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,758
- Why's that?
- I think Murphy will ambush us there.

332
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,940
Hey.

333
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,527
- What?
- I saw that.

334
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,779
What? What did you see?

335
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,783
- He knows what I just saw!
- What you talkin' about?

336
00:33:55,784 --> 00:34:00,830
Where's the ambush? In Lincoln?
You're steering us away from Capitan

337
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:04,709
cos your men - Murphy's men -
are waiting to jump us in Lincoln.

338
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:08,504
Billy, McCloskey's with us.
He's a regulator.

339
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,007
- He used to ride with Murphy!
- That was a long time ago.

340
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,010
- He's a spy!
- He's been with us. We made a pact.

341
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,680
- Right, McCloskey?
- Right.

342
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,974
Jesus, Billy.

343
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,355
Come on.

344
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,494
Ah, shit. I'm sorry, McCloskey.

345
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,080
It's all right.
We're all upset about John.

346
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,833
I'm sorry I didn't
sniff you out sooner, traitor!

347
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,959
(Richard) Billy!

348
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,505
- Oh, shit!
- Billy!

349
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,175
Billy, what the hell...? Jesus!

350
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,897
Hold your fire!

351
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,524
- Halt!
- Shit!

352
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,277
No!

353
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,117
- Hold your goddamn fire!
- Get that son of a bitch!

354
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,247
Oh, God!

355
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:34,882
- Court adjourned.
- Moron! You're out of line!

356
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,552
He was right.
McCloskey was acting strange.

357
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,722
Then we just killed
three more Murphy men! Right?

358
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,390
- Right.
- Oh, Christ!

359
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,602
- Brady's going to hang us for sure!
- What do we do now?

360
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:51,899
Everybody close their fargin' lips
for a second and let me think!

361
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,276
We better skin out of here.

362
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:59,406
OK, everybody,
skin up the river. Now!

363
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,579
You! You better stop
believing the newspapers.

364
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,000
You ain't no captain, and you sure
as hell ain't no Robin Hood.

365
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,670
Whatever you say, Dick.

366
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,798
Get that idiot on a horse.

367
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,466
Hah!

368
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:56,630
"Advices from Lincoln say the young
lad of iron nerve and marvellous skill

369
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:04,805
including a miraculous
shot of 50 yards."

370
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:10,978
There's a picture here.
It says "Billy the Kid" but it ain't Billy.

371
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,480
Let me see that.

372
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,067
Well, that's me.

373
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:22,615
That's bullshit.
Papers can't get anything right.

374
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,538
"Sources say that the kid,
a left-hander, is tall, handsome,

375
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:33,208
and unequalled in the elements
that appeal to the holier emotions."

376
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,878
Jesus, this country needs a hero!

377
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:41,508
"Murphy has hired none other than
John Kinney and his Doña Ana bunch

378
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,428
to hunt down Billy the Kid
and the gang."

379
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,889
Oh, great. John Kinney.

380
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,849
Who's Kinney?

381
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,518
(Doc) It says he's an ex-soldier
who suffered an injury

382
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,687
and is now a bounty hunter.

383
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:58,150
- What's that mean?
- It means he can whoop some ass.

384
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,919
- Hey, Doc. Come here for a minute?
- Yeah.

385
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,887
(Charles) Read the rest.

386
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,265
- What's up?
- We can't go north.

387
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:48,575
We can go through the Valley of Fires,
but there's the Mescalero reservation.

388
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,913
They're having a good year with scalps.
I don't think so.

389
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:56,250
I don't know what the hell to do.

390
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,585
What the hell's he doin'?

391
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,762
We've come to a place
where we are lost.

392
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:12,599
When an Indian is lost, he reaches
into the spirit world to find the way.

393
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,276
We're lost right now,
but I'll find us the way.

394
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:28,032
Oh, Christ! That's all we need,
more red-ass Navajo mambojahambo.

395
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,493
We're running out of time here, Chavez.

396
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,959
Is that any good?

397
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,464
Chavez, what is that?

398
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,841
Peyote.

399
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,067
Dick?

400
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,009
(Doc) Butterflies.

401
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,556
Yeah.

402
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,975
Just like a butterfly.

403
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:43,607
Butterfly flies to a flower,

404
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,859
stays with it.

405
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,073
It doesn't know why,

406
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,242
it just feels it.

407
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,787
Oh, yeah.

408
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,748
She's...

409
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,757
She's my flower.

410
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,593
I'm her...

411
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,595
(gunshot)

412
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:19,393
Did you guys see the size
of that chicken?

413
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:24,940
Oh.

414
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,923
We don't know why.

415
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,301
We just feel it.

416
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,636
(gunshot)

417
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,306
(Steve) Oh, God!

418
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,225
You guys! You guys!

419
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,200
Wow.

420
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,661
This is great.

421
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,414
This is great!

422
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:29,796
Did you see the size of that
cock-a-doodle-goddamned-do?

423
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,146
That's real. That's real!

424
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,951
I'm her butterfly. She's mine!

425
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:04,998
- (Richard) Regulators, saddle up!
- (war cry)

426
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,252
Godless heathens.

427
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,962
(war cry)

428
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:17,094
Regulators!

429
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,063
Hey, Doc, Doc!

430
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,400
Did you see the size
of that chicken?

431
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,280
? Gather 'round the coal house, babe

432
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,741
? Two hands 'round and go again

433
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:44,371
? Allemande left
and a turn to your partner

434
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,790
Howdy.

435
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,711
How are you, sir?

436
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,552
Hey, Chavez,
how come they ain't killin' us?

437
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:04,599
Cos we're in the spirit world,
asshole! They can't see us!

438
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:08,520
? There's the girl
with the golden hair...

439
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,196
Hey, did you know
we're in the spirit world?

440
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:44,598
(Richard) Lord, forgive us
for our wrongdoings,

441
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,435
for our misguidance
by heathen religions.

442
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,272
Thank you for keeping us alive.

443
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:58,278
Please guide us
in doing the right thing.

444
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,783
Oh! Ow!

445
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,827
Our Father, who art in heaven,

446
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,124
Please, Dick, it's getting cold!

447
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,962
I could've killed you, Dick.

448
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:22,511
I could've killed you...
but I don't want to kill you. I want to eat.

449
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:25,180
When we've finished this meal,
you rodent,

450
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:29,309
we're going outside to see
who has the right to run the regulators.

451
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:34,564
Richard, would you be so kind
as to pass the gravy, please?

452
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:38,485
- Mighty well-heeled man coming.
- Just one?

453
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,490
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, Lord, it's Buckshot Roberts!

454
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,537
- We got a warrant for him.
- Is he coming to surrender?

455
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:53,250
- Don't look that way.
- (Billy) He any good?

456
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,546
He's killed more people
than smallpox.

457
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,262
Well, hell, introduce us.

458
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,370
We got a warrant for you, old man.

459
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:35,375
I ain't got no business with that war
no more, peckerhead son of a bitch.

460
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:41,381
I'm on my own. I'm here to get that $150
Sheriff Brady's putting down for the kid.

461
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:45,302
The rest of you little shits
is only worth 110, but I'll take it.

462
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:48,054
What a sweet disposition.

463
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:52,142
Let's dance.

464
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,107
(screams)

465
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,109
Chavez!

466
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,658
Argh! Ah, shit!

467
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,494
Damn.

468
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,330
(groans)

469
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,500
Chavez?

470
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,710
What?

471
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,924
- (Roberts) You little sons of bitches!
- Go into the shitter.

472
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:28,094
- What?
- Billy, go in there and cut him in half.

473
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,893
I'm daring you, Billy.

474
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,235
(Roberts) Y'all can't blast me!

475
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,449
Screw that!

476
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,968
(groaning)

477
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,478
Cover me.

478
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,121
Dick!

479
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:47,382
Son of a bitch!
Dick, we're coming to get you!

480
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,385
He's dead, Charley.

481
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,430
We got to go get him!
We got to go get him!

482
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:56,516
You want to cross
in front of that shithouse again?

483
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,603
What are we gonna do?
Dick got his guts blown out!

484
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:03,356
- He's our foreman!
- Come on.

485
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:08,903
- Doc, what are we going to do?
- Get the hell out of here!

486
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,072
Come on, Charley!

487
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:14,576
Regulators! Let's rack out now!

488
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,287
OK!

489
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,818
- Where to, Doc?
- I'm going into Patricio if it looks safe.

490
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:34,781
I'll write Dick's mother in Vermont,
get some clean wraps for this.

491
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,534
Well, whatever you do,
don't go near Lincoln.

492
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,786
See you.

493
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,728
What you doin' there, Billy?

494
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,313
Well, sir,

495
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,691
with the sight filed down,

496
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:14,654
I got an eighth-of-a-second drop
on our good Sheriff Brady.

497
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,614
(gunshot)

498
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:23,204
Billy, we can't touch the sheriff.
Dick said so. You know that.

499
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,915
Besides, we can't keep this up.

500
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,003
Well, Dick ain't around any more,
is he, Charley?

501
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,381
Brady's in desperate need
of being removed from office.

502
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:36,384
We're not going after Brady.

503
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:39,721
No Murphy men. No more.

504
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,557
I told you I would find the way,
and the way is west.

505
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,351
West, huh?

506
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,354
West is that way,

507
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,232
and the bastards we got to kill
are that way.

508
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,903
The only bastards going to get killed
are us, Chivato. Let it go.

509
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:59,282
Let it go? Murphy's taking inventory
in Tunstall's store right now!

510
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,951
That means nothing to you?

511
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,250
It means nothing to me?

512
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:15,256
Murphy and his politicians
have taken more blood from me

513
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,217
than they ever will from you.

514
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,552
Oh, yeah?
How do you figure?

515
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,931
The Red Sand Creek Reservation.

516
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,100
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

517
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,567
My mother's people.

518
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,239
Murphy and Company was under
contract to supply us with beef.

519
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:42,909
Two winters ago,
he sent only rotten meat.

520
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,579
No corn, no flour, only rancid beef
crawling with worms.

521
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,250
So I went out with a band
to a trader's camp to try and get food.

522
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:54,838
Oh, yeah, they welcomed us in,
and then they opened fire on us.

523
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,257
I got away - only me!

524
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:01,761
But when I got back to the Red Sands,

525
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:06,140
I found out that the army had already
heard about our "big Indian uprising".

526
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,101
And they paid us back.

527
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:12,272
My mother was cut by a sabre
from her privates to her neck.

528
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:16,860
My sisters were just babies. They had
their heads bashed in with boot heels

529
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:20,280
so the army could save bullets!

530
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,615
Everybody on my reservation
was butchered.

531
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,285
And it means nothing to me?!

532
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:32,625
Oh, yeah, I went to Lincoln
to take Murphy's head,

533
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,838
and that's when
John Tunstall found me.

534
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:42,510
And he took me in, and he taught me
a better way to bury Murphy.

535
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:46,014
Murphy buried him
the old Irish way, Chavez.

536
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:48,182
That's right, Steve.

537
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,978
And he starved out your family, Chavez.

538
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:56,691
Now he's doing it to every small farmer
in the territory.

539
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,528
But you wanna run, go ahead.
Just go right on ahead.

540
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,032
Bye. You got no loyalty, Navajo.

541
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:05,575
(Steve) Navajo!

542
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:10,246
He ain't nothin' but a piece
of chickenshit in the rain.

543
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,498
No.

544
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,586
We had our ceremony
back there on the ridge, Chivato.

545
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,380
Now, I don't know
what your vision told you,

546
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,760
but mine told me we're headed
for blood, blood like a river.

547
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:28,723
I'm the last of my clan,
the last of my people.

548
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:34,145
If I die, and I'm not afraid of dying,
the sacred hoop is broken.

549
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,693
Now I have to go west
to make my people live again.

550
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,582
Charley...

551
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:57,001
will you come with me?

552
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,219
You ain't sayin' much, Dirty Steve.

553
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,055
Cos he ain't got much to say,
Charley.

554
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:13,559
Old Steve understands the meaning
of the word "pals", don't you, Steve?

555
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:18,773
See, you got three or four good pals,
then you got yourself a tribe.

556
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,401
There ain't nothing
stronger than that.

557
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,779
We're your family now, Chavez.

558
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,575
You walk away from us,
you break our sacred hoop.

559
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,954
We got to stick together, fellas.

560
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,373
That's the only way I see it.

561
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:55,977
? When Irish eyes are smiling

562
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:58,938
? Sure, it's like a morning spring

563
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:02,692
? In the lilt of Irish laughter

564
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,612
? You can hear the angels sing

565
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:19,459
? But when Irish eyes are smiling

566
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,305
Shh! Shh! Shh!

567
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,974
It's me - Doc. OK? Shh!

568
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,481
(laughter)

569
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:47,195
I know you've come to lay with me
then cut me into tiny pieces!

570
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:50,490
You're the bandit
who eats children and old people!

571
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,534
I eat meat and potatoes.
Who told you that?

572
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,412
My benefactor.

573
00:56:56,497 --> 00:57:00,208
Your benefactor?
That's the man that eats people.

574
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:10,176
Yen, if you want to stay here,
tell me now, and I'll go.

575
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,929
Do you want to stay here?

576
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,893
In China, girls are not necessary.
When we have floods,

577
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:23,356
fathers let the girl babies wash by.
My benefactor has made me necessary.

578
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,693
He hasn't made you necessary.
He's made you a slave!

579
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,488
I'm sorry.

580
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:36,911
Necessary is something
you can't do without.

581
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,038
I can't do without you.

582
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:45,878
I keep the flowers that you offered me

583
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:49,715
in a little room inside my head...

584
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,808
Often, I say yes.

585
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,228
I want to ask
something else of you now.

586
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,273
I want you to go with me to Roswell.

587
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,067
There's a railroad
going to New York City.

588
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:13,072
Two days, we could be on a train,
in another country, in a city together.

589
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:21,747
"The Bird", by Josiah G Scurlock.
That's Doc.

590
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,667
"Once upon a midnight dreary,

591
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,253
as I pondered weak and weary,

592
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,674
there came a knocking
at my... back porch."

593
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,304
Ain't very original, is he?

594
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,852
He's been gone an awful long time.

595
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:47,106
I have a feeling
he's gonna be makin' a run for it.

596
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,318
Who? Doc?

597
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,279
Nah, Doc likes me.

598
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:03,623
If I stay, I'll be a stiff in a photograph.
The only chance I have is to run.

599
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:07,001
- They would chase us.
- I'm used to that.

600
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:11,172
No.

601
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,508
I am unclean.
That is not for a young man.

602
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:19,805
Yen, I used to ride with the Dirty
Underwear Gang of Liberty, Missouri.

603
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:24,310
Then John Tunstall taught me
the past is like an old yellow novel.

604
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:30,274
When you're finished with it,
you toss it out and start a new one.

605
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,860
OK?

606
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:42,828
- You're necessary.
- (footsteps)

607
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,331
(knock at door)

608
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,376
- Go with me. Come with me, Yen.
- No.

609
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,211
(Murphy) Yen Sun!

610
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:55,716
Yen Sun!

611
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,677
(keys rattle)

612
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,950
- Hey, Steve!
- What?

613
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:25,496
Doc's back.
I told you he'd come back.

614
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,375
Regulators, let's saddle up!

615
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,921
Sheriff Brady,

616
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:36,132
we're gonna have a lot of fun now.

617
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,436
What the hell's he doin'?

618
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,274
(Steve) He ain't all there, is he?

619
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,736
Is he?

620
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,746
Top o' the mornin' to you, girls. (laughs)

621
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,032
Reap the whirlwind,
Sheriff Brady.

622
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,160
Reap it!

623
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,958
- (Billy) It's for you.
- (Alex) You weren't to touch Brady!

624
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:55,669
Sheriff Brady sent the men
who killed John.

625
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,838
- It was a good move for us.
- It wasn't.

626
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,674
- Yes, it was!
- Have you seen The Independent?

627
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,968
The governor's revoked
your deputisation.

628
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:06,806
You're wanted by the legitimate law
as well as those outside the law.

629
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:10,976
You're being hunted by John Kinney,
Murphy's men, and troops!

630
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,312
Fort Stanton, Billy! The US Army.

631
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:17,316
The governor's put
a $200 bounty on your head.

632
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,695
You were supposed to serve
11 warrants and expose the ring.

633
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,824
Instead, you went on the warpath,
on a rampage.

634
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:27,993
Now Richard's dead.
We're livin' up here like fugitives.

635
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,579
What the hell
do you think you're doin'?

636
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,499
I don't know.

637
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,584
Maybe I'm tryin' to get some attention,

638
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:38,921
or to get President Hayes
to look this way.

639
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:43,384
They let Murphy and his bankers get
away with anything. I can't allow that.

640
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,679
The more bastards I dust,
the more news stories they write.

641
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,722
The more troops they send after us,

642
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:55,521
the more President Hayes has to come
down, see for himself what's going on.

643
01:02:55,605 --> 01:03:00,234
Then he'll find out
who's really doing the killing.

644
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,407
Alex.

645
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,826
What are you gonna do?

646
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:14,457
I'm gonna try to reach
the president myself, legally.

647
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,418
It won't be easy
to get past the governor.

648
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,086
I got plans for the governor.

649
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:22,465
What if you can't get in touch
with Hayes?

650
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,970
I'll go back to Lincoln
and reopen John's store.

651
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:32,475
- That's what John would want.
- We'll escort you.

652
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,396
You'd be a death sentence to anyone
now, Billy. I don't want your help.

653
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:42,401
You didn't see
what they did to John.

654
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,571
We did.

655
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,457
Christ, Billy.

656
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,795
Thank you, Billy.

657
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,089
Billy, please, go to Old Mexico.

658
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,175
Please.

659
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:23,651
(Billy) Gentlemen, let's ride.

660
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,466
- Alex...
- What the hell happened, Doc?

661
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,845
It is a whirlwind out there.

662
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:56,684
When you're in it,
you can't get out.

663
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,852
I'm sorry.

664
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:04,567
I was wonderin'
if you remember that China doll -

665
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,945
you know, at the dance...
the fandango?

666
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,824
I was sort of thinkin',
cos you're a lawyer and all,

667
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,076
maybe there was a legal way...

668
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:20,583
I don't even have enough ground
to stand on any more, Doc. I mean it.

669
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,835
OK. Yeah.

670
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:26,547
Thanks.

671
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,552
Take care of yourself, Alex.

672
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,304
OK?

673
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,106
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

674
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,694
He's just bellyachin'
about somethin' or another.

675
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,907
He got mighty spooked.

676
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:02,541
Dirty Steve told me, Billy. He told me
what they're writin' in the papers.

677
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:07,129
Steven told him about the party
Sheriff Peppin's plannin' for us.

678
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,548
Party?
Oh, you mean the hangin'.

679
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,091
Cállate, Chivato.

680
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:14,094
Goddammit, Billy!

681
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:17,097
You ever seen a man hanged?

682
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,893
His face turns purple,
and his eyes come up on him.

683
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,062
I seen Red Smitty hang.

684
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:29,985
Billy. I don't think Charley
wants to hear about Red Smitty.

685
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:34,782
I think what he'd like to hear
is that we're not going to hang.

686
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,826
You mess your trousers, they say.

687
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,579
Gals watchin' and everything.

688
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:45,709
Well, if we get caught, Charley,
we're gonna hang.

689
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:51,507
But there's many a slip
'twixt a cup and a lip.

690
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,971
We got to do somethin'
before they catch us.

691
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,184
Y'all got to let me do somethin'.

692
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,269
OK, Charley.

693
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,968
Charley, this is your last wish?

694
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,804
Get your carrot wet?
You could do that in Juárez.

695
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:43,267
Somethin' called a special woman, dirt
face. You'll understand that one day.

696
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:54,403
All right, gentlemen,
square up and shell out for Bowdre.

697
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,490
We'll be in the den.

698
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:03,203
- Yell if you need any help.
- You know what to do, don't you?

699
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,684
What's your name?

700
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:28,562
Charley.

701
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:31,523
Well, Charley,

702
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,526
I don't remember you
but I guess you remember me.

703
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:39,406
I meet so many young men
out for the first. You know how it is.

704
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,702
Why don't you come over here,
Charley?

705
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:49,291
Uh, ma'am,

706
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,710
I just want to hold you.

707
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:57,716
Whatever your pleasure, Charley,

708
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:00,052
but it all costs the same.

709
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:29,081
(man) Darlin', when a man rides
200 miles for a job,

710
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:33,502
you can bet
he's gonna get that job done.

711
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,798
If this Billy the Kid's
around town like people say,

712
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:40,551
he is $200 flat dead on this bar.

713
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,638
You can't kill what you can't catch.

714
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:47,015
These mestizos,

715
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,935
they say that Billito's half horse,

716
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,187
half devil.

717
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:58,944
But who knows? Maybe a strong,
big Texas man like you can do...

718
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,821
You gonna kill Billy the Kid?

719
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:04,449
Does a horse piss
where she pleases?

720
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,952
(man) If he's man enough
to come around here.

721
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,122
(Billy) Is that the gun
you're gonna shoot him down with?

722
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,332
Can I touch it?

723
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,334
Please?

724
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:18,338
You know, sir, I do admire you,

725
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:23,510
and I sure would like to touch the gun
that's gonna kill Billy the Kid.

726
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:26,305
- You know iron, boy?
- Yes, sir.

727
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,184
Go ahead, then.

728
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,562
Have a look.

729
01:10:35,315 --> 01:10:37,858
Pass her back.
That gun killed Ed Rollins.

730
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,359
Is that right?

731
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:45,908
Let's have a little round of stone fence
for every little lady in the house.

732
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,577
OK. Pass it back, son.

733
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:54,207
Stroke a gun like that, you might as well
be strokin' a man's woman. Pass it up.

734
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,710
Whoop!

735
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:03,383
All right. Now, you best be on your way
before you get hurt.

736
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,594
Uh, I'm leavin' right now,

737
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:09,556
and I wanna know what to look for
in case I run into him.

738
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:15,395
Dresses like a dandy,
and he's a left-hander.

739
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:19,441
People say he's fond
of whistlin' sad ballads.

740
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:24,446
Now, you get out in the street
and see somebody that fits that bill,

741
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,823
you just come whisperin' to me.

742
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,034
OK.

743
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,119
Bye-bye.

744
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,085
Hey! I see him!

745
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,297
Right there!
Don't you see him?

746
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,886
Is that so, now?

747
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:52,099
You know, boy,
I'm gettin' a little tired of your wise lip.

748
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:59,106
Before I have to drop your britches
in front of all these fine ladies

749
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:02,067
and spank your little bottom blue.

750
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,779
(? Whistles sad ballad)

751
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:15,288
Yeah, sure.
You are a testy little cuss.

752
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,088
(gun clicks)

753
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,842
(clicks)

754
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,888
(? Continues whistling)

755
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,853
(laughs)

756
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:42,607
Hey, Doc, how many
does that make? 25?

757
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,402
Five.

758
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:50,449
We'll call it ten, ten even.
How'd that be?

759
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,617
Whatever you say.

760
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,496
It's John Kinney!

761
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,368
Come on!

762
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,122
Whoa!

763
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:43,168
God! Argh!

764
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,025
Where are they?

765
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:12,572
"His hat was covered
with gold and jewels."

766
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:17,077
"It sparkled in a dazzling, blinding
manner when one looked upon it."

767
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,245
Aah! Oh!

768
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,665
I know, I know.
It breaks my heart, too.

769
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,545
"The shoes worn by this young,
left-handed prince of the plains

770
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:31,216
were low-quartered with patterned
silver spurs in the heels."

771
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,552
I ain't left-handed.

772
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:36,304
Billy,

773
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,765
I was thinkin' about our course.

774
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:42,227
It looks like we've just done
a big circle twice.

775
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,104
And?

776
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:47,315
It also looks like
we're going back into Lincoln.

777
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,568
We are.

778
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:56,658
- Ain't a good idea, Billy.
- Billy, what are you thinkin'?

779
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:00,829
Billy, we're lucky to be alive.
Goin' back to Lincoln, that's crazy.

780
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:04,916
- We'll find the men who killed John.
- It's 100 against five!

781
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,252
(mocking) "It's 100 against five!"

782
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,754
We take Murphy, and the ring falls.

783
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:14,426
We take him, we win this war.
Then it'll be over.

784
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,679
- Can't get to him, Billy.
- (Chavez) It's not just 100 men.

785
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,933
There's bounty hunters, too,
everywhere we go... but not west.

786
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,773
I chose your way,
but I don't trust it any more.

787
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:38,366
California sounds about right to me.

788
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,495
You're all scared.

789
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:50,837
- And you're gonna fail the test.
- What test?

790
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:53,298
You have to test yourself every day.

791
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:57,177
Once you stop testin' yourself,
you get slow.

792
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:00,722
When that happens, they kill you.

793
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,143
You fellas don't feel that?

794
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:09,231
Like when John Kinney's
riding up on our ass

795
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,650
and the blood goes
right to your head?

796
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,360
Ha-ha! Woo!

797
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:18,031
- It's quite a sensation.
- (Doc) Yeah, I bet it is.

798
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:21,159
I'm sure you hear trumpets sound
and angels sing a hymn.

799
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,161
I shit in my goddamn britches!

800
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:26,665
OK? We've taken enough
goddamn Murphy scalps!

801
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:30,252
We cannot win this war,
not the five of us.

802
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,672
Do you understand?

803
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,006
No.

804
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:39,761
Billy, you want to get
the president's attention, go ahead.

805
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,515
You want to keep testing yourself?
Fine.

806
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:50,689
Come morning, I'm a Mexican.

807
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,984
Yeah, Billy. Yeah, me, too.

808
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,363
Mexico, huh?

809
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,949
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

810
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,786
I see. You're testin' yourselves,
and you don't even know it.

811
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,581
- Old Mexico - that's a hoot.
- What do you mean?

812
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:13,044
They'll cover every possible which way
from Texas to Arizona.

813
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,630
John Kinney knows everyone
along the border.

814
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:18,383
There's a full day's ride
through them thorns,

815
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:22,095
which also makes a good hiding place
for scalp hunters and Indians.

816
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:25,432
The chances of making Old Mexico?

817
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,434
Well, hell.

818
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:31,271
That's the test of all tests,
if you ask me.

819
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:34,024
I'm in.

820
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:40,447
I'm really not liking him.

821
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,251
- (woman) ¡El Chivato!
- (man) ¡El Chivato!

822
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,587
¡El Chivato!

823
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,473
"Dear Governor Ax-tell..."

824
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,975
- Axtell.
- Right.

825
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:13,146
"I have heard that you will give..."
What is it?

826
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:16,483
- 200.
- "...$200 for my head."

827
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:20,987
"Perhaps we should meet and talk."

828
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:24,491
"I am at the Juárez village
at the border."

829
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:26,951
"Send three men

830
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,954
and instruct them not to shoot,

831
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,791
as I am unarmed."

832
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,296
"In short, sir,

833
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,508
I surrender."

834
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:47,764
"Your obedient servant,
William H Bonney."

835
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:03,488
Damn good ridin' with you, Chavez.

836
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,744
Many nights, my friend...

837
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:17,168
many nights, I put a blade to your throat
while you were sleeping.

838
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,338
I'm glad I never killed you, Steve.

839
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:22,215
You're all right.

840
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,413
"PS,

841
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:56,708
I changed my mind. Kiss my ass."

842
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,212
Charley's gettin' married!

843
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,298
(? Lively music)

844
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:43,004
Anybody asks you
where you got that hat,

845
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,757
tell them Billy the Kid gave it to you.

846
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,176
Now, go on, get out of here.

847
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,638
(gun cocking)

848
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:54,265
- Pat Garrett.
- That's right.

849
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,936
What are you doing in here?
No one's supposed to come in here.

850
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,522
Going back to Louisiana
for family business.

851
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:03,149
Wanted to see the boy
who's become a sensation.

852
01:21:03,234 --> 01:21:05,985
- How'd you find me?
- I'm a tracker.

853
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,987
Gonna be hell as a sheriff.

854
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:11,491
- What are you saying, Pat?
- The officials have asked me to run.

855
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:14,536
Well, then, I'm asking you to run, too -

856
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,788
that way,

857
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:20,041
or I'll take your shittin' scalp
like I did Brady's.

858
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,336
Billy, I ain't the law yet.

859
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:30,051
I've come to tell you some bad news
about a friend we share.

860
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:32,595
McSween, Tunstall's lawyer.

861
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:36,683
- What about Alex?
- He's going to die tomorrow.

862
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,143
He and his wife, at his house.

863
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,563
Murphy knows
he's coming back to Lincoln.

864
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,815
They're going to pay him a visit.

865
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,818
- What time do they expect him?
- Suppertime.

866
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:54,826
To give the man and his wife
a rightful escort across the border.

867
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:57,704
Ain't been to Louisiana for a spell.

868
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,331
I'll see you, Billy.

869
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,500
Hey, Garrett.

870
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,674
Are you my friend?

871
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,847
Yes, I am, Bill.

872
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,651
(gunshot)

873
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,529
(Billy) Regulators!

874
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:43,416
(gun barrel clicking)

875
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,642
(Billy) Hey, Charley.

876
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,644
Maybe you should stay.

877
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:05,563
You can't shoot
worth a piss anyhow.

878
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,150
Your girl's crying.
Giving me a headache.

879
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,611
Charley, you got a wife now.

880
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,780
You should stay.

881
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,799
Ain't easy havin' pals.

882
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,551
Hah!

883
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,490
- Alex?
- Alex?

884
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,619
What in the name of...?

885
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:05,331
Alex, let's go. Word's out -
they're gonna come kill you.

886
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:08,668
Dammit, Billy,
I told you not to come here.

887
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:12,046
- I'm not leaving my house.
- (Billy) If you stay, they'll kill you.

888
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:15,550
Then I'll have to go around
and kill all the guys who killed you.

889
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:18,678
- That's a lot of killing.
- You heard me, Billy.

890
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,638
You heard me!

891
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:24,016
We can't just stay here
and hope that the good Lord saves us...

892
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:26,644
Susan, I'm sick.

893
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,980
I can't go to Old Mexico.

894
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:33,985
Out in the middle of the street!
Come on!

895
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:38,489
Don't fret, Alex.
The trip's postponed.

896
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:41,159
- They're coming around the front.
- Shit.

897
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:45,496
Bring those wagons up. Quickly!
Keep the house covered.

898
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,707
It's Peppin.

899
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,670
Get that wagon over!

900
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:54,839
Joe, move it!

901
01:24:57,885 --> 01:24:59,761
- Murphy men.
- (cocks gun)

902
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:04,932
Charley?

903
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:08,561
How's it over by you?
Can we break?

904
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,526
Uh.

905
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:22,241
Hey, Charley! How is it?

906
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,953
It... it's John Kinney.

907
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:31,876
I think the word you got was a trap
to get us all together in the same place.

908
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,713
My God, look at them all.
It's gonna be a massacre.

909
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,132
Take care of the horses!

910
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:46,057
- It... it's John Kinney.
- Well, maybe they just want us.

911
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:48,392
No.

912
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:52,730
They figure they can end the war
right here, in one fell swoop.

913
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:56,317
- That's what they're about to do.
- It's John Kinney!

914
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,612
Thank you very much, Charley!

915
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,781
Jesus.

916
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:06,744
Come on, move it.

917
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,000
Charley.

918
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,465
Oh, God.

919
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,884
Hanging for sure now.

920
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,601
Hm.

921
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:34,272
All right.

922
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:40,820
Take a look
at the firepower down here.

923
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:44,282
Y'all come on out! Real slow!

924
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:49,537
You up there, Bonney?

925
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:56,627
Let's have some fun, Doc.
Yeah, I'm here, you bastard!

926
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:53,517
What the hell
are we gonna do now?

927
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:58,564
We're gonna show these guys
they've finally met their match.

928
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,776
- Hey, Peppin?
- I'm hearin' you, Bonney!

929
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,363
I see you got Charley Crawford
down there with you.

930
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:08,532
Yeah, we got a whole lot...

931
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:11,285
- Oh, my God!
- Damn!

932
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:17,625
Hey, Peppin? Charley Crawford
ain't with you any more!

933
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,962
Bastard! Fire!

934
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:42,400
- You all right, Doc?
- Yeah.

935
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,487
Boy, these boys won't give up!

936
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,950
You OK, ma'am? You OK?

937
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:53,494
You OK?

938
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:55,413
- Charley?
- Yeah.

939
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:57,832
Take two rifles, go on upstairs.

940
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:01,335
Doc? You go up with him.
Load heavy!

941
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:05,256
Steve? Go on up
and cover the north side.

942
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,800
Alex?

943
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:12,263
This may be your last chance
to handle John's case.

944
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,932
Active participation in a gun battle

945
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:23,482
(man) We know you can shoot, Bonney!
We can, too! Give it up!

946
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,234
Chavez?

947
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,675
(creaking)

948
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,872
Chivato.

949
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:34,029
(Billy) They sent in the troops. (laughs)

950
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:42,246
Billy, we're good,
but this is getting ridiculous.

951
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,248
Dismount!

952
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:02,391
I like these odds. (laughs)

953
01:32:06,897 --> 01:32:09,273
Mr Murphy. Judge Bristol.

954
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:13,694
- We got all the rats in one hole.
- What's been taking so long?

955
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:17,781
We didn't want the army here.
We don't need that kind of attention.

956
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:24,955
- Son of a bitch.
- (man) Quite a bit of excitement.

957
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:26,665
Why are you here, Nathan?

958
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:30,294
I was dispatched here
to make sure it doesn't get out of hand.

959
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:33,839
If you have any hopes
for a political future,

960
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,884
you will respond to our suggestions.

961
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:39,678
And what do you suggest, sir?

962
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:42,514
Full military attack. Destroy them.

963
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:45,059
China! Soldiers, stop her!

964
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:46,268
Yen!

965
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:50,105
Stop her! China!

966
01:32:51,358 --> 01:32:53,359
China!

967
01:32:54,361 --> 01:32:56,612
(Doc) Yen!

968
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:04,286
- (Murphy) The troops're being fired on.
- Cover me.

969
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,581
But your... the girl!

970
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:10,834
- Burn it!
- Excuse me?

971
01:33:11,253 --> 01:33:13,045
Burn it!

972
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,008
- (Nathan) Mr Murphy!
- Never mind, Colonel.

973
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:23,180
Tell your troops not to mind my men
when they go around back.

974
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:26,725
(Nathan) Sergeant,
put your men on the line!

975
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:34,149
- Six squads up front.
- Come on, let's go.

976
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:46,036
Fire!

977
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:14,315
(Nathan) Hold your fire!

978
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,608
Dammit, cease fire!

979
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:18,902
Hey, Billy, please.

980
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:21,113
I got to go. I got to go.

981
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:26,076
I got a wife. I got a wife.
She's this little Mexican gal. Please!

982
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:30,956
Charley, start whipping some ass
or you'll never see her again!

983
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,083
Now, come on, Charley.

984
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:37,046
Go on, now! Come on, giddup!

985
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,424
That's it. Come on, let's go!

986
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:49,224
They lit it, boys!
They lit the house!

987
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:54,480
(Nathan) Mr Bonney!
Mr McSween!

988
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:57,691
This is Colonel Nathan Dudley!

989
01:34:57,776 --> 01:35:00,235
Come on out with your hands high!

990
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:05,074
"With your hands high."

991
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:10,454
I better reason with him.

992
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:15,125
Hey, Colonel Shithead!
You can kiss my ass!

993
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,169
Goddamn it, Billy!

994
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:21,048
You get President Hayes down here,
then we'll come out!

995
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,842
- We'll see how they like that.
- (gunfire)

996
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:48,367
Hey, Kinney, you bastard!

997
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:51,036
I'm going to shoot your ass!

998
01:35:51,037 --> 01:35:54,873
I'll shoot you from here to Patricio
if I have to, you shit dog!

999
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,292
- Yeah, Charley.
- (Charley) Maniac!

1000
01:35:57,877 --> 01:35:59,878
(yells)

1001
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,176
Get 'em!

1002
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:10,264
Maniac!

1003
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,270
Yeah, Charley!

1004
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:18,188
Yeah!

1005
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:21,066
- Yeah, Charley!
- Yeah! Yeah!

1006
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:25,571
Yeah, Charley!

1007
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,698
Yeah!

1008
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,327
Woooo!

1009
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:34,997
Yeah.

1010
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,208
(laughs)

1011
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:42,171
Yeah, Charley.

1012
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:47,384
Alex! Get Susan out of here!

1013
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:49,803
- Come on, get out.
- Stop.

1014
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:56,101
- No, I want my things.
- Susan, come on, get out!

1015
01:36:56,186 --> 01:36:58,187
(screams)

1016
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:04,234
There's a woman coming out!
Let my wife come out!

1017
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:08,071
Hold it. There's a lady coming out.
Hold your fire!

1018
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:16,788
Yen, go home.

1019
01:37:21,169 --> 01:37:23,253
- Go!
- I stay with you.

1020
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:25,506
Necessary.

1021
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:27,591
(coughs)

1022
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:29,426
Colonel.

1023
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:34,681
Colonel, can I do anything for you, sir?
Back in the tent, perhaps?

1024
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:38,101
I have no time for complaints.
Go to the other side of the street

1025
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:40,479
so I can do my j...

1026
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:44,149
- You animal.
- Get her out of here! Take her away!

1027
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,318
Leave me alone!

1028
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:52,699
Alex!

1029
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:59,164
Where's Chavez?
Where the hell's Chavez?

1030
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:00,832
- I don't know!
- What?

1031
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:02,834
He's gone.
He must have skinned out!

1032
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:06,213
I knew it! That dirty Mexican dog!

1033
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:08,173
I... I...

1034
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:11,343
I knew we shouldn't have trusted him!
I knew it!

1035
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:15,472
We're gonna die in here and he's
out there doin' it with his horse!

1036
01:38:15,557 --> 01:38:19,184
I knew it! I just knew it!

1037
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,158
(coughing)

1038
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:38,287
Yeah!

1039
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:59,016
(roars)

1040
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,035
Run!

1041
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:32,299
Chavez!

1042
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,552
Yeah!

1043
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,721
Regulators!

1044
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,060
Billy!

1045
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:47,898
(screams)

1046
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:53,779
Hey, Kinney, you bastard,
it's you and I!

1047
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,125
Doc!

1048
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:39,616
Go, go, go!

1049
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:03,306
He's getting away!
Dudley! Get that son of a bitch!

1050
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:06,476
- Ride, boys!
- (Murphy) Dudley!

1051
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:09,771
- Get that son of a bitch!
- Ride!

1052
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:29,791
Those bastards...

1053
01:41:34,255 --> 01:41:37,340
Reap it, Murphy,
you son of a bitch.

1054
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,230
Now it's over.

1055
01:41:54,192 --> 01:41:58,945
(Doc) Advices from Lincoln report Jose
Chavez Y Chavez moved to California

1056
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:03,200
where he changed his name
and took work on a fruit ranch.

1057
01:42:03,284 --> 01:42:07,412
Josiah "Doc" Scurlock was reported
to have left the West for the East,

1058
01:42:07,497 --> 01:42:12,250
taking with him a Celestial bride, her
mother, and 14 brothers and sisters.

1059
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:16,880
Susan McSween saw her husband's
and John Tunstall's dreams to fruition

1060
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:21,468
by becoming one of the most
prominent cattle women of all time.

1061
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:25,305
Governor Axtell was forced to resign
by president Rutherford B Hayes

1062
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:31,436
and both the Murphy-Dolan faction
and the Santa Fe ring collapsed.

1063
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:35,106
William H Bonney -
also known as Billy the Kid -

1064
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:38,068
continued to ride,
never leaving New Mexico.

1065
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:42,280
He was caught in Fort Sumner
by the sheriff Pat Garrett and killed.

1066
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:46,618
Sources report that he was unarmed
and shot in the dark.

1067
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:50,831

in Old Fort Sumner.

1068
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:55,794
Advices report that an unidentified
person snuck into the graveyard

1069
01:42:58,339 --> 01:43:01,424
The epitaph read only one word:

1070
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:03,426
"Pals."
