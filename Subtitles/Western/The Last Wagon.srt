Because they weren't Apaches---
they were his own Comanches.

And he didn't warn anybody.
That's why he's alive.

1011
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,506
In that Bible there,
ain't it justice that counts?

1012
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:25,102
Everywhere on Earth people's got laws
that's maybe different from their neighbors.

1013
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:27,874
But justice don't change nowhere...

1014
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:31,145
even in places where they give medals
for killin' Indians, like out here.

1015
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:33,152
Medals like that one you're wearin'!

1016
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:35,620
I have no need to
tolerate abuse from you.

1017
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:37,623
You're in no position
to challenge my motives.

1018
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,125
I've always done what I believed right.

1019
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:42,457
Oh, and so has he!

1020
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:46,090
All I've heard here is talk of killing,
of the taking of lives.

1021
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,294
I've heard no one say anything
about giving lives.

1022
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:51,303
You say he took four lives.

1023
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:55,569
Well, isn't there anything in that Bible
about giving six lives back, and more?

1024
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,907
Like these others who might be dead
if it weren't for him.

1025
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,176
When he could have saved himself,
he saved us.

1026
01:37:02,283 --> 01:37:05,446
When he could have gone,
and I urged him to go...

1027
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:08,954
he chose to stay
and see us through to safety.

1028
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:13,220
Maybe this is a different kind
of an eye for an eye---

1029
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:17,024
the giving of lives
instead of the taking of lives.

1030
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:20,032
But I know any one of us is willing now...

1031
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:22,125
to give our lives for him.

1032
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:26,105
He did more for me than save my life.

1033
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:28,334
He made me grow up.

1034
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:34,672
He gave me something
I couldn't have lived without---

1035
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:36,750
pride in myself.

1036
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,618
We want him to live, sir.

1037
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:51,064
I was moved by what you said
about the giving of lives.

1038
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:55,595
Do you love this man?

1039
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:02,708
Of course.

1040
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,736
Yes, son?

1041
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:10,442
- So do I.

- The hearing will come to order.

1043
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:18,891
By the authority vested in me
by the president of the United States...

1044
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:22,258
I'm ready to pass judgment on this man,
Comanche Todd.

1045
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:24,729
You've spoken well for the Indian...

1046
01:38:24,832 --> 01:38:28,233
and through your subsequent actions
have helped your fellow whites.

1047
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:31,771
And as an alternate
to hanging this man...

1048
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:33,772
would you both agree...

1049
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,934
to take him into custody for
as long as you both shall live?

1050
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:41,245
Oh, yes, I do.

1051
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:43,578
- Me too.
