at the red pony.

881
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:46,799

working out of.

What are the three
other things?

884
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:53,505
First,

885
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:55,474
while I could not find
Avo myself,

886
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:57,008
we spoke through a cousin.

887
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,944
Avo will meet you tomorrow
morning, 11:00 am.

888
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,646
There is an old, empty cabin

889
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,515
about three miles
off the highway

890
00:43:03,616 --> 00:43:05,484
near the South entrance
of the res.

891
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:09,420
Second -- I do not think
you should go.

892
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:10,754
It sounds like a setup,

893
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:11,955
and there's already
one dead white guy.

894
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,757
What's the third thing?

895
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:17,060
Since you will no doubt ignore
me and go meet Avo anyway,

896
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,962
I would like to propose
an O.I.T.

897
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,465
O.I.T.?

898
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,967
Old Indian trick.

902

You're early.

903
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:54,620
Old Indian trick.

904
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:56,755
Surprise is a powerful weapon.

905
00:43:56,856 --> 00:43:59,724
Speaking of which,
would you mind telling me

906
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:02,376
why you came three hours early
to your own meeting?

907
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:06,097
And if you can tell me unarmed,
I'd appreciate that.

908
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:11,102
Sheriff,
I didn't kill that guy.

909
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:12,503
You got to help me.

910
00:44:12,604 --> 00:44:13,970
Let's talk.

911
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:18,509
The dead guy --
I met him a couple times.

912
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,910
He came into the red pony.

913
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:21,912
Said he was looking
to get laid.

914
00:44:22,013 --> 00:44:25,783
Everybody knows
if you want to get laid,

915
00:44:25,884 --> 00:44:29,919
you talk to the Indian
at the red pony.

916
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,454
What did you do?

917
00:44:31,555 --> 00:44:34,557
I sent him to the girls.
That was a mistake.

918
00:44:34,658 --> 00:44:36,426
I heard later
he was freaking out

919
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:37,560
when he got to the RV,

920
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,194
yelling and waving
a gun around.

921
00:44:39,296 --> 00:44:41,898
So when he came back the other
day, I said, "No way, man."

922
00:44:41,998 --> 00:44:44,699
He came back after causing
a scene like that?

923
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:47,736
He apologized and said
he was upset the first time

924
00:44:47,837 --> 00:44:51,105
'cause what he was really
looking for was an Indian girl.

925
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:52,874
Guess that's his thing.

926
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:55,444
He wanted to poke a Pocahontas.

927
00:44:55,545 --> 00:44:58,079
Anyway, I didn't want a problem
with that crazy guy,

928
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,547
so I told him where to go,

929
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:01,081
but I called it in right away.

930
00:45:01,182 --> 00:45:03,551
I told them,
"Better move the RV."

931
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:05,586
I didn't know
he was gonna kill him.

Who is "he"?

934
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:16,062
Avo, whoever "he" is,
is trying to frame you.

935
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:18,765
Now, the only way
I can protect you

936
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:21,067
is if you tell me
who you're working for.

937
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:22,435
Understand?
