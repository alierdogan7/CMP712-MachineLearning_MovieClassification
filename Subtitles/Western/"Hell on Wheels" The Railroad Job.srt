And, Dennis,

Just a blonde girl and a pencil

The one guard all we
got to worry about?

21
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:14,551
You remember that nigger guard
on the train with the gun?

22
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,219
The one that buffaloed Bohannon?

23
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,377
Strutting around like
a big old black rooster.

24
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:27,397
I knew somethin' weren't
right with him and Bohannon.

25
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:32,611
And get this, Bohannon himself
is working on the railroad.

Druther not run into no Bohannon.

Shit, I ain't worried.

28

to keep you locked up,

he's drinkin', I apologize.

00:11:57,211 --> 00:12:00,591
Perhaps you'll allow me to buy
this negro gentleman a drink.

134
00:12:00,716 --> 00:12:03,014
He usually drinks a bottle.

135
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,224

The last time I saw that Griswold

146

Cullen Bohannon was
pointing it in my face.

147
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:41,344
It's a common sidearm
among the Southerners.

that's robbing your trains.

No, sir. But I got a
feeling something's up.

That ain't right.

155
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:59,696
Arm whoever's in town and post
them by the railroad office.

156
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,615
Nobody in town 'cept
shopkeepers and sick list.

Oh, and send a fast rider
to fetch Bohannon.

Yes, sir.

161

but it's got to be...

What can we do for you?

165
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,566
You need rifles.
Come on.

166
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,608
Rifles?

167
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:38,503
It's the Germans.

168
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,778
Nah. There's gonna be some trouble.

169
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:42,741
I need men who will kill.

170
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,300
Stop!

171
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:50,318
Then why you comin' to us?
We're not riflemen.

172
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:53,166
Yeah, we're businessmen,
we're not killers.

173

Today you be what I say you be.

174
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,155
Come on.

175
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:10,808
Damn.

176
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:14,645
Carl's got guns under
the bar. Go get 'em.

177
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,647
Right.
Go get 'em!

178
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,524
Go get 'em now!

179
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,292
[Cough]

180
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:27,200

00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,565
{pub}I feel ashamed.

371
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,024
You done everything you could.

372
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:21,641
For a moment, I felt...

373
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:25,032
Relief that he might not live.

374
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:31,749
You yourself would be free...

375
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:34,129
From your debt to the railroad.

376
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,092
Ohh.

377
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,469
He ain't dead yet.

378
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,861
I should telegraph his wife.

379
00:28:45,986 --> 00:28:47,392
She should know.

380
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:58,501
He needs a more qualified
surgeon, ma'am,

381
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:00,656
not some battlefield
sawbones like me.

382
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,532
If I'd run across him
like this in the war,

383
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:05,266
I would have moved
on to the next man.

384
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:07,878
You best do everything in
your power to keep him alive.

385
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:10,874
He needs to be opened up, Cullen.

386
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,654
That bullet ripped up his insides,
it's lodged against his spine.

387
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,087
I don't have the tools
or the expertise.

388
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:19,591
Can we take him to Chicago?

389
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,511
The ride will probably kill him.

390
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:28,084
I'm doing all I can.

391
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:34,239
Ya couldn't have just ridden
on to Mexico, could you?

392
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:36,639
I tried to tell you,
Cullen, a hundred times...

393
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:38,139
Uh-uh, no. Uh-uh.

394
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:42,739
'cause there never was
any Mexico, was there?

395
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,737
Was there, doc?

396
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,088
Look what I found.

397
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,360
Good.

398
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,146
Put 'em on.

399
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,636
Hey!

400
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:31,771
Hey, where are we going?

401
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,396
You'll find out soon.

402
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:39,504
[Grunting]

403
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,982
[All yelling]

404
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:44,290
This ain't right.
This ain't right.

405
00:30:44,415 --> 00:30:46,292
This ain't fair.

406
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:49,197
I ain't done nothin'
you ain't done, Bohannon!

407
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:53,894
Nothin'! You hear me
talkin' to you, boy?

408
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:56,028
[Grunting]

409
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:00,842
I get a trial.

410
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:03,345
You can't execute a man
without trying him first.

411
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,148
That's the law.

412
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:06,916
We still got laws!

413
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,019
The president of
the United States has spoke.

414
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:11,161
We still got laws!

415
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,215
[Thunder]

416
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:15,887
[Grunts]

417
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:22,227
Ah!

418
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:38,676
You was with that railroad
the whole time, wasn't ya?

419
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,235
Look at me, damn ya.

420
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,256
How'd you end up with
these Yankee bastards, anyhow?

421
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,745
Why you here?

422
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:58,166
You want to say your last words?

423
00:32:00,903 --> 00:32:02,904
Yeah.

424
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,276
I do.

425
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,894
You're a coward, Bohannon.

426
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,921
You're yella and I always knowed it.

427
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,846
You betrayed your country,
son, and everyone in it.

428
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,401
Heh.

429
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:42,688
I know something was squirrelly

430
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:45,092
when you let this here
nigger get the drop on you.

431
00:32:45,217 --> 00:32:46,339
But...[Laughing]

432
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:50,333
I ain't never figured you
for no nigger lover.

433
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,960
[Laughing]
[Gunshot]

434
00:32:56,098 --> 00:32:58,301
Damn it, Elam, the man wasn't done

435
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:57,285
{pub}You're awake.

436
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,015
How's the pain?

437
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,374
[Groans]

438
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,961
I've got some tincture
of opium if you'd like.

439
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,690
N-no.

440
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,158
It would help you sleep.

441
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,327
Uh... no. No.

442
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,754
[Breathing heavily]

443
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,985
Can you feel your leg?

444
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,488
No.

445
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,891
[Grunting]

446
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:39,130
Mr. Durant, I know you're a doctor,

447
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,496
so I'm gonna give it to you straight.

448
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,001
The bullet, it ruptured your spleen,

449
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,805
is probably lodged
against your spine.

450
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,909
I think it nicked the lineal artery,

451
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:51,845
but I'm sorry, sir,

452
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,344
I don't have the means
to get in there and fix it.

453
00:34:58,773 --> 00:35:00,223
Lily: What do we do?

454
00:35:07,116 --> 00:35:09,357
The bleeding's slowing down.

455
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:12,861
He's got a stout heart.

456
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,907
I'd risk a train ride.

457
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,836
Yes, sir.

458
00:35:30,983 --> 00:35:33,089
Ah.

459
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,053
Storslatte.

460
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,486
You're handsome.

461
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,073
Thank you, Thor.

462
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,283
Hmm.

463
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,037
But... why?

464
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,956
Why?

465
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:11,044
Why did you save me?

466
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,691
Come and see.

467
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,003
Come. Come. Come,
come, come, come, come.

468
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:24,698
Come, come, come, come.

469
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,683
The lord, holy and true,

470
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:31,523
has saved you, Reverend, not me.

471
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:40,826
To judge and avenge in
the name of the dissipated,

472
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:45,321
a great sword is given unto you.

473
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:55,004
Surely now, she pulled our peckers
when they needed pulling...

474
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:56,847
[Laughter]

475
00:36:56,972 --> 00:37:01,302
Let the twins out to play when
they needed some company...

476
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:02,762
Bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh.

477
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:06,641
[Laughing]

478
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,269
She petted your head,

479
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,147
made you change your drawers.

480
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:16,897
She was the one to say,

481
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:22,532
"it's all right, Mickey,
it's all right."

482
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,409
[Crying]

483
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,518

484
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:33,220
All: To Nell!

485
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:34,752

[All cheering]

487
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,882
He may be a son of a bitch,

488
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,997
but he's our son of a bitch!

[All cheering]

490
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:48,933
Mr. Ferguson, it'd be best if
you drink elsewhere tonight.

491
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:52,437
I'm drinking here tonight.

492
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:59,485
Well, you were seen hiding around
a boxcar during the robbery.

493
00:38:04,844 --> 00:38:06,826
I was in the thick of it.

494
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:11,456
Yeah, from which Mr. Bohannon
saved your black bottom.

495

Eyes wild, horse snortin'...

00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:58,579
Ha ha! It's him or me...

499
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,613
That's right.
And I lay him low!

500
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,633
Ha ha! Lay him low.
That's right.

501
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,593
Hold up, y'all. Hold up.

502
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,352
You in the wrong place,
ain't ya, son?

00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:10,682
The white folk bar over yonder.

504
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,993
Come to drink with y'all.

505

Hmm?

506
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,887
All right.

507
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:27,894
See what you got here.

508
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,539
Hmm. Tennessee.

509
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:36,807
That there the good stuff.

510
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,321
Not that rot gut y'all drink.

511
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:45,315
Hmm. Well, y'all, go on
and break that open. Hmm?

512
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,222
Enjoy yourself.

513
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,017
Guess me and you

514
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,191

Mm-hmm.

518
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:38,644
Make you see
the good lord first though.

519
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,459
You ever wonder what'll happen
to y'all if old man Durant die?

520
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:10,635
Reckon we be on the first
train smokin' back to Georgia.

521
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:14,764
How about you?

522
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:18,351
What about me?

523
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,581
How long you think you
gonna last in this town...

524
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:23,439
Without him to protect you?

525
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:25,900
Hmm?

526
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,237
Just be another nigger
in the white man world.

527
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:36,661
Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

530
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,019
Is he dead?

531
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:04,684
No.

532
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,298
No. I already buried Hawkins.

533
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,743
It says "all those
aiding and abetting."

534
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:32,341
But doc... doc just held the horses.

535
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:36,804
