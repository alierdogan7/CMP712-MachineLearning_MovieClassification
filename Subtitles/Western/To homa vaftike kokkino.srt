1
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:08,935
Passengers getting off at Kalabaka,
 please get ready.

2
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:12,062
Passengers getting off at Kalabaka,
 please get ready.

3
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:40,265
Don't say anything.
You'll leave when I give you a signal.

4
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,554
Everybody sit down.

5
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,059
Get off.

6
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,242
- Why?
- Get off.

7
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:29,867
Move it.

8
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:57,963
Give me your papers.

9
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,164
Where are you coming from?

10
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,027
I bet you already know that.

11
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,388
Where are you planning to go?

12
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,990
Home, if you don't have any objections.

13
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:22,306
At Kalabaka the workers were waiting
at the station to welcome you.

14
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:24,658
We were afraid they might cause trouble.

15
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,682
If your welcoming is over,
I should be moving on.

16
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:30,777
Listen, Odysseas Hormovas,

17
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,913
while you were gone, we fought hard
to make the people settle.

18
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:36,374
And they didn't?

19
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:37,870
Not much it seems.

20
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,493
The fire is still burning.

21
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,159
And you want me to put it out?

22
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,996
What I want is that you
stay out of trouble this time.

23
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,307
You are the son of a nobleman,
a squire, with plenty of wealth.

24
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:50,123
Your interest should be with the law,

25
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:53,670
not with the ragged ones who want
to take the land from you.

26
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,876
Thanks for the advice. Anything else?

27
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:58,500
One more thing.

28
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,729
Do you know a guy named Antypas?
Marinos Antypas.

29
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:02,906
Why?

30
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:06,024
Because if I find that you
hang out with him,

31
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,562
I will you send you back to jail.

32
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:09,898
Take your papers.

33
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,716
Landless all of them, poor fellows.

34
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:46,021
They harvest the plantations
for a piece of bread.

35
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,474
They took arms and rose
against the landlords four years ago.

36
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:51,419
They asked for a piece of the land.

37
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:55,598
Their masters showed no mercy and
bashed them, you should remember.

38
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:56,654
I do.

39
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,712
They are now scared
that they might rise again

40
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:00,940
and they hire workers
from distant places.

41
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,997
They keep the locals out of the fields.

42
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:07,202
We live in tough times, my son.
People are upset.

43
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,280
Perhaps you should stop to take
this pregnant woman with us.

44
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,230
OK

45
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,114
Good lady, do you want to come on board?

46
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:16,937
Thank you, my feet are still strong.

47
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:20,947
- Why don't you take me instead?
- But my girl, she is pregnant.

48
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,842
Who knows, maybe I am too.

49
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:27,173
Go away. Leave the people
to go to their jobs.

50
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:36,044
Come on guys, hang on.
We are almost there.

51
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:32,616
- What's the matter, folks?
- Where do you come from?

52
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,991
- From far away.
- How far?

53
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,673
- From Anapli.
- Don't lie, or you will regret it.

54
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:42,119
Your face is that of a hungry dog.

55
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:45,712
You are one of those rebels who were
banished elsewhere and now come here!

56
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,375
I told you, I come from Anapli.

57
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,632
- And where do you go?
- Wherever I want to!

58
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,088
Get out of my way!

59
00:07:58,236 --> 00:07:59,697
You go ahead.

60
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:31,848
Back! Back, you damned lot.

61
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:34,504
Back. Stay still.

62
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,377
What are you doing there?
Why are you not letting the people pass?

63
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:38,960
And why should we report to you?

64
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,871
Have you heard of Hormovas,
the master of these plains?

65
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:42,295
We are his caretakers.

66
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:46,766
And I am his younger son, Odysseas.
Move it.

67
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,736
I said move it!

68
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,218
Let me wring it for you.

69
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,355
Come on, old man.

70
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,876
Is it true that you are
the son of Hormovas?

71
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:09,516
Why?

72
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:14,861
My father admired you.
He said that this kid has a big heart.

73
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:18,302
-Your father?
 - He was killed during the uprising.

74
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,346
You had fought together.

75
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,491
I am the daughter of Captain Zisis.

76
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:56,071
<i>Prayers in Greek.

77
00:11:56,336 --> 00:12:03,243
<i>Prayers in Greek.

78
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:11,254
<i>Prayers in Greek.

79
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:18,818
My dear Christians, the prodigal son
had all God's blessings:

80
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:22,973
a rich and well-respected father,
a beloved brother,

81
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,574
a large portion of land.

82
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:32,673
He turned against
his father and brother.

83
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,526
He stole from his own home and left.

84
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:43,201
But after a while, his soul was yearning
for his paternal home.

85
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:47,706
He thirsted for his father's forgiveness
and that's why he went back

86
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:53,007
and embraced his father's knees.
And his father willingly forgave him.

87
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,075
Because my dear Christians,

88
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:58,285
the beauty of remorse
and the power of apology,

89
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,374
is the deepest truth of God's command.

90
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,425
I am back, father.

91
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:24,181
I have been longing for this moment
for years my son.

92
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,092
To have you next to me.

93
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,828
Father, does Rigas know that I'm back?

94
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:33,433
Haven't I told you? Your brother has
gone hunting in the mountains.

95
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,047
I thought he would be coming back today,
but don't worry.

96
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,201
We've started the feast now.
And another day, when he comes back,

97
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:44,686
we'll celebrate for both of you!
Aren't you drinking?

98
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:49,439
- Cheers.
- To your good health, father.

99
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,737
You've set up quite a feast, father.

100
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:41,578
If I knew it,
I wouldn't have gone hunting.

101
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,379
What's up? Is this a saint day again?

102
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,682
No, my son. We have other reasons
to celebrate.

103
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,576
Did a sterile filly gave birth?

104
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:51,488
Your brother is back, Rigas.
Don't you see him?

105
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,443
My father you're getting old
and you're losing your mind.

106
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,886
My brother died four years ago.
Did you forget?

107
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:02,247
Your brother is alive.
He's back and I forgave him.

108
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:04,203
And you ordered a feast for that.

109
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:09,752
And you brought dancers.
How many lambs did you slaughter?

110
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:12,186
- Six.
- Which calf?

111
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:15,213
The brown one, with the white dots.

112
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:31,689
- Are you touched to have your son back?
- Any father would be!

113
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,254
And you don't remember
what he did to you?

114
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,357
I forgot everything.

115
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,324
Then I will help you remember.

116
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:40,250
The ragged ones rose
against the landlords.

117
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:43,190
They threw the bread
that we fed them back at us

118
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,461
and they attacked with guns
to seize our land.

119
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,363
Do you remember when you
came home, pale as a ghost

120
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,911
and threw me a gun to save our land?

121
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,562
Do you remember the bullets
that they planted in my body?

122
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:57,627
Or the times we stayed awake,
dead from agony?

123
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:01,049
How many times have we come
face to face with death?

124
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:03,416
Do you remember all that, father?

125
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,412
How could I have forgotten, my son?

126
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:09,235
Then how could you forget what your
younger son did, that horrible year?

127
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:12,525
How could you forget that he threw away
the gun that you gave him?

128
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,556
That he refused to defend our land.

129
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:18,573
That in the end he extended his arm
to that swarm of bees

130
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,465
that fell upon us to destroy us.

131
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:24,235
And now that the one who betrayed us
is back from prison,

132
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:25,786
you forget everything!

133
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:28,769
You embrace him and bang the drum.

134
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,674
And slaughter the calf that I used to
feed with my own hands.

135
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:36,263
Is that right?
And if it is, then tell me

136
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:39,820
who was punished for what had happened?
He or I?

137
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,440
- What do you want, Rigas? Speak.
- I want him to leave.

138
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:48,102
You don't have a second son.
Neither do I have a brother.

139
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,841
Father, let me speak to him.

140
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:54,574
No! A thousand times no.
I am not dead yet.

141
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,957
There is no tombstone over my head.

142
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:59,469
I'm alive! I'm your master
and I speak now.

143
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,482
Take it.

144
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:01,839
I said, take it!

145
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:19,626
Are you strong enough? Then break it.

146
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:27,585
Now break both of them. Break them!

147
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:54,323
Listen, Rigas. I will soon be gone,
but the land will be still here.

148
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,462
And more enemies will surround you.

149
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:01,012
The days to come will be even harder.

150
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:05,123
Shake your brother's hand
and hold it tight.

151
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:09,466
You should always remember that
it is easy to break one stick alone.

152
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:13,537
Keep playing. Today we celebrate.

153
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:17,074
Play loud enough for those on the other
side of the plains to hear you.

154
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:20,637
Hormovas' other fawn is back home.

155
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,212
I know who you are
and where you come from.

156
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,524
You're from Petrohori village.

157
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,909
You were the first to attack
the masters who were feeding you.

158
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,076
That's why everyone is sending you away.

159
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:38,477
Half of you are imprisoned.

160
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,311
The other half are bandits
in the mountains.

161
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:44,119
And the ones that remained,
women, children and cripples,

162
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:46,165
come to me now, asking for bread.

163
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:48,784
We're not cripples or beggars.
It's harvest season. We want to work.

164
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:49,566
Then go somewhere else.

165
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,521
- We went but they sent us away.
- And why should I care? Move on.

166
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:54,910
And go to the mountains
to harvest rocks?

167
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:01,484
Shut up!

168
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:05,323
Listen, everyone.

169
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:09,499
If you've come to your senses and
ask for wages and nothing more,

170
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:12,033
then we may have something
to talk about.

171
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,009
Get me the pen.

172
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:54,848
Everyone who signs this paper
will get a job.

173
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,290
It says that the land belongs to me

174
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,618
and for as long as you live,
you won't have any claims on it.

175
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,239
It also says,

176
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,864
that you disapprove
of the workers's uprising

177
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:07,279
that tried to ravish our land.

178
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,213
And that those who took their rifles
against us

179
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:11,583
are common thieves and murderers.

180
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:17,173
Everyone who signs will get a job
for the whole harvest season.

181
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:21,662
Free food, a free place to sleep
and an additional wage.

182
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,748
Those who can't write may draw a cross.

183
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:29,148
Any interested ones may go ahead.

184
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,748
This paper

185
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,158
says that we consider our fathers
and brothers to be murderers,

186
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:55,254
who died four years ago
to get some land for themselves

187
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:58,083
and that we swear to have no claims
on the land.

188
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,819
Neither us nor our children.

189
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,434
Do you really want to sign such a paper?

190
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,132
What does this bastard want?

191
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,662
- Is this your lover?
- She's my sister.

192
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,000
A sweet sister you got there.

193
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,253
To conclude, if you agree with her,
then there are no jobs.

194
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:42,295
- Speak!
- Whatever Eirini says.

195
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,606
Aren't you ashamed to have a woman
as a leader?

196
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:48,335
She knows more than us.
She teaches our children.

197
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,464
- So you're a little teacher?
- I know how to write, that's all.

198
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:21,095
And what are you supposed to be?
A farmer?

199
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,874
Just a passerby.

200
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:30,390
- And what are you doing among them?
- I'm just curious. I wanted to see...

201
00:24:31,024 --> 00:24:32,301
See what?

202
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:38,156
Whether they will be able to find,
among all landlords,

203
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,988
even just one true human being.

204
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:46,531
I know your face, Marinos Antypas,

205
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:48,725
the islander who
leads Thessaly to unrest.

206
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:51,463
The beetle who wants to
light the big fire.

207
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,858
I told your father at Pyrgetos

208
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,282
that you shouldn't dare
to set foot on our land.

209
00:24:57,612 --> 00:25:01,503
- All masters send me the same message.
- And what do you do for that?

210
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:03,805
I go to the slaves...

211
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:05,940
Rigas!

212
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:16,143
- What is it, Odysseas Hormovas?
- Blood makes me sick, you know it.

213
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,445
Then stay in the kitchen,
in the company of women.

214
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:22,335
Someone who hits the hungry
and the weak is not a man.

215
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:24,836
This guy knows that he can beat you
without hitting you.

216
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:30,733
These people are desperate.
And desperation is like a river.

217
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:33,907
If it can't find a passage,
it rises and floods the fields.

218
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,267
And what do you want from me?

219
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,703
- Give bread to the ones that struck us?
- Yes,

220
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:39,683
for otherwise they will strike again.

221
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,429
Why do we want them here?
Let them leave.

222
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:42,765
We will find other workers.

223
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:43,657
Send them away.

224
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:44,985
-They will cause trouble.
- Shut up!

225
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:55,870
Listen up. I'm not a literate man and

226
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,143
what my educated brother just said
touched my soul.

227
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,164
These homeless folks ask for bread.
They can have it.

228
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:05,992
The ask for work. They can have it.

229
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,100
Come on you hungry, let's go together!

230
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:11,690
I don't want people to say
that I was afraid of you.

231
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:22,411
You are the son of a master,

232
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:25,475
you have your own land,
yet you extend your hand.

233
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,823
Are you crazy,
or are you so nice a person?

234
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:34,777
If you find the answer,
let me know as well,

235
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:37,635
because I wasn't able to find it.

236
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:32,369
Mother of God! What are you doing here?

237
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:34,508
Leave, can't you hear?

238
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,744
Leave, someone will see us.

239
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:44,434
Have you gone mad?

240
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,462
- What happened?
- Nothing.

241
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:17,004
- What do you want?
- I saw my sister and ran.

242
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,809
I called her to count how many of you
there are and give you food.

243
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:21,926
What would you eat, rocks?

244
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,288
That's some nice red wine.

245
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,754
Leave the wine and come over here.

246
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:28,601
Take a bag of beans and beat it.

247
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:39,426
What are you waiting for? I am not going
to eat your sister. Get lost.

248
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:42,031
Watch your tone with me.
I'm not scared of you.

249
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,766
Giagos, go on, beat it. Go.

250
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:06,838
He better start behaving
otherwise we'll have trouble.

251
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:09,442
Never mind him.
He's a little hot-tempered.

252
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:14,726
- Tell me, how many of you are there?
- 74. Forty of them are females.

253
00:30:16,036 --> 00:30:17,285
We also have two sick people.

254
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,347
- What's their illness?
- Fever.

255
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:22,150
What's your name?

256
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:25,692
Eirini.

257
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:30,560
- How many of the children are yours?
- None.

258
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:36,245
So you're free.
Why didn't you say so before?

259
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,479
Do you want something else?

260
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:44,221
You never thanked me
for what I did for you.

261
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:46,059
Thank you.

262
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:50,145
- Just like that?
- What else?

263
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:56,966
You have a sweet mouth.
And lightning bolts for eyes.

264
00:30:57,947 --> 00:30:59,543
OK, you can go now.

265
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:25,670
Why are you looking at me like that?

266
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,272
Yesterday, when you spoiled the feast,
my soul bled.

267
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,719
Why, did I say something wrong?

268
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:39,664
We are brothers, Rigas.
We used to have differences.

269
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:42,657
Now the storm is gone.
We need to forget them.

270
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:44,916
We have the same blood.

271
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:48,237
Do we?

272
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,448
When you spoiled the feast and
your veins were swollen from yelling,

273
00:31:58,932 --> 00:32:02,577
I said that we are not.
But I still believed.

274
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:05,313
When you said to the homeless,

275
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:07,424
<i>"Come on you homeless lot, join me"</i>,

276
00:32:08,978 --> 00:32:12,644
I said to myself,
<i>"Yes Odysseas, he is your brother,

277
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:15,917
<i>this is your real brother"</i>.

278
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,336
Down there you learned
how to talk a big talk,

279
00:32:27,937 --> 00:32:29,140
but don't hurry,

280
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,950
you are still to see
your real brother, Rigas.

281
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:01,889
I'm fed up.
I no longer want this life.

282
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:02,818
Stop it.

283
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:05,246
To meet once every six months,
on the run, scared to the bone.

284
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,168
What do you want me to do?
They have a price on my head.

285
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:09,224
- Surrender, Kotsos.
- They will put me in jail.

286
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,182
Let them put you. It will end sometime.

287
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,989
You will come back to us again
and live a normal life.

288
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,719
Forget about that. All my life, I was
digging other men's land,

289
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,433
I was eating at a dish
that was not my own,

290
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:22,647
I was drinking water
at the same pond as their horses,

291
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,882
I will not let them cage me, because
I yelled for a piece of land.

292
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:29,473
- You yelled, but also hit, Kotsos.
- I hit when they hit me,

293
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:32,762
I no longer wait to get hit.
I strike first.

294
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:19,125
Our child will be born soon, Kotsos.

295
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,331
What should I tell him about his father?

296
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,945
That he lives in the mountains
like a hunted beast?

297
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,739
That he sleeps next to night owls
and shivers to the wind's blow?

298
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:30,725
Tell him that he's dead.

299
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:08,959
<i>The nightingales are singing up in the,

300
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,957
<i>up in the ridges.

301
00:35:15,158 --> 00:35:21,608
<i>The nightingales are singing in the
branches that summer is here,

302
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:25,931
<i>that summer is here.

303
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:33,257
<i>Men are going to the fields,
to harvest the wheat,

304
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:37,170
<i>to harvest the wheat.

305
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:43,785
<i>To harvest the wheat
with their bare hands,

306
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,813
<i>with their bare hands.

307
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:54,323
<i>To celebrate St. John's day, to make

308
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:59,985
<i>beautiful girls look at them
and take pride in them.

309
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:32,201
- What are you doing here?
- I'm getting some sun.

310
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:33,749
Why aren't you working?

311
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:37,179
How much do you pay?

312
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,424
I pay as much as I want.
It's none of your business.

313
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,862
That's how it is.

314
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,589
You tell me a number
and if I don't like it, I don't work.

315
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:48,309
The Turks are gone and you say
that we're all equal now.

316
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,259
Shut up.

317
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:57,360
- Where did you find this thing?
- A Turk gave it to my father.

318
00:37:00,854 --> 00:37:02,431
Should I play a few notes?

319
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:10,006
I told you that you were going to have
a hard time with me.

320
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,137
Why?

321
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:13,821
If you won't work,
then you won't be eating.

322
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,537
And don't you dare step on my land,
or I'll cut your feet.

323
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:19,098
I would do you even worse,

324
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:22,056
if not for your sister's beautiful eyes.

325
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:27,206
And if I find out that
you are stealing wine from me,

326
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:29,340
I will hang you upside down.

327
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:15,881
I saw you from above and told them,
<i>"He reminds me of an old friend"</i>.

328
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:19,329
It is Odysseas Hormovas and
we need to welcome him.

329
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:28,048
- Do you remember me?
- Aren't you Kotsos?

330
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:35,861
They put you in jail and only
half of you is left, but I got away.

331
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,419
I see that.

332
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:40,466
What's wrong, aren't you
happy to see me?

333
00:38:40,745 --> 00:38:42,139
Not if you're carrying guns.

334
00:38:44,763 --> 00:38:46,256
You came with us once.

335
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,706
People were asking for
their rights then.

336
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,232
Now you're acting as thieves.

337
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:55,042
Sooner or later, I knew that you
would abide by the law.

338
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:59,784
You are a landlord. The law is the
barbed wire that guards your land.

339
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:05,293
But we, my friend, are outside the wire.

340
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:07,334
Your law is our enemy.

341
00:39:07,795 --> 00:39:09,926
That's why we had to make one
of our own.

342
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:19,110
This is our law.

343
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:22,362
It is easy to change a law.

344
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,460
What is difficult is to make it better.

345
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,721
- Where is the girl?
- What girl?

346
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:53,164
- The one that is your leader.
-She's carrying sheaves, at Pera Alonia.

347
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:09,465
- What's with her?
- She likes fooling around.

348
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,943
Hey, move on!

349
00:40:48,304 --> 00:40:50,848
- Are you looking for someone?
- You.

350
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,895
- What do you want?
- To help you.

351
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,500
You are the son of a noble woman,
but you became a bum.

352
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,296
Don't come closer.

353
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:08,271
What are you afraid of? We're alone.

354
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,778
Don't come closer, I told you!

355
00:41:49,377 --> 00:41:51,678
Odysseas, get out of my way.

356
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,115
Get out of my way, I said!

357
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,505
You're going the wrong way.

358
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:03,560
Go back, Rigas.

359
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,764
Once, I was fighting here
for half a day to save you.

360
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:10,247
You owe me your life.
Go before I take it from you.

361
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:11,484
Leave!

362
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:14,902
We are brothers and you know me well,

363
00:42:16,256 --> 00:42:17,632
I will not leave, Rigas.

364
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:27,771
Put the knife down, do you hear?

365
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,116
Put the knife down.

366
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:33,292
Get out of my way.

367
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,585
Get out of my way, I said!

368
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:24,921
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing, he didn't have the time.

369
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:34,022
He's worse than a wolf.

370
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:36,900
You are brothers, but he treats you
like an enemy.

371
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,640
- He has his reasons.
- I've heard about it...

372
00:44:42,356 --> 00:44:44,976
When the peasants rose,
you refused to hit them.

373
00:44:46,707 --> 00:44:49,102
Someone like you
couldn't have done differently.

374
00:44:49,152 --> 00:44:50,406
Pull the reins.

375
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:23,727
I actually tried back then...

376
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:26,567
You tried to do what?

377
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:28,961
To hit them,

378
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,389
to take my father's rifle
and defend the ranch,

379
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:37,808
our land, as Rigas would have called it.

380
00:45:39,423 --> 00:45:40,770
How do you call it?

381
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:44,578
I don't know.

382
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:50,225
The sea feeds the people too,
but it belongs to everyone.

383
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:54,845
The sky brings rain, it gives the sun,

384
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:59,640
but no one thought about putting
barbed wire around them.

385
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,508
Everyone tells me that
I am the son of a a nobleman

386
00:46:10,641 --> 00:46:13,950
and I hear a voice inside
that tells me, <i>"Odysseas,

387
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:17,102
<i>you are foremost a human"</i>.

388
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:22,769
Are you leaving?

389
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:25,664
Do you want something?

390
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,027
To thank you, for everything
that you are doing for us.

391
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:36,101
If it weren't for you, I don't know
what would have happened.

392
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:39,215
I would never let someone
disgrace you like that.

393
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,333
You are courageous.
I admired you from the beginning.

394
00:46:44,103 --> 00:46:45,479
I grit my teeth.

395
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:51,149
These people need to live.
Children need to eat bread.

396
00:46:51,673 --> 00:46:53,910
And the elders need to forget
the ones they lost.

397
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,687
Did you manage to forget?

398
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:00,687
My father was the most
precious thing that I had.

399
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:03,398
He was taking me by the hand,

400
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:05,978
taking me to a hill
and showed me the land.

401
00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:10,392
<i>"Someday we'll have a piece of our own",
</i>he was telling me.

402
00:47:11,854 --> 00:47:14,059
<i>"We'll pick up stones and build a home.

403
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:16,891
<i>My grandchildren will play
on their own land"</i>.

404
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:19,566
You better forget that,

405
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:22,681
if you give up the fight
that your father started.

406
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,215
Shouldn't you be harvesting?

407
00:49:10,555 --> 00:49:11,499
Yes, I should...

408
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:15,271
- Why aren't you there?
- There's too much sun in the fields.

409
00:49:16,439 --> 00:49:19,531
- And what are you doing here?
- It's cool in here.

410
00:49:20,984 --> 00:49:23,709
I'm alone.
I don't have a home of my own.

411
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:26,142
I came to rest for noon.

412
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:30,922
- Without a dress?
-Who should I be ashamed of, the horses?

413
00:49:32,422 --> 00:49:35,548
- Didn't you know that I was coming?
- No.

414
00:49:40,075 --> 00:49:42,220
No, or maybe yes?

415
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,240
Yes.

416
00:49:52,376 --> 00:49:54,005
- Say it again.
- Yes.

417
00:49:56,052 --> 00:49:58,598
- Why are you here?
- I told you, I can't stand the sun.

418
00:49:58,648 --> 00:50:00,784
- Just for that?
- I'm tired of the land.

419
00:50:01,024 --> 00:50:05,254
The rake fills my hands with blisters.
I wasn't born to live like that.

420
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,525
Who is it?

421
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:13,105
The old man sent me.
He's waiting for you to have lunch.

422
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:15,554
I'm busy. Tell him to eat without me.

423
00:50:15,674 --> 00:50:17,443
He won't eat alone. You know it.

424
00:50:18,425 --> 00:50:20,162
OK, I'm coming. Go now.

425
00:50:36,229 --> 00:50:39,557
When the sun bothers you again
and you come to the stable,

426
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:41,541
let me know.

427
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:22,152
Hello, father.

428
00:51:22,362 --> 00:51:24,465
You should say,
"Hello father and brother".

429
00:51:24,786 --> 00:51:26,082
Your brother is also here.

430
00:51:27,397 --> 00:51:30,129
Father, I'm not hungry at all.
I'm leaving.

431
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:33,707
Come here.
There are three chairs at the table

432
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:35,635
for Hormovas and his two sons.

433
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:39,405
As long as you're both alive,
I won't eat next to an empty chair.

434
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:40,601
Sit.

435
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,498
Your face is swollen. What happened?

436
00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:00,645
- I fell off the horse.
- Don't lie.

437
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:04,148
No horse has been born
that could drop you off its back.

438
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:07,098
You fought with a man. Who was it?

439
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,695
I am asking you, Odysseas. Who was it?

440
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:15,449
Me, father.

441
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:19,509
What happened?

442
00:52:20,966 --> 00:52:23,257
- Nothing.
- Tell me, what happened!

443
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:30,066
He called me a coward.
I got angry and attacked him.

444
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:35,264
The blood in men's veins is boiling.

445
00:52:35,867 --> 00:52:37,876
You are brothers, but also men.

446
00:52:38,437 --> 00:52:41,545
You fought like men,
but now you will make up like brothers.

447
00:52:41,665 --> 00:52:43,224
Always together!

448
00:52:46,419 --> 00:52:49,715
Rigas! How dare you do that
in front of me?

449
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:50,962
Father, I respect you,

450
00:52:51,214 --> 00:52:53,233
 but I cannot drink wine
with this coward.

451
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:54,183
Rigas,

452
00:52:55,114 --> 00:52:57,830
- Take that back.
- I say it again to your face.

453
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,777
- You are unmanly and a traitor.
- Stop it!

454
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:03,258
-Odysseas, stay calm. I said, stay calm.
 -Stay calm again?

455
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,178
Stay calm for how long?

456
00:53:06,198 --> 00:53:09,817
Ever since I got here,
I've been trying to stay calm.

457
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:11,921
To forget what happened.

458
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:15,735
I came back and he is not embracing me.

459
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:18,345
And I say to myself,
 <i>"He is your brother, Odysseas"</i>.

460
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:23,249
He insults me. He sends me away
and declares me an enemy,

461
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:26,059
And I say to myself,
<i>"He is your brother, Odysseas"</i>.

462
00:53:26,646 --> 00:53:28,880
He hits helpless people.

463
00:53:29,117 --> 00:53:33,755
He lashes out at poor and weak
women and I am ashamed.

464
00:53:34,368 --> 00:53:37,393
I am deeply ashamed and say to myself,

465
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,207
<i>"He is your brother, Odysseas"</i>.

466
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,249
Say to your older son, father,

467
00:53:46,644 --> 00:53:50,555
that I am the son
and brother of landlords, a squire.

468
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,399
But that doesn't stop me
from being human.

469
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,926
And also tell him not to
go over the edge.

470
00:53:58,136 --> 00:54:01,056
Because someday I will say
to myself for the first time,

471
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:06,426
<i>"This guy, Odysseas,
is not your brother"</i>.

472
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:14,995
Rigas,

473
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:19,977
you tried to break two bonded sticks,
but you couldn't do so.

474
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:23,538
It's a shame because
difficult times are ahead.

475
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:26,183
The fire is burning again.

476
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:29,695
Workers are getting ready
for a new uprising.

477
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:35,551
This happened in 1828 at Morias.

478
00:54:36,337 --> 00:54:39,647
It also happened in 1864 at Eptanisa.

479
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:44,491
The state was forced to
give big estates to the landless.

480
00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:47,355
And the same will happen
here in Thessaly,

481
00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:49,903
as long as you believe in it.

482
00:54:50,451 --> 00:54:53,862
And to that end,
you all have to fight together.

483
00:54:53,982 --> 00:54:57,430
You tell us to fight, but how?
Like the last time when they bashed us?

484
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,079
This failure was useful.
It taught you what to avoid.

485
00:55:02,422 --> 00:55:06,079
It taught you not to rise separately
and at random.

486
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,085
You were patient for generations.
You can be for a little longer.

487
00:55:10,227 --> 00:55:14,432
But when the time comes,
the whole of Thessaly will rise.

488
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:17,609
Then you will get the land either by law

489
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:20,263
or with your own hands and blood.

490
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:22,611
Eirini, Eirini.

491
00:55:23,983 --> 00:55:24,883
What happened?

492
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:26,552
The pregnant woman is
about to give birth.

493
00:55:26,672 --> 00:55:30,991
May she have a healthy delivery!

494
00:56:02,465 --> 00:56:03,671
How long has she been trying?

495
00:56:03,721 --> 00:56:06,111
About an hour and a half. Get in there.
She's asking for you.

496
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,465
Listen to him.
He cries for land already.

497
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:51,786
Someone is coming.

498
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:59,141
A bandit.

499
00:56:59,261 --> 00:57:01,215
He's on the ranch and coming this way.

500
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,923
Go that way. Back, back!

501
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,899
Put the rifle down.

502
00:57:30,711 --> 00:57:31,775
Move it now.

503
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:49,621
- What do you want?
- My wife just gave birth.

504
00:58:34,147 --> 00:58:36,701
- A boy or a girl?
- A boy.

505
00:59:10,825 --> 00:59:11,725
Kotsos,

506
00:59:13,127 --> 00:59:14,717
Kotsos stay with us.

507
00:59:34,499 --> 00:59:36,509
He was born in the fields,
under the sun.

508
00:59:37,513 --> 00:59:40,377
Let's hope that his children
will be born under a roof.

509
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:55,475
Move on, without causing trouble.

510
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:37,390
Work! Everybody back to work!

511
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:38,618
Fast!

512
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,373
Close the tap.

513
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,974
That's my boy.
Last time you forgot it open.

514
01:02:34,979 --> 01:02:36,561
- Move it.
- Where are you taking me?

515
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,149
For a walk.
It's well suited for friends of bandits.

516
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:41,462
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

517
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:42,543
Move it.

518
01:02:48,337 --> 01:02:50,752
Harder! Harder!

519
01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:54,168
Hit him! Harder!

520
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:00,106
Shut up!

521
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:06,314
I hired you because

522
01:03:06,462 --> 01:03:08,926
 I didn't want people to think that
I'm scared of you.

523
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,096
But now you are scaring me.

524
01:03:11,716 --> 01:03:15,481
I give you bread!
And you try to take mine away.

525
01:03:16,307 --> 01:03:18,328
Her husband is a bandit.

526
01:03:18,676 --> 01:03:21,990
And this bastard brought him
to my ranch.

527
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,790
- In my own home!
- He is lying.

528
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,748
- Shut up, you bastard!
- Shame on you, Rigas.

529
01:03:28,663 --> 01:03:30,068
Shame on all of you.

530
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:33,422
You're brutalizing a new mother
and a young kid.

531
01:03:33,422 --> 01:03:34,268
What kid?

532
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:36,856
He's a snitch for the bandits.
He stole from me.

533
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:38,677
Just two sips of wine,

534
01:03:38,874 --> 01:03:41,215
and a piece of bread that even
your dogs wouldn't eat.

535
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:44,398
Your brother is a thief
and a ruffian on my ranch.

536
01:03:45,018 --> 01:03:49,064
And whoever does the same,
or helps him over the next day,

537
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:54,341
tell him that he's digging his own grave
be it a man or a woman.

538
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,973
Get back to your work. I said, leave!

539
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:12,503
- What's going on, Rigas?
- I caught him stealing.

540
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:16,327
And one of the bandits that were here
is her husband.

541
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:29,753
Rigas, stay calm.

542
01:04:30,093 --> 01:04:32,468
Violence is a bad seed,
for it brings violence.

543
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:38,938
Cut the ropes. What do you want, Rigas?

544
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:10,376
And you should know
that I don't have only one son.

545
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,071
Whatever complaints you may have,
he is my son too.

546
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:26,609
Help this woman here.

547
01:05:51,978 --> 01:05:54,659
Do you know what gets me
wondering about you?

548
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:55,905
What?

549
01:05:56,096 --> 01:06:00,088
How can both of you have come
out of the same belly?

550
01:06:00,138 --> 01:06:01,038
Shut it.

551
01:06:02,395 --> 01:06:03,981
Never say that again, you hear me?

552
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:35,914
Did you get angry at what Giagos said?

553
01:06:36,890 --> 01:06:38,355
Rigas is my brother.

554
01:06:40,055 --> 01:06:42,299
I'm sorry that you once fought
with him for me.

555
01:06:43,045 --> 01:06:44,369
That was the right thing to do.

556
01:06:45,261 --> 01:06:46,895
If needed, I would do it again.

557
01:06:50,287 --> 01:06:51,630
I'm getting scared.

558
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,390
I'm thinking about taking Giagos
and leaving.

559
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,095
This might best for everyone.

560
01:06:58,184 --> 01:07:00,634
The day I saved you at the river
from my brother's arms,

561
01:07:01,836 --> 01:07:04,418
you told me about your father
who died fighting for you,

562
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:08,714
for your future children
and for everyone else.

563
01:07:12,339 --> 01:07:13,559
Do you remember what I told you then?

564
01:07:14,787 --> 01:07:17,191
Not to give up this fight.

565
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:25,383
We can't stay here, Odysseas.
Your brother has respect for nothing.

566
01:07:27,364 --> 01:07:29,586
It's not just my brother here.
There's also me.

567
01:07:29,706 --> 01:07:31,321
I don't want to stand in between.

568
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:34,775
You have the same strength as him.

569
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:41,584
- I'm scared more of you.
- Why?

570
01:07:42,439 --> 01:07:43,339
Because...

571
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:47,519
Because I can't fight you.

572
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:51,118
What are you afraid of?

573
01:07:53,879 --> 01:07:55,945
What I see in your eyes
when you're looking at me.

574
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,630
What I also feel inside.

575
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:02,420
We shouldn't fool ourselves,
Odysseas Hormovas.

576
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:05,518
You're a nobleman and I'm no one.

577
01:08:08,254 --> 01:08:10,226
Thank you for everything
that you have done for us.

578
01:08:12,094 --> 01:08:13,784
I came to tell you
that tomorrow I'm leaving.

579
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:17,099
Listen Eirini,

580
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:19,747
there's nothing keeping me here either.

581
01:08:20,986 --> 01:08:22,723
But I stay because I have to.

582
01:08:23,888 --> 01:08:25,287
And so do you.

583
01:08:26,498 --> 01:08:28,932
All these people need you.
Can you feel it?

584
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:30,660
I do.

585
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,796
Give me your hand

586
01:08:35,843 --> 01:08:37,969
and swear that you will not
give up on them.

587
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:40,739
Do you promise?

588
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:42,579
Yes, Odysseas.

589
01:08:44,851 --> 01:08:45,969
Go now.

590
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,352
- What are you doing here?
- Don't get scared.

591
01:09:54,672 --> 01:09:56,953
- Leave.
- I told you, don't get scared.

592
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:58,841
I won't come on to you this time.

593
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:02,267
I want to tell you some true words.
Like a man.

594
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:03,353
What do you want, Rigas?

595
01:10:03,473 --> 01:10:05,381
All my life, I've been
struggling with the land.

596
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:07,757
I never read or travelled.

597
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,076
So I don't know how to say nice words.

598
01:10:11,062 --> 01:10:14,379
You have fallen down,
but you hold your head up high.

599
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:15,786
I want you.

600
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:18,111
Ever since my mother died,
my home is empty.

601
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:21,168
- You're looking for a maid?
- I'm looking for a woman.

602
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:23,561
A mother for my future children.

603
01:10:25,063 --> 01:10:26,359
Rigas Hormovas,

604
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,138
this is the first time that you treat me
as a man would.

605
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:33,910
I'm aware of who you are and what I am.
It is an honor for me.

606
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,295
But I cannot say, "I do".

607
01:10:37,127 --> 01:10:40,479
- Do you love somebody else?
- There's nothing more to say.

608
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:42,995
Farewell, Rigas.

609
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:46,342
Once you called me a bum.
And today I talked to you like a man.

610
01:10:47,177 --> 01:10:51,093
Just know that whatever I have wanted,
 I just grabbed it with my hand.

611
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:54,111
I wish I could lose both my hands.

612
01:11:59,072 --> 01:12:00,443
You did well to come here.

613
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:04,095
It's time we gathered to
make a decision together.

614
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:07,064
- We can't bear it any longer.
- What's wrong?

615
01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:10,153
- That damned guy from Kefallonia.
- Antypas?

616
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:11,806
- Yes.
- Him again?

617
01:12:11,926 --> 01:12:15,356
Yes, him. A few days ago he was
at my ranch.

618
01:12:15,628 --> 01:12:17,309
Now he's at Hormovas' land.

619
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:20,446
Tomorrow he'll be somewhere else.

620
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:25,573
He roams with a can of oil
and he spills it all over Thessaly.

621
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:29,491
Then he will light a match
and burn all of us.

622
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,740
What are you suggesting?

623
01:12:38,468 --> 01:12:39,567
Is there someone for the job?

624
01:12:39,617 --> 01:12:41,751
Yes, he's trustworthy,
but he wants a lot.

625
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:23,736
Come on in, come on in,
just two dimes per person,

626
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,919
an exotic presence,
an exotic world dancer,

627
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:31,756
an exotic dancer from the Balkans...

628
01:13:34,599 --> 01:13:37,820
<i>Paris, Rome, New York

629
01:13:57,205 --> 01:14:02,782
It's not a boa, nor a rattler.
It's a fox from Siberia.

630
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:46,873
... the whole of the land
and leave nothing for you,

631
01:14:46,993 --> 01:14:49,707
for your sweat that waters their land.

632
01:14:49,827 --> 01:14:51,162
Nobody move!

633
01:14:53,049 --> 01:14:55,772
- You're here again?
- As you can see...

634
01:14:56,582 --> 01:14:59,108
Beating you didn't make you any wiser?

635
01:14:59,896 --> 01:15:01,699
Not in the way you mean it.

636
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:04,518
There are worse things than beating.

637
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:09,316
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- I know.

638
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:11,431
You're threatening me with death.

639
01:15:11,551 --> 01:15:14,567
I'm not threatening you.
I'm trying to bring you to your senses.

640
01:15:15,822 --> 01:15:17,024
What are you doing here?

641
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:20,715
What I always do.
I talk to them about the land.

642
01:15:21,138 --> 01:15:22,124
And what are you telling them?

643
01:15:22,244 --> 01:15:25,791
That  sooner or later
this land will be theirs.

644
01:15:26,213 --> 01:15:28,711
Maybe that will convince you
that it will never be theirs.

645
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:33,023
You've already tried to persuade me
in that way, but to no avail.

646
01:15:33,143 --> 01:15:35,126
But this time I will persuade you.

647
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:39,187
Beetle, eat from this land
and see how it tastes!

648
01:15:39,307 --> 01:15:44,417
Eat it and taste it to see how
it grew out of Hormovas' blood.

649
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,584
Move away and stop beating them.

650
01:15:55,866 --> 01:15:57,953
You disgrace yourself and
become the only one to lose.

651
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:00,394
Let me talk to him.

652
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,466
- So, you are Antypas?
- Yes I am.

653
01:16:11,212 --> 01:16:15,391
Do you know that leading people
to revolt is prohibited by law?

654
01:16:15,746 --> 01:16:16,646
Speak.

655
01:16:16,696 --> 01:16:18,613
Beating is also prohibited, old man.

656
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,698
And so is feeding one dirt,

657
01:16:21,102 --> 01:16:23,487
and exploitation, and low wages,

658
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:25,609
and raping women in the fields.

659
01:16:31,594 --> 01:16:34,929
Is it true that you tell the workers
that they should take the land?

660
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,983
- Yes?
- How then?

661
01:16:37,533 --> 01:16:39,279
Greece has a constitution,

662
01:16:39,693 --> 01:16:43,533
and the Greek constitution article 17
is about the land.

663
01:16:43,946 --> 01:16:45,289
Do you know what is stated there?

664
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:48,504
Nobody shall be deprived
of his property.

665
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:52,403
Can you hear me? Nobody!

666
01:16:52,929 --> 01:16:57,032
Old Hormovas, that is not the whole
of article 17.

667
01:16:57,239 --> 01:16:58,328
Let me fill the gaps.

668
01:16:59,004 --> 01:17:02,802
In case of public need,
one may be deprived of his property.

669
01:17:03,128 --> 01:17:06,236
Do you understand what public need is?

670
01:17:06,507 --> 01:17:09,794
That nobody shall be deprived
of his property,

671
01:17:09,914 --> 01:17:12,658
unless it is needed for the common good,

672
01:17:12,778 --> 01:17:16,208
unless it should benefit the people
and the nation.

673
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:20,015
God bless you, Antypas.

674
01:17:21,576 --> 01:17:25,229
And redistributing Thessaly's land,
will indeed benefit the people.

675
01:17:25,576 --> 01:17:26,863
Because only then,

676
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:29,532
only then, after the Turks have gone,

677
01:17:29,652 --> 01:17:32,893
will Thessaly's farmers
no longer be slaves.

678
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:36,426
And since redistribution
will benefit the people,

679
01:17:36,717 --> 01:17:38,613
it will also benefit the nation.

680
01:17:38,933 --> 01:17:43,483
Because happy nations with hungry people
do not exist!

681
01:17:43,647 --> 01:17:46,156
- Free the nations!
- Way to go, Antypas!

682
01:17:54,332 --> 01:17:55,571
Shut up!

683
01:18:02,905 --> 01:18:03,818
Leave.

684
01:18:04,656 --> 01:18:05,923
Go your own way.

685
01:18:07,091 --> 01:18:08,485
You are free.

686
01:18:44,485 --> 01:18:45,442
Antypas!

687
01:18:46,408 --> 01:18:47,413
Antypas,

688
01:18:48,522 --> 01:18:49,762
for your own sake,

689
01:18:49,987 --> 01:18:52,043
- don't go towards the well.
- Why?

690
01:18:52,252 --> 01:18:55,473
I saw an armed guy roaming there.

691
01:18:55,895 --> 01:18:59,455
I didn't like his face.
He looks like a murderer.

692
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,408
Maybe it's time.

693
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:05,302
Time for what?

694
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:07,312
Nothing.

695
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:12,168
- Which way  leads to the well?
 - That way.

696
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:19,273
Farewell, my girl. Thank you.

697
01:19:23,329 --> 01:19:25,751
Antypas, what are you going to do?

698
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:30,516
Sometimes one's death may offer more

699
01:19:30,636 --> 01:19:33,303
than his life. Goodbye.

700
01:19:56,819 --> 01:19:58,596
Did you happen to see Odysseas?

701
01:19:58,716 --> 01:19:59,807
No I didn't.

702
01:21:58,074 --> 01:22:00,440
I told him about the murderer
and he went straight at him.

703
01:22:09,837 --> 01:22:10,917
Where are you going?

704
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:11,072
Ah, you're here.

705
01:25:11,122 --> 01:25:13,260
Let's not be seen.
No one knows I'm leaving.

706
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,552
Hand over your bundle.

707
01:25:15,682 --> 01:25:18,031
It's OK that I don't have
any new clothes?

708
01:25:18,081 --> 01:25:19,813
 Only the ones you got me.

709
01:25:19,863 --> 01:25:23,906
In Athens you will live like a queen.
Don't you want that?

710
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:26,193
- Of course I want it.
- Come on then.

711
01:26:16,747 --> 01:26:18,531
The ones that paid him gave him little,

712
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,557
too little for such a murder.

713
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:56,031
That man who will soon be
under the earth,

714
01:26:57,655 --> 01:26:58,810
is not an ordinary man.

715
01:26:59,563 --> 01:27:01,779
If he were ordinary and not rare,

716
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:05,441
if he were little and not great,

717
01:27:07,009 --> 01:27:09,535
if he were a coward and not courageous,

718
01:27:10,812 --> 01:27:11,882
then he would still be alive.

719
01:27:14,408 --> 01:27:15,864
But he chose to die.

720
01:27:17,744 --> 01:27:20,251
And all of us are here
to mourn him and honor him.

721
01:27:21,218 --> 01:27:24,788
The people, but also
the honorable masters,

722
01:27:25,023 --> 01:27:27,230
the respectable leaders of these lands.

723
01:27:29,925 --> 01:27:34,125
That man gave his life for a dream,

724
01:27:35,509 --> 01:27:37,857
to see Thessaly happy again one day ,

725
01:27:39,436 --> 01:27:41,249
to see its children full,

726
01:27:42,017 --> 01:27:43,529
its mothers laughing,

727
01:27:45,056 --> 01:27:48,567
and its farmers working their own land.

728
01:27:49,516 --> 01:27:52,239
And now that he is no longer among us,

729
01:27:53,338 --> 01:27:56,352
will his dream, which is also
your dream, fade away?

730
01:27:57,706 --> 01:28:00,044
Will your children forget
that they are starving?

731
01:28:00,971 --> 01:28:03,299
Will your women stop
giving birth to slaves?

732
01:28:04,388 --> 01:28:06,013
Or will you, the men,

733
01:28:06,491 --> 01:28:09,825
stop asking for, in fear of death,
a piece of land to feed yourselves?

734
01:28:10,031 --> 01:28:12,184
Our fields, or our graves!

735
01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:22,320
A hut and a graveyard brothers!

736
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,348
A hut for our children,

737
01:28:24,468 --> 01:28:26,358
a graveyard for our bones.

738
01:28:26,658 --> 01:28:30,536
This is why God is with us
and He sends me to bless this fight.

739
01:28:30,656 --> 01:28:32,989
Long live father Dimitris
with your workers from Kalfaki.

740
01:28:33,109 --> 01:28:34,895
Fight our oppressors, brothers!

741
01:28:35,015 --> 01:28:38,463
I am Thymios Bazis. You know me.
I am the shoemaker.

742
01:28:38,691 --> 01:28:41,658
From you poor peasants,
I have nothing to gain.

743
01:28:41,778 --> 01:28:44,137
You're always barefoot,
even in the grave.

744
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:47,529
But I'm with you, a peasant among you,

745
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:49,369
ready to live and to die.

746
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:51,473
We want justice!

747
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:57,341
No rifles, my brothers! No rifles.

748
01:28:58,383 --> 01:28:59,463
Nor blood.

749
01:29:00,989 --> 01:29:03,224
We should only tell him one thing,
before he's gone forever.

750
01:29:04,716 --> 01:29:07,345
That his words are now
a seed on this land,

751
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:10,799
and the spring he was dreaming of
will soon be here.

752
01:29:47,230 --> 01:29:52,047
<i>The sun will not come out

753
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:57,127
<i>this dawn.

754
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:00,023
<i>The moon will not come out

755
01:30:00,502 --> 01:30:04,634
<i>tonight. 

756
01:30:07,768 --> 01:30:13,777
<i>Now that you have fallen
to the ground, oh eagle,

757
01:30:14,735 --> 01:30:18,972
<i>oh valiant eagle,

758
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:21,470
<i>oh valiant eagle,

759
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:28,590
<i>valiant eagle

760
01:30:32,613 --> 01:30:36,369
<i>A sour river

761
01:30:36,913 --> 01:30:40,237
<i>is what life is.

762
01:30:41,129 --> 01:30:47,159
<i>It will take our pain away.

763
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:53,780
<i>Our tears, our sorrows,

764
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:59,048
<i>oh valiant eagle,

765
01:30:59,168 --> 01:31:06,136
<i>oh valiant eagle.

766
01:31:11,908 --> 01:31:17,218
<i>Tonight, it will come out

767
01:31:18,469 --> 01:31:20,197
<i>it will come out,

768
01:31:20,657 --> 01:31:24,882
<i>the moon will come out tonight.

769
01:31:27,645 --> 01:31:32,185
<i>The sun will flash this dawn,

770
01:31:32,305 --> 01:31:38,509
<i>oh valiant eagle,

771
01:31:39,589 --> 01:31:45,344
<i>oh valiant eagle.

772
01:32:12,663 --> 01:32:14,550
Who is in command of the workers here?

773
01:32:15,575 --> 01:32:18,635
- I am.
- Then I shall speak with you.

774
01:32:19,217 --> 01:32:23,194
- I'm listening.
- Harvest season is over.

775
01:32:23,701 --> 01:32:26,518
Tell them to pack their things
tomorrow morning.

776
01:32:26,865 --> 01:32:29,750
They will be paid their share
and they will leave from my land.

777
01:32:30,013 --> 01:32:32,238
- Do you agree?
- I agree.

778
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,143
Anything more?

779
01:32:34,821 --> 01:32:37,169
That chair by the table...

780
01:32:38,145 --> 01:32:41,837
I want to know what to do with it.
Should I keep it or burn it?

781
01:32:41,957 --> 01:32:43,030
Burn it.

782
01:32:43,518 --> 01:32:46,288
Can you at least tell me why?

783
01:32:47,305 --> 01:32:50,874
I'd rather not, father.
I already said enough at the funeral.

784
01:32:57,559 --> 01:33:00,272
Odysseas, only tell me...

785
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:02,919
Do you think that I am a killer?

786
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:05,182
For Antypas' death? No.

787
01:33:06,097 --> 01:33:07,768
Is there another death?

788
01:33:08,153 --> 01:33:09,984
- Yes, father.
- Which one?

789
01:33:10,933 --> 01:33:13,844
The daily death from suffering
and misfortune of these people.

790
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:18,616
It is a crime, taking place each day
in poor men's huts.

791
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:22,034
You are a human and a Christian.

792
01:33:22,869 --> 01:33:25,288
Luke 3:11 says to give
one of your two shirts.

793
01:33:25,795 --> 01:33:27,541
You never happened to hear that parable?

794
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,476
I'm going blind, please,
I'm going blind.

795
01:33:57,526 --> 01:34:00,110
Stop it and don't be afraid of the soap.

796
01:34:00,326 --> 01:34:02,298
It hurts my eyes, I'm telling you.

797
01:34:02,418 --> 01:34:04,805
If it didn't hurt,
then it wouldn't kill lice.

798
01:34:05,782 --> 01:34:07,463
Go get dressed now, go on.

799
01:34:10,024 --> 01:34:11,302
What are you waiting for?

800
01:34:11,874 --> 01:34:13,459
Turn around.

801
01:34:14,171 --> 01:34:15,767
Someone's becoming a young man here.

802
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:24,501
Is everyone dressed up?
Go have lunch now.

803
01:34:30,821 --> 01:34:33,967
Now that you've become a man,
learn how to clean yourself.

804
01:34:34,226 --> 01:34:37,433
My mom is alive and you're lying,
saying she's dead.

805
01:34:37,553 --> 01:34:41,984
I will look for her and go back
to the village. You are lying to me.

806
01:34:58,004 --> 01:34:59,404
I'm worried about this child.

807
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,127
He won't accept that his mother is dead.

808
01:35:02,631 --> 01:35:04,357
He'll get older and he'll forget it.

809
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,634
Little kids never forget.

810
01:35:06,722 --> 01:35:08,306
Do older men forget?

811
01:35:08,783 --> 01:35:10,473
I brought something to eat. Come on.

812
01:35:12,437 --> 01:35:14,839
Father invited me back home again.

813
01:35:16,351 --> 01:35:19,208
Odysseas, I'm scared for you.

814
01:35:20,569 --> 01:35:23,489
- What are you scared of?
- You're a great man. All admire you.

815
01:35:24,903 --> 01:35:26,847
But now you've gone a step too far.

816
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:28,353
What do you mean?

817
01:35:30,847 --> 01:35:32,612
One's roots are at home,

818
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:36,258
and a man, just like a tree,
can't live without roots.

819
01:35:38,004 --> 01:35:39,985
You were born the son
and brother of a nobleman.

820
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:42,487
You need to go back.

821
01:35:43,999 --> 01:35:45,511
Your father never went back.

822
01:35:45,708 --> 01:35:47,276
My father had no other way.

823
01:35:47,396 --> 01:35:50,581
Didn't Antypas have another way?
He had a home back there.

824
01:35:51,464 --> 01:35:53,333
He could have lived
a peaceful life in his homeland.

825
01:35:53,793 --> 01:35:56,065
But he came here to die for everyone.

826
01:35:57,154 --> 01:36:00,871
You warned him, yet he went
where his heart told him to go.

827
01:36:02,008 --> 01:36:03,425
All this means nothing to you?

828
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:06,659
Listen Eirini, that's the only way.

829
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:10,203
I will stay with you
and seek to find new roots.

830
01:36:10,323 --> 01:36:11,977
You think you're capable of that?

831
01:36:13,358 --> 01:36:14,625
If I'm near you, yes.

832
01:36:15,452 --> 01:36:17,076
- Odysseas...
- Say no more.

833
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:22,843
We will find our own hill,
get some stones and build a house,

834
01:36:23,706 --> 01:36:24,946
with our own hands.

835
01:36:26,007 --> 01:36:28,930
And you will hold your own children,
not those of others.

836
01:36:31,005 --> 01:36:31,905
Do you want it?

837
01:36:42,697 --> 01:36:44,368
I am the first among all men.

838
01:36:45,298 --> 01:36:48,012
The sun needs half a day
to cross my land.

839
01:36:49,214 --> 01:36:52,012
She is a shoeless peasant

840
01:36:53,044 --> 01:36:54,030
and she said, "No" to me.

841
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:56,978
-That damn brother of yours intervened.
- Shut up, beat it.

842
01:36:57,098 --> 01:37:00,708
- Boss.
- Leave me alone, I said leave!

843
01:38:13,122 --> 01:38:16,747
My grandpa was a farmer,
just a regular man.

844
01:38:17,357 --> 01:38:20,204
He was telling me that for big animals
you have to wait near water.

845
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:23,453
- What's up?
- Hm, don't get scared.

846
01:38:24,157 --> 01:38:26,867
I would have laid you down,
but a good friend stopped me.

847
01:38:27,122 --> 01:38:29,085
He has a better idea about you.

848
01:38:38,782 --> 01:38:40,810
You're staring at me like a stupid fish.

849
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,223
You almost forgot me, right?

850
01:38:43,824 --> 01:38:45,574
But I'm the type that never forgets.

851
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:52,034
- Hand me the money.
- What money?

852
01:38:52,154 --> 01:38:55,415
The money you'll steal from the workers'
wages tomorrow. Give it to me.

853
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:02,984
Give it to me!

854
01:39:06,894 --> 01:39:10,068
- And the rest, there is more.
- I don't have any.

855
01:39:19,465 --> 01:39:21,578
All of your life
you were exploiting people.

856
01:39:21,627 --> 01:39:23,525
To multiply your money
and to fatten your ass.

857
01:39:23,575 --> 01:39:25,769
Now I will teach you what it's like
to be a peasant.

858
01:39:25,819 --> 01:39:26,775
Get off of me!

859
01:39:26,955 --> 01:39:29,081
You will pay for that, I swear.

860
01:39:31,102 --> 01:39:33,130
Bastard, you will pay for that one day.

861
01:39:33,798 --> 01:39:36,895
It's payback time.
You wanted to hang me, huh?

862
01:39:44,455 --> 01:39:46,032
Come on, come on!

863
01:40:39,314 --> 01:40:40,214
Enough.

864
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:14,208
The first time I saw you
you spoke of a law of yours.

865
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:16,608
Now I'm telling you to your face,

866
01:41:18,082 --> 01:41:20,655
your law is worse than the one
of my brother and father.

867
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:24,373
Because this is the old one,
which is destined to die.

868
01:41:25,082 --> 01:41:29,672
While yours is the new one and
that's why it should be less vulgar.

869
01:41:31,779 --> 01:41:34,174
Next time I meet you, don't hit me.

870
01:41:35,019 --> 01:41:36,671
Because I will hit you back
without mercy.

871
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,180
Let's go.

872
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:45,466
I said, let's go.

873
01:42:17,532 --> 01:42:19,955
Rigas. Rigas!

874
01:42:22,246 --> 01:42:25,594
- You?
 -Don't talk. Try to stand on your feet.

875
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:30,552
You did bad in coming.
I didn't ask for anyone's help.

876
01:42:31,632 --> 01:42:34,148
- Leave.
- We are brothers, Rigas.

877
01:42:37,061 --> 01:42:40,262
Brothers? No,

878
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:43,136
there are so many things in between us.

879
01:43:06,717 --> 01:43:09,442
Help!

880
01:43:14,053 --> 01:43:15,386
Help!

881
01:43:19,308 --> 01:43:22,294
What is this, Odysseas Hormovas?
You think you're entering a stable?

882
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:25,464
I'm asking what's going on.

883
01:43:26,819 --> 01:43:28,453
- Don't you know?
- What?

884
01:43:29,824 --> 01:43:31,320
- Eirini...
- What?

885
01:43:32,503 --> 01:43:33,733
- The took her.
- What did you say?

886
01:43:33,853 --> 01:43:35,483
- Two men grabbed her.
- When?

887
01:43:35,603 --> 01:43:39,605
-Just now, we're getting ready to leave.
- Damn you!

888
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,166
Now that you were about to leave?

889
01:43:44,685 --> 01:43:46,770
Is this why you kicked the door?

890
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:52,376
You're the only one I could think of.

891
01:43:53,211 --> 01:43:54,357
You were wrong.

892
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:56,673
If I'm wrong, then I'm glad.

893
01:43:57,978 --> 01:44:00,767
I wouldn't want you to be
the one who dared that.

894
01:44:07,893 --> 01:44:11,151
Wait. With one rifle
and a few shoeless guys

895
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:12,737
you will not achieve much.

896
01:44:14,126 --> 01:44:15,225
I'm coming with you.

897
01:44:20,902 --> 01:44:22,949
Guns and bullets for your people.

898
01:44:23,353 --> 01:44:24,658
I will also give you horses.

899
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:44,464
This morning a woman was kidnapped.
Did you see anything?

900
01:45:47,403 --> 01:45:49,576
Speak! Speak!

901
01:45:49,696 --> 01:45:53,598
At dawn I saw two horses running.

902
01:45:53,718 --> 01:45:55,448
- Did they have a woman with them?
- I couldn't say.

903
01:45:55,568 --> 01:45:57,918
- Why?
- They were running too fast.

904
01:45:58,038 --> 01:46:00,303
- Did you recognize anyone?
- I recognized a horse.

905
01:46:15,603 --> 01:46:16,608
Pasiakos,

906
01:46:17,246 --> 01:46:19,105
this is bad day for you,
do you know that?

907
01:46:19,225 --> 01:46:20,505
What's wrong, what do you want from me?

908
01:46:21,288 --> 01:46:23,669
- Do you know who I am?
- You're Hormovas' son.

909
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:29,930
Watch it punk.

910
01:46:30,662 --> 01:46:33,395
I will ask you only once and
you will give me only one answer.

911
01:46:35,329 --> 01:46:36,991
- Where is the woman?
- What?

912
01:46:38,559 --> 01:46:40,794
- Where is the woman?
- What woman, guys?

913
01:46:41,799 --> 01:46:43,508
Where is she? Where are you hiding her?

914
01:46:45,386 --> 01:46:48,005
Where? Speak, speak!

915
01:46:54,263 --> 01:46:56,131
Tell me where she is, speak!

916
01:47:00,751 --> 01:47:03,674
Odysseas, are you out of your mind?
You want to go to jail?

917
01:47:06,387 --> 01:47:08,613
That bastard has a hut
and a sheepfold up in the mountains.

918
01:47:11,005 --> 01:47:12,019
Everyone, follow me!

919
01:48:47,067 --> 01:48:48,074
What's wrong?

920
01:48:48,136 --> 01:48:50,034
It injured itself somehow
and it limps now.

921
01:48:50,426 --> 01:48:52,126
I'm losing time.
I'll meet you at the ranch.

922
01:49:54,126 --> 01:49:56,191
- What is it, Pasiakos?
- I got scared.

923
01:49:57,525 --> 01:49:59,684
- Everything all right?
- Yes.

924
01:50:32,642 --> 01:50:35,159
That day at the river, you tricked me,

925
01:50:36,163 --> 01:50:37,788
that you might be a man after all.

926
01:50:38,661 --> 01:50:41,769
But you're not a human,
but rather a loathsome animal,

927
01:50:42,416 --> 01:50:45,811
-a wolf that came out of a cursed belly.
- It's your fault,

928
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,895
I asked to make you a noblewoman,

929
01:50:49,468 --> 01:50:52,549
you would walk and everyone
would bow in front of you,

930
01:50:52,906 --> 01:50:54,108
but you said no,

931
01:50:56,373 --> 01:50:57,922
but do you remember what I told you?

932
01:50:58,692 --> 01:50:59,856
When I want something,

933
01:51:00,551 --> 01:51:02,054
I lay my hand and grab it.

934
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:04,993
If only they could cut my hand.

935
01:51:05,922 --> 01:51:08,486
Leave. I love your brother
and he loves me.

936
01:51:08,606 --> 01:51:11,782
- Over time he will get over it.
- Leave me alone, leave!

937
01:51:14,815 --> 01:51:17,209
What will you gain in getting a woman
who doesn't want you?

938
01:51:17,329 --> 01:51:18,375
Leave.

939
01:51:18,495 --> 01:51:19,687
I hate you!

940
01:51:20,354 --> 01:51:22,006
I want you to be my wife.

941
01:51:22,298 --> 01:51:23,913
Tomorrow we will forget everything,

942
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:28,253
and everyone will accept it, everyone.

943
01:52:02,964 --> 01:52:03,978
Father?

944
01:52:09,277 --> 01:52:10,329
Father, no.

945
01:52:12,019 --> 01:52:13,089
No, father!

946
01:52:13,906 --> 01:52:15,052
No, father!

947
01:52:19,692 --> 01:52:22,124
- Father, have you gone mad?
- Don't call me father.

948
01:52:22,594 --> 01:52:25,021
The pig I just saw lying in the dirt
is not my son.

949
01:52:25,228 --> 01:52:26,467
Get lost!

950
01:52:29,021 --> 01:52:31,221
Drop the rifle, old man. Are you crazy?

951
01:52:37,927 --> 01:52:41,702
Drop the rifle I'm telling you, drop it.

952
01:52:46,863 --> 01:52:47,877
Father...

953
01:52:51,117 --> 01:52:53,182
- Father.
- Stay away from me.

954
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:55,464
I've been a land owner,
but I was always a man.

955
01:52:55,971 --> 01:52:59,220
Go away, don't come near me. Go!

956
01:53:01,683 --> 01:53:02,969
I said, leave.

957
01:53:03,889 --> 01:53:04,789
Leave.

958
01:53:21,827 --> 01:53:22,859
Take that road.

959
01:53:45,327 --> 01:53:46,322
Father?

960
01:53:47,468 --> 01:53:49,984
Put a saddle on the horse's back.

961
01:53:51,007 --> 01:53:52,585
I'm beginning a long journey.

962
01:53:54,298 --> 01:53:57,801
Father, who was it? Who was it, father?

963
01:54:04,318 --> 01:54:05,660
- Did you see him?
- Yes.

964
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:07,210
- Who was it?
- Rigas.

965
01:54:09,482 --> 01:54:12,121
He has Eirini with him.
He's heading towards Kolones.

966
01:54:12,241 --> 01:54:14,787
- Odysseas.
- Yes, father.

967
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:20,119
You have a big heart.

968
01:54:20,655 --> 01:54:23,265
- Don't let a woman...
- Father.

969
01:54:24,279 --> 01:54:26,289
You are brothers.
 You share the same blood.

970
01:54:27,087 --> 01:54:29,153
Hold each other's hand tight,

971
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:30,568
next to each other.

972
01:54:30,953 --> 01:54:33,572
- Come on, father.
- Stay there!

973
01:54:39,964 --> 01:54:41,457
All that land,

974
01:54:41,898 --> 01:54:43,983
wide as the open sea, it is yours.

975
01:54:45,025 --> 01:54:47,053
I can hear their voices at Kalifoni.

976
01:54:47,806 --> 01:54:49,384
At Farsala horses are galloping.

977
01:54:50,238 --> 01:54:51,900
At Killeler there's fire!

978
01:54:53,123 --> 01:54:55,076
I can see them coming for your land.

979
01:54:55,499 --> 01:54:58,318
Stay together, fight with all means.

980
01:54:58,929 --> 01:55:00,008
Stop th...

981
01:55:19,918 --> 01:55:21,120
Take him home,

982
01:55:23,067 --> 01:55:24,945
and prepare a great funeral for him.

983
01:55:47,096 --> 01:55:48,768
Aren't we coming with you?

984
01:55:50,129 --> 01:55:52,580
From now on,
I'll do everything on my own.

985
01:57:16,315 --> 01:57:18,458
Go back, Odysseas Hormovas.

986
01:57:18,984 --> 01:57:21,482
It is a sin to spill the blood
of one's brother.

987
01:58:30,953 --> 01:58:32,371
What's going on there?

988
01:58:33,028 --> 01:58:35,479
Rigas killed his father and took Eirini.
- What?

989
01:58:35,854 --> 01:58:37,860
- And who's shooting now?
- His brother, Odysseas.

990
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:42,017
Do you know what? A good day has risen
in the fields, one to remember.

991
01:58:42,354 --> 01:58:43,650
Mount your horses.

992
01:59:01,598 --> 01:59:05,234
Odysseas, for the last time,
I'm telling you to leave. Leave!

993
02:00:58,538 --> 02:01:01,478
- Where is he?
- Giagos, please leave.

994
02:01:05,306 --> 02:01:06,818
Giagos, I'm begging you.

995
02:01:08,498 --> 02:01:09,991
Stay here and keep quiet.

996
02:01:10,698 --> 02:01:12,059
Leave, Giagos!

997
02:01:24,404 --> 02:01:25,925
Did I hurt you much?

998
02:01:29,451 --> 02:01:30,786
Our father?

999
02:01:35,726 --> 02:01:37,416
Take cover, Odysseas Hormovas.

1000
02:01:53,858 --> 02:01:55,304
Odysseas...

1001
02:02:07,566 --> 02:02:09,087
Now, Rigas,

1002
02:02:12,721 --> 02:02:14,658
look down at the land,

1003
02:02:16,413 --> 02:02:17,803
and tell me,

1004
02:02:20,198 --> 02:02:21,859
how much of it is yours?

1005
02:03:08,075 --> 02:03:10,122
The land separated those two,

1006
02:03:11,277 --> 02:03:12,695
and now it brings them together.

1007
02:03:14,407 --> 02:03:17,411
The land which from now on
will belong to everyone the same.

1008
02:03:19,853 --> 02:03:21,712
Let their death unite us.

1009
02:03:22,942 --> 02:03:25,451
And may the years that are to come
find us together,

1010
02:03:26,606 --> 02:03:28,879
to eat some bread that is sweet

1011
02:03:30,637 --> 02:03:31,969
and free.

1012
02:03:40,122 --> 02:03:44,312
A few years later, Thessaly's land
was redistributed to the peasants.

1013
02:03:44,432 --> 02:03:48,256
The war for the liberation of Macedonia
was approaching

1014
02:03:48,376 --> 02:03:52,657
  and Eleftherios Venizelos
was proclaiming:

1015
02:03:54,038 --> 02:04:03,396
<i>"Slaves cannot liberate slaves"
