00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,028
NARRATOR: In 1848,
the United States and Mexico
signed a peace treaty

2
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:39,099
That opened up
the great Southwest
to the wagons of the pioneers.

3
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,901
But when they came
to occupy it,

4
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,736
They found
a lot of other early Americans

5
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,874
Who didn't know or care
about our deal with Mexico.

6
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,943
They had the idea
it was their country.

7
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:53,046
So one day a wagon train
with an Army escort
was attacked.

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,816
(GUNS FIRING)

9
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,286
They buried their dead
where they fell.

10
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,053
OFFICER: Fire!

11
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,127
Then they pushed on
to Fort Gardner,

12
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:11,064
One of the military outposts
that dotted the trail
to California.

13
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,568
But there was
something mysterious
about this attack.

14
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:19,307
Something that set it apart
from all previous raids
on wagon trains.

15
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,509
(ALL CHATTERING)
So Colonel Pollard,
commandant of the post,

16
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,011
Ordered
an immediate investigation.

17
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,515
Your attention, please.

18
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,850
This is Major Davison,
Captain Laurence,

19
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,221
And our confidential
liaison officer,
Mr. James Eagle,

20
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,256
Who, being part
Indian himself,

21
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:38,158
Has been of
great assistance to us
in Indian matters.

22
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,961
Now, the reason
for this inquiry
is simply this,

23
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,597
There is evidence
that a spy was
operating in your camp

24
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,633
The night
of the attack.

25
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,969
Now, Captain Weightman,
have you any suspicion
as to the guilty person?

26
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,939
Nothing on which
I could base
a formal accusation, sir.

27
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,674
Well, I have.

28
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,944
You don't have to search
no further. There's your spy!
That murdering redskin!

29
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,512
Silence, please.

30
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,415
Mr. Simms,
I'll have to ask you
to restrain yourself.

31
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,150
Uh, Crockett,
I understand this Indian

32
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,387
Has acted as
your assistant scout
in other expeditions?

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,957
That's right, sir.
Red Hawk and me,
we sort of grew up together.

34
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,525
He's a Cherokee.

35
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,795
When he was a boy,
his village was wiped out
by Comanches.

36
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:18,232
Some missionaries
brought him up.
I'd stake my life on him.

37
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,234
Well, that... that's
a strong statement.

38
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,602
CROCKETT:
I can back it up, sir.

39
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,770
POLLARD: Go ahead.

40
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:29,310
Well, we hadn't had
a mite of trouble till we hit
the Kiowa Indian country.

41
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,912
We were rolling along
through the San Juan Valley.

42
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:37,050
CROCKETT: I had been scouting
out ahead with Tex McGee,
the civilian wagon boss,

43
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:39,787
And we didn't like
what we ran into.

44
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,555
We rode in to report
to the Captain

45
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,992
That what used to be
a friendly Indian village
had plumb disappeared.

46
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,727
I was just trying
to convince the Captain

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,596
That the time
to worry about Indians

48
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,898
(MAN WHOOPING)
is when they ain't
where they ought to be

49
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:54,935
When Red Hawk rode in
from scouting the hills
on our north flank.

50
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,473
The tribes gather
at council fires.

51
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,510
They talk of war
against all white men.

52
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,278
Any sign
of Sleeping Fox's village?

53
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,179
They are making
a new camp
to the north.

54
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:10,150
Braves paint their faces
for the warpath.

55
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,286
Reckon I better
ride out and have
a powwow with them.

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,787
It's worth trying,
Crockett.

57
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,189
See if you can find out
what's back of all this.

58
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:19,059
The Army will round up
the leaders and hang them.

59
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,595
Looks like it'll take
a heap of rounding up,
Captain.

60
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,798
Come on, Hawk,
let's head for those rocks.

61
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,534
CAPTAIN: Troupe, forward!

62
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,546
CROCKETT: We rode
a good five miles
into the hills

63
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,349
And never saw a feather
or a pony track.

64
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,364
Reckon it's us
that got rounded up.

65
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:06,407
Looks like Sleeping Fox
invited us to a party
whether we like it or not.

66
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,114
Lead the horses back
to those rocks.

67
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:35,369
Why you lead soldiers
and white wagons
into my people's country?

68
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,671
Soldiers go to
Fort Gardner.

69
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,474
White wagons go to

They mean no harm
to your people,

71

at council fire
under new chief.

72

The word has passed.
It is war.

73
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,721
Go, tell your people
to turn back
before it's too late.

74
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,924
Sorry, Chief,
our orders are to go ahead.

75
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,226
Then you will not
go back.

76

CROCKETT: I didn't know
whether he was bluffing
or not,

77

to wait long
to find out.

one charge, Sleeping Fox
wasted no more men on us.

He figured he had us
sewed up anyway.

83

By dark, Sleeping Fox
had half the braves
of his tribe with him.

And I knew
if we didn't get out
before sun-up,

85
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,389
We wouldn't get out at all.

gave us just the one chance
we needed.

We drew straws to see
which one of us was to
lead the Indians a-chase,

95

And Red Hawk won.

169
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,777
Hey now, you... you ain't gone
and fell without even
firing a shot, have you?

170
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,815
You're aiming
to get yourself hog-tied.

171
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,684
Maybe, but
I aim to get me
some education.

172
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:10,657
Well, sir, I reckon
that's about all
till the night of the attack.

173
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,327
Colonel, can't we
get down to business?

174
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,364
My wife's out there
bad hurt,

175
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,632
And there's
the sneaking devil
that brought it on her.

176
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,236
Mr. Simms, we all understand
and sympathize with you,

177
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,438
But this is
an investigation,
not a trial.

178
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,841
Why don't you ask him
what he was doing
up in the hills

179
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,211
With his Injun friends
for two days.

180
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,480
They didn't jump us
until the night he came back.

181
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,182
Red Hawk,
is that true?

182
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,816
Yes, sir.

183
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,587
I tried to learn who is
the leader uniting the tribes
in war upon the whites.

184
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,122
But with no success?

185
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,558
No, sir,
but there is such a man.
I heard them speak of him.

186
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,094
When was this?

187
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,295
HAWK:
The night of the attack.

188
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,930
Go on, tell us about it.

189
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:54,334
I had picked up
the blood trail of one of
Sleeping Fox's Indian braves.

190
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,037
HAWK: It led me
to a meeting place
in the mountains.

(MAN SPEAKING

192
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:07,614
They spoke of many guns
and much ammunition
the new Chief had given them.

193
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,617
They were planning
to attack the wagon train.

194
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,223
Camp was made
that night near Red Butte.

195
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,459
They had no idea that
danger was so near at hand.

196

(SINGING

00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,800
Kind of
a happy camp, tonight.

00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,570
Isn't it?

199
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:34,241
Yeah, I wonder why
it can't always be
peaceful like this.

200
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,911
There's a powerful lot
of land in this country.

201
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:41,982
Enough for everybody.
Indians and whites alike.

202
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,583
If they'd only
portion it out.

203
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,286
That's been tried,
by treaties.

204
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,556
The settlers
always move into
the Indian's lands.

205
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,094
Yeah, I aim to do something
about that some day.

206
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:58,665
I'd like to go to Washington
like my uncle did,
the famous Davy Crockett.

207
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,936
Oh, Hawk.

208
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,073
This is Red Hawk,
my assistant scout.

209
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,608
He does all
the hard work
for me.

210
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,510
Miss Oatman joined
our outfit
the night we had

211
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,280
Our little ruckus
with Sleeping Fox.

212
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,149
Excuse us, ma'am.

213
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,784
Red Hawk's been out
in the hills
for two days,

214
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,820
And I reckon
I'd better get him
some grub.

215
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,228
What did you
find out, Hawk?

216
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,098
War party, Kiowas.
Many braves.

217
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,665
How far away?

218
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,436
In hills just beyond camp.
They come to attack tonight.

219
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,771
Are you sure?

220
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,540
I heard them talk.

221
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,611
We'd better go
tell the Captain.

222
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,082
HAWK: The Captain ordered
the camp on the alert

223
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,651
And doubled the guard
on the horses.

224
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,123
The plan was to
make the Kiowas think

225
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:59,259
The camp was asleep
and unprepared,

226
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,029
But every man
was ready and waiting.

227
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,930
It was ordered that
no one should shoot

228
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,067
Until the Captain himself
fired the signal gun.

229
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,076
What makes you
so sure they'll attack
from this side?

230
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,978
My guess is they'll try
to run off the horses.

231
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,381
Cavalry and wagons
ain't much good
without horses.

It don't do no good,

right in the ground.

Come on.

247
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,725

whether it was a man,

Of wrapping a horse hair
around the buckle
when I put my papers away.

the horse hair's gone, and
the papers are disarranged.

close the case?

This evening
when I left the tent
to go to supper.

255
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,215
Well, whoever it was
must have come in
under the back wall

256
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,883
During the attack.

if we can find any tracks.

HAWK: Crockett and I
found footprints
leading out from camp.

259
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,629

during the fight.

about all you have
to tell us, Red Hawk?

00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,738

No, sir.

263

is this court going to
take an Injun's word?

264
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,709
I'll take his word.

265
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,045
Well, I saw him
at the Captain's tent.

266
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,281
Those moccasin prints,
doesn't that pin it on him?

267
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,317
No more than it pins it
on a lot of other people who
wear moccasins around camp.

268

the accusations.

what you were doing
through the attack.

from the rest of the hearing.

Well, gentlemen,

279
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,321
We've examined
all the witnesses
and got nowhere.

A dispatch
from Great Plains, sir.

281
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,807
That's all.

282
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,817
Well, there can
no longer be any doubt
that there was a spy

283
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,352
And that he made
good use
of the information

284
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,587
He got from
your dispatches, Weightman.

285
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:58,024
The Indians
of the Great Plains area
are on the move.

286
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,226
Colonel, did you
ever hear of Indians
messing around

287
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,561
With military dispatches?

288
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,296
Never.

289
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,133
No, it looks almost like
some white man's brain's
back of all this.

290
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,935
What's your opinion,
Mr. Eagle?

Men of many tribes
bring their furs
to my trading post.

292
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:17,209
I have heard some talk
of local unrest,
but nothing more.

293
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,578
You don't seem
to take much stock

294
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,781
In this new chief
uniting the tribes
in a general uprising, eh?

295
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,416
Frankly, no.

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,256
Now, you've been
through this country before,

298
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,926
I must send fresh supplies
and ammunition
to Great Plains.

299
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,997
Can heavily loaded wagons
get through Manitou Pass?

300
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,266
Yeah, you can make it
all right, Colonel.

301
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,936
The long way around,
through South Pass,
is easier going.

302
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,645
There ain't no call for you
to feel low-down, Hawk.

303
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,316
Nobody suspects you
except that tenderfoot Simms.
He's just Injun-jumpy.

304
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,654
I'd like to clear away
even his suspicions.

305
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,056
Got any ideas
how to do it?

306
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,191
No.

307
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,227
Have you?

308
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,832
Who me? All I know about
is horses and wagons.

309
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,304
You take the schoolmarm's
team there, for instance.

310
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,140
What about them?

311
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:26,112
Oh, nothing, except when
she come rearing into camp
that night

sure galloping mighty fresh

For a team what drug a wagon
all the way from St. Louis.

314
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,389
She may have changed
horses somewhere.

315
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:40,326

Oh!

318
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,854
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to frighten you.

319
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:45,925
I'm not easily frightened,
but you popped out
so suddenly.

320
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,361
I was just thinking of you
and there you were.

321
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,098
I've been wanting to tell you
since the hearing,
that I, for one,

322
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,366
Never had any doubts
about you.

323
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,936
That is good to hear.

324
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,972
It would be better still
if I had no doubts about you.

325
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:03,042
(LAUGHING)
Oh, that sounds
so mysterious.

326
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,077
What is your tribe?

327
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,517
My tribe?

328
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,386
It is difficult for one
of Indian blood to hide it
from another Indian.

329
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,889
I felt it
the first time I saw you.

330
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,567
My father is
half Dakota.

331
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,302
My mother was white.

332
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,304
And the name, "Oatman"?

333
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,643
It was my mother's
family name.

334
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:41,413
I've used it since
I was sent to white schools,
since I was a little girl.

335
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,086
Why are you ashamed
of your Indian blood?

336
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,522
I'm not, I'm proud of it.

337
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:53,860
But why boast about it
among people who are
prejudiced and suspicious?

338
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,364
If that is your only secret,

339
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,900
It will be safe with me.

340
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,335
Well,
what else could there be?

341
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,538
When the hungry fox hunts,

342
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,440
He overlooks no tracks.

343
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,253
Where you been?
Chief been waiting for you.

344
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,521
I...

345
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,007
TEX: I'll take care of him
for you, Davy.

346
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,848
Is something
troubling you, Davy?

347
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:53,019
What would you say, Hawk,
if I told you I don't think
that driver of Miss Oatman's

348
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,354
Is deaf or dumb?

349
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,691
I would say what troubles
you most is the question,

350
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,392
Does the girl know it?

351
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,129
I ain't made any secrets
as to how I feel about her.

352
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,565
Why do you think
the man is false?

353
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,302
Because I saw
an Indian stableman at Eagle's
corral talking to him.

354
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,371
Did this man, Ben,
also talk?

355
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,773
No.

356
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,109
No, he just made signs
and noises like
he does around camp.

357
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:20,613
But it looked like
he could hear, and
if he can hear, he can talk.

358
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,548
An Army doctor
told me that.

359
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,451
It should be easy enough
to trap this man.

360
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,822
Yeah.

361
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,859
Yeah, wait here.

362
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:43,736
Hello, Miss Frances.
Hello, Davy.

363
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,938
Meet my twin sister, Maggie.

364
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:48,007
She don't favor
you much.

365
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,076
Well, we're
the same size.

366
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:57,549
Funny, I can't get used
to that driver of yours
being deaf and dumb.

367
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,119
How'd you ever happen
to hire him, anyhow?

368
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,388
Well, for one thing,
I knew I'd be pretty safe

369
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,191
Coming across Indian
country with him.

370
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,326
Yeah, how does
that figure?

371
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,528
Why, didn't you know
that Indians never
harm anyone

372
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,931
Mentally
or physically afflicted?

373
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,534
What do you know,
I forgot all about that.

374
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,969
But it's true.

375
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,371
Old Jim Bridger got away
from a whole mess
of Blackfoot Indians

376
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,307
By pretending
he'd gone crazy.

377
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,642
FRANCES:
Of course, that war party
that chased us into your camp

378
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:26,112
Didn't give me a chance
to explain about Ben.

379
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,547
Yeah, I reckon Ben takes
a lot of explaining.

380
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,149
(GUN FIRING)

381
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,453
(LAUGHS)
Doggone my hide, I...

382
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,024
I'd forgotten all about
this spare gun of mine
having a hair-trigger.

383
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,826
I hope I didn't scare
you none, ma'am.

384
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,762
(LAUGHING) Not as much
as it did you.

385
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,264
I'd better
have this thing fixed,
before I shoot somebody.

386
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,933
Accidental-like.

387
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:59,311
Well, Hawk, I'm sure glad
to get that off my mind.

388
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,081
It is good to see
my friend happy again.

389
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:03,182
Afternoon, Captain.

390
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,683
Afternoon, Crockett.

391
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:07,686
The Colonel and I
have decided to hold back
our choice of routes

392
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,956
Until we come
to the fork in the trail.

393
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,724
That's a good idea.

394
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,259
And if anyone should
want to know before then?

395
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,796
Report it to me at once.
That in itself
would be suspicious.

396
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,131
Yes, sir.
Be ready to roll
at sunrise.

397
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,933
I'll be ready, sir.

398
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,170
Tex?
TEX: Oh!

399
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,305
Better ride
into town and
round up your pilgrims,

400
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,473
We roll at sun-up.

401
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,382
Column, right!

402
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,058
Stay back here,
and keep moving, Tex.

403
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,760
I'll ride forward
with the Captain.

404
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,461
All right, Davy.

405
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:10,783
Their last water camp
will be at Indian Springs.

406
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:14,153
Then they'll have
to decide what route
they're going to take.

407
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,755
We'll be at camp
close by.

408
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,559
Get our horses
and pack ponies ready,
we're leaving tonight.

409
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,386
Reckon you'll have
this dress ready
for the Virginia Reel

410
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,989
With your prize scholar
when we get to Great Plains?

411
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,291
That depends on
how long it takes.

412
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,625
I can't sew
while we're rolling

413
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:57,529
And I'll need at least
three evenings to finish it.

414
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:02,001
Ah, you're sure going to cut
a dash among the gold braid
boys in that outfit.

415
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,669
Reckon I won't even
have a look in.

416
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,438
Now, there's no use
fishing like that.

417
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,974
I won't promise you a dance

418
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,910
Until you finish
that English composition
I told you to write.

419
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,879
Oh, she's did.

420
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,381
(LAUGHING)
Davy, "She's did."

421
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,218
Well, she's done.
It's done.

422
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:22,254
This composition
isn't feminine.

423
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,823
Well, she's sure
all about a female.

424
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,970
So I see.

425
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,574
It's a beautiful
composition, Davy.

426
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,377
Your teacher is
proud of you.

427
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,646
Well, I know it ain't
spelled very good,

428
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,918
I always get into trouble
with them little
tadpole letters, "g" and "p."

429
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:55,587
Can't remember which side
their head's turned on.

430
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:59,658
Maybe my head's turned
the wrong way, too.

431
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,896
Give me a chance
to study this, and I'll
correct it as soon as I can.

432
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,899
Well, I ought to get
A for effort anyhow.

433
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,268
All of that,

434
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,671
And that dance
at Great Plains, too.

435
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,843
Well, that makes me
as happy as a horned toad
on a hot rock.

436
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,545
Thank you, ma'am.

437
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,647
Thank you.

438
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,151
Teacher kept you
after school, didn't she?

439
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,121
Tex, do you reckon
I can get me some store-bought
clothes in Great Plains?

440
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,656
Store-bought clothes?

441
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,659
Mr. Crockett,
the Captain
wants to see you.

442
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:38,030
Maybe he'll lend you
a stovepipe hat,
you gall-darned dude.

443
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,832
Store-bought clothes!

444
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:45,237
Crockett,
from our camp here,
at Indian Springs,

445
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:48,840
How long will it take us
to reach the mouth
of Manitou Pass?

446
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:52,444
Well, we ought to
be there
by noon tomorrow.

447
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,347
Looks like
a perfect place
for an ambush.

448
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:56,815
Yeah.

449
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,585
Yeah, the devil himself
couldn't have built
a better one.

450
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:03,555
Captain,
let's play it safe
and go through South Pass.

451
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,225
If they attack there
we'll stand a good chance
to beat them off.

452
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,061
Very well, Crockett.
South Pass it is.

453
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,197
The only thing is, sir,
we'll have to let
the camp know tonight,

454
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,764
So we can take on water.

455
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,234
South Pass is bone-dry.

456
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,470
That means
we'll be letting
the spy know as well.

457
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:20,306
Hawk and I'll keep
a close watch.

458
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,974
You know,
this may smoke him out.

459
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,209
Right.

460
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,411
If we don't learn
who it is before
we get to Great Plains,

461
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,679
We'll never know.

462
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,880
Go to it.

463
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,216
Yes, sir.

464
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,086
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

465
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,330
We're going by way
of South Pass, folks.

466
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,639
Hello, Davy,
you and the Captain
playing checkers again?

467
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,207
Ah, sort of.

468
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:56,742
Figuring out which pass
we'll head for

469
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,944
When we hit the fork
in the trail tomorrow.

470
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,879
Oh? You didn't decide,
I suppose.

471
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,848
CROCKETT:
Yeah, we sure did.

472
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,417
Looks like you'll get
that dress finished
in time for our dance.

473
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:07,553
We're going the long way,
through South Pass.

474
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:11,057
Say, what's the idea
of dragging this thing
out three extra days?

475
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,491
Two things, Simms.

476
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,994
South Pass
is an easy wagon trail
and open country.

477
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,996
No place for an ambush.

478
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:20,366
Tex.

479
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,101
Mmm?

480
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:26,205
Spread word around camp
to fill all the water barrels
before we roll in the morning.

481
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,308
There'll be three
dry camps in a row.

482
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,620
No sleep for you and me
tonight, Hawk.

483
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,391
Do you think the spy might
try to pass that news on
to the Kiowa?

484
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,793
It wouldn't surprise me
a bit if the big wolf
of the Kiowas

485
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,862
Was out there
in the hills now
waiting for it.

486
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:54,566
In the dark,
wolf and coyote
look alike.

487
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,769
Yeah, but tonight,
we're weasel-trapping.

488
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:03,242
You watch this half
of the circle,
I'll take the other.

489
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,611
And if someone
should leave camp?

490
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:08,480
Follow and
bring them back.

491
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,151
(WHISPERING)
I'll slip out
and join High Tree.

492
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:15,987
If Crockett trails me,
we'll lead him
far off the track.

493
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:19,158
When things are quiet,
I'll get away myself.

494
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,860
One of us
has to get word
to my father.

495
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,573
Welcome to my fire.

496
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:41,380
I was watching you
and Davy Crockett.

497
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,682
You didn't tell him
about me, did you?

498
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:48,387
No, but you are wrong
in thinking it would
turn his heart against you.

499
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,790
Oh, if I thought that,
there would be no problem.

500
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:56,328
I like him very much,
but I'm not in love with him.

501
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:02,201
Isn't it too soon to know
where your heart
will lead you?

502

It doesn't take long
for a girl to know that.

503
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,844
In its hurry
to reach the shining river,

504
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:15,147
The mountain brook
makes many mistakes.

505
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:18,384
But all the time
it knows where it's going,

506
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:22,321
And nothing can keep
the brook and the river
apart for long.

507
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,355
Good night.

508
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,094
Good night.

509
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,271
We only got his horse.

510
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:22,073

at the head of the canyon.

This is the same gun
you couldn't hear
at Gardner the other day,

513
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:20,532
And it's still got
a hair-trigger.

That don't work anymore,
you good-for-nothing

I threw. Come on,

play Indian, do you?

Come on, weasel.

00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,481
Well, I can't knock
a runt like you around,

519
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,449
But I can
sure play Indian
with you.

520

Come on, now.

521
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:46,124
This is a favorite game
of those Kiowas
you've been helping out.

522

When I cut the next one,
I don't know
whether she'll hold or not.

523
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,635
So you better start talking.

to lead Davy Crockett

You have
done your work well.

Tomorrow you will
ride with us
as an Indian princess.

Now go and get some rest.

544

The white men have chosen
to face battle with us
at South Pass.

545
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:57,589
That means
we will need the warriors
from all the villages.

546
00:40:57,623 --> 00:41:01,727
The fort at Great Plains
will first be surrounded
and cut off.

547
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,361
Then at South Pass,

548
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,965
We must have enough warriors
to attack from three sides.

fighting on the side

I could make
good use of you.

552
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:36,227
You'll need all your breath
to tell these Kiowas
what a great man you are.

553
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,798
You'll die
in tomorrow's sun.

Who would bring destruction
upon these tribes,

Through his own desire
for power and glory.

My father fights only
for the good of all Indians.

Even when he called you
a princess, he was
thinking only of himself.

A new Indian emperor,
a second Pontiac.

567
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,570

own people were massacred

Sergeant, take her horse.

WEIGHTMAN: It isn't likely
that you came here

671
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,980
Just to submit to arrest,
Miss Eagle.

672
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,082
I've come to bring you
important information.

673
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,318
Very well.
Dismount, please.

entering my tent

my dispatch case?

Yes, and last night
I took more information
to my father.

you realize that
I have full authority

as an enemy spy?

on what I say,
I'll die anyway

we could
believe you.

for the day when I could
help the Indian cause.

686
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:09,093
Until I learned he wasn't
just waging a war,
but planning a massacre.

687
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,996
You say he means
to attack Great Plains
at dawn tomorrow?

688
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,765
Yes, and also they'll be
waiting at South Pass

689
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:19,103
To attack you in full force
and destroy the wagon train.

690
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,106
How can we believe
a word she says, Captain?

691
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,108
I agree with you,
Simms.

692
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,144

in a proven spy.

from Great Plains, sir.

did you come,

Any sign of
hostiles there?

698
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:46,631
Not in the pass.
They've got the fort
cut off.

699

are heading for South Pass.

What the Sergeant says,
and this dispatch,

701

the girl's story.

00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,644
Yes, sir, Captain,
it sure does.

TEX: Yeah.

704
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,480
Take the Sergeant along,
and get him a fresh horse.

705
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,848
Sure, Cap.

706
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,785
Uh, Crockett.

We've got to get
to Great Plains today.

if they don't get supplies
and ammunition

709

Before the attack
in the morning.

710
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:23,468
Well, we'll have to
switch our plans and go by
the way of Manitou Pass, sir.

711
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,303
Well,
we've got to chance it.

712
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:27,638
I'll send word to McHale
we're coming through Manitou

713
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:30,308
And that we should
reach him tonight.

Right, sir.
Right.

715

you've told us the truth.

that I must hold you
under arrest

by higher authority.

for her, sir.

00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,028
There may be an ambush.

ride in a ways
and see what's what?

to scout to the rear, Tex.

a double blow.

Well, are you suggesting
that we let these prisoners
go free?

838
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:48,184
Oh, no, sir.
I'd hold them prisoner.

839
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,688
They ought to pay
for what they did.

840
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,657
(CLEARING THROAT)
Well, uh,

841
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:56,793
What are your recommendations
as to sentence?

842
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:59,663
I'd... I'd hold 'em

843
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:06,436
Until we can
scare up a preacher
to make them man and wife.

844
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:08,705
And furthermore,
under military auspices,

845
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:11,508
You will start
the first Indian school
in this district,

846
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,377
With the hope that you both
may help to bring about

847
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,313
A better understanding
between the Indians
and the whites.

848
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:18,315
Oh, thank you, sir.

849
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:22,886
Thank you, Davy.

850
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,388
Good luck.
