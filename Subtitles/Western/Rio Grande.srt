Neither do I,
but that's the policy...

55
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,724
and soldiers don't make policy.
They merely carry it out.

could do something.

May I also
put something straight?

181
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,919
Proceed.

182
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:19,429
I'm not in this post
to call you father.

183
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,023
I was ordered here
as Trooper Jefferson Yorke...

184
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,035
of the United States Cavalry.

185
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,798
That's all I wish to be, sir.

Then we understand each other.

187
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,806

188
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,173
KIRBY: Sergeant Major?

189
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,769
The recruits are for field duty

190
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,438
Dismissed.

191
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:37,909
QUINCANNON: Trooper Yorke.

KIRBY:
What are you waiting for?

193
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,256
Trooper Yorke expects his salute
to be returned.

194
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,916

Can't you go around faster?

198
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,192
Keep your heads down!
That's it!

199
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,257
Hey, hey!

200
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,097
Keep it coming now!

201

You got it made!

202
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,397
There we go!

203
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,937
Once again and faster!

204
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,168
SERGEANT:
Put it up another notch.

205
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:39,767
Give 'em a good jump.

206
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,645
See how easy it is?

207
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,911
When I was a young man
like yourselves...

208
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:48,782
I could jump nine feet tall...

209
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,378
with an Indian under each arm.

210
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,685
What tribe?

211
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,721
QUINCANNON:
Once again and faster!

212
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,322

TROOPER: Yaah!

214
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,068
TYREE: Appears to me
they make a lot of fuss...

215
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:12,405
jumping a horse
over some sticks.

216
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,705
BOONE: Yo.

217
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,804

That's a six-foot jump, Travis.

218
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,179
QUINCANNON:
Give them their heads.

219
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,684
Now over!

220
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:21,912
There, you see?

221
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,955
That gives you an idea
what horsemanship is like...

222
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:25,216
in the United States Cavalry.

223
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,953
Now after that
comes the Roman teams.

224
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,392
That's easy.

225
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,396
It's the way the Romans
used to ride.

226
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,931
The ancient Romans.

227
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,660

228
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,792

TYREE: Mister, what time do you
blow the horn around here...

233
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,085
for folks to eat?

234
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,277
QUINCANNON: Do you think you'd
like to try that before you eat?

235
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,873
TYREE: You mean ride
like them ancient Romans?

236
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:23,937
QUINCANNON: Yes.

BOONE:
That the general idea, doc?

249
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,255
QUINCANNON:
That's the general idea...

250
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,120
but before I'm through
with youse...

251
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:42,352
you'll be taking them jumps
backwards.

252
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,190
Is there another man...

253
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:50,033
PRESCOTT: The marshal
wants to make a routine check.

254
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:53,093
He thinks perhaps this man
might be among our new recruits.

255
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:03,037

Tyree among your horse thieves?

That name's kind of familiar,
ain't it, Mink?

267
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,915
Name's Tyree.

268

Oh. The reluctant arsonist.

393

KATHLEEN: The safest way for
us to start our conversation...

394
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,627
would be for you to just say...

395
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,926
"To what do I owe the honor
of your visit?"

396

for your visit this morning.

KATHLEEN: How is he?

398
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:00,660
KIRBY: He's grown considerably,
I thought.

399
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,798
Right now he's bruised up
a little.

400
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,238
Had a fight. Not much.

401
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:06,103
KATHLEEN: A fight?

402
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,701
With another soldier.

403
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,406

Hardly with an officer?

405
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,681
He's not gentleman enough
for that.

KIRBY: You said it... soldier.
That's enough for me.

407
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:19,119
Not for me.

408
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,991
Jeff was boyishly ashamed when
he was expelled from West Point.

409
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,689
He shouldn't have enlisted.

410
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:27,697
I could have sent him
to Lexington.

411
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,392
He could have tutored
in mathematics...

412
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,401
and then got his commission.

413
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,666
But he did enlist,
and he's here.

414
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:38,767

He signed enlistment papers.
He took an oath.

you're a fine figure of a woman.

in that chest.

You don't have to hide
your bruises, Jeff.

533
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:38,866
Your father
told me all about them.

534
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,824
What kind of man is he, mother?

535
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,792
He's a lonely man.

536
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:13,367
He's a very lonely man.

537
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,232
They say he's a great soldier.

538
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:20,740
I suppose he is, but...

539
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:26,241
what makes soldiers great
is hateful to me.

540
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:33,982
I've come
to take you home, Jeff.

541
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,889
I can't leave, mother.

542
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,326
It'd be quitting.

543
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:47,667
You're stubborn and proud,
Jeff...

544
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,932

I'm gonna work this out
my own way.

550
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,221
I'll take you home...

551
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:19,996
as soon as your father signs
your papers.

552
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,063
Maybe they didn't tell you,
mother...

553
00:42:25,308 --> 00:42:28,869
but the application requires
my signature, too.

554
