OUT OF THE FATHER AND BROTHERS  
HE'S THE SECOND TOUGHEST        

111
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,512
THEY ALL ACT                    

112
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,114
LIKE THEY OWN                   
THE PLACE.                      

113
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:31,915
    THE WAY THINGS              
ARE NOW, THEY DO.               

114
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,684
IT WILL STAY                    
    THAT WAY                    

115
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,253
TILL WE FIND                    
    A SHERIFF                   

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,721
    THAT ISN'T                  
    AFRAID.

00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:16,427
        [Gunshots]

        [Woman screams]         

120
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:12,133
        ALL RIGHT,              
        YOU ALL SAW IT,         

121
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:16,137
            AND IT WAS          
        A FAIR FIGHT.           

122
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,974
        HE DREW FIRST.          
    IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.        

123
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,443
HE DREW FIRST.                  
SURE AS ANYTHING.               

124
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:25,413
            IT WASN'T ANYTHING  
            BUT SELF-DEFENSE.   

125
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,749
            IT WAS SOMETHING,   
        BUT NOT SELF-DEFENSE.   

126
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,784
        HE DIDN'T DRAW FIRST.   

127
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:36,991
                YOU DID.        

128
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:38,559
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?               

129
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,261
            IT'S AN OLD TRICK.  

130
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,829
                    YOU DID IT  
                    PRETTY WELL.

131
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:44,132
                NOT REAL WELL,  
                BUT PRETTY WELL.

132
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,933
            YOU FEINTED WITH    
            YOUR LEFT SHOULDER, 

133
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,901
            GETTING HIM TO GO   
            FOR HIS GUN.        

134
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:50,138
    WHILE YOU WERE GOING        
    FOR YOURS AT THE SAME TIME. 

135
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,606
            IT'S AN ARIZONA     
                TRICK,          

136
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:55,476

                WORD I SAID,    

139
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:00,748
                    AND I DIDN'T
                CALL YOU A LIAR.

140
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,584
    I SAID, YOU FEINTED WITH    
            YOUR LEFT SHOULDER  

141
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:05,052
        WHILE GOING FOR YOUR GUN
        WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND.   

142
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,521
            SO?

        TO THE DRAW.            

144

            HE'S DEAD           
        AND YOU'RE ALIVE.       

145
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,560
        THAT'S THE IDEA OF      
        THE GAME, ISN'T IT?     

146
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,061

00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:34,625

            THE MINE OWNERS.    

219
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,026
        NICE TO MEET YOU.       

220
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,996
        WHAT THAT FELLOW        
        SAID AIN'T TRUE.        

221
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,431
            WE'VE HAD           
        THREE SHERIFFS.         

222
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,067
        BUT ONLY TWO OF         
        THEM GOT KILLED.        

223
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:44,635
WHAT ABOUT                      
THE OTHER ONE?                  

224
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,236
            HE QUIT KIND        
            OF SUDDEN-LIKE.     

225
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:49,807
        HE DIDN'T HAVE THE      
        RIGHT TEMPERAMENT.      

226
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:52,242
    WHAT ABOUT                  
        THE PAY?                

227
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,847

        MAN, $150 A MONTH.      

228

    WITH THE SPIRALING          
    PRICES AROUND HERE,         

229
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,452
    THAT WILL LAST              
    ABOUT EIGHT DAYS.           

230
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,221
        THAT INCLUDES           
        ROOM AND BOARD.         

231
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:07,157
        NOT AT EMMA'S           
        FOOD EMPORIUM?

00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:10,293
            AT MY HOUSE.        
        MY DAUGHTER COOKS.      

233
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:12,195
    I THINK IT'S ONLY           
    FAIR TO TELL YOU,           

234
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:13,363
        I'M ONLY                
INTERESTED IN THIS JOB          

235
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:14,598
    ON A TEMPORARY BASIS.       

236
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,500
    OH?                         

237
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,368
    I WAS ON MY WAY             
    TO AUSTRALIA                

238
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:20,270
    WHEN I HEARD ABOUT          
    YOUR GOLD STRIKE.           

239
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:23,841
    AND I DECIDED TO            
TRAVEL THROUGH HERE.            

240
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,609
                    WHAT'S IN   
                    AUSTRALIA?  

241
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,345
        IT'S THE LAST           
    FRONTIER COUNTRY.           

242
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:31,048
        I MIGHT DO              
    SOME PIONEERING.            

243
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,283
    I THOUGHT THIS              
    WAS FRONTIER COUNTRY        
    AND WE WAS PIONEERS.        

244
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,019
ME, TOO.                        

245
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,187
        IF I TAKE               
    THE SHERIFF'S JOB,          

246
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,356
IT'D HAVE TO BE WITH            
    THE UNDERSTANDING           

247
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,125
        THAT I GET              
        ENOUGH TIME OFF         

248
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,793
TO DO PROSPECTING               
I CAME HERE TO DO IN            
THE FIRST PLACE.                

249
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,327
                    WELL, YEAH. 

250
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:47,164
                WHAT ABOUT YOUR 
            JOB QUALIFICATIONS? 

251
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:48,966

        ABOUT THAT.             

252
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,701
        IF I TAKE IT,           
YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU GOT ME.      

253
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,770
                        IT'S A  
                    QUESTION    

254
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:56,439
                OF YOU BEING    
            ABLE TO HANDLE IT.  

255
00:17:56,507 --> 00:18:00,044
OLLY, WE                        
CAN'T BE CHOOSEY.               

256
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:01,344
HIM                             
TALKING ABOUT IT                

257
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:02,980

RIGHT ATTITUDE.                 

258
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,482
                I DON'T CARE!   
                I'M THE MAYOR!  

259
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,551
    IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY      
            TO HIRE A SHERIFF   

260
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:09,419
        THAT'S NOT ONLY GOT     
            QUALIFICATIONS,     

261
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:12,856
        BUT THAT AIN'T GOING    
        TO GET HISSELF KILLED.  

262
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,958
                OLLY, HAVEN'T   
                WE ALREADY--    

263
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,577
THERE YOU ARE.                  

264
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,145
                        WHAT'S  
                    YOUR POINT? 

265
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:38,248
AN EXHIBITION                   
OF MARKSMANSHIP.                

266
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,084
THE BULLET WENT                 
THROUGH THE HOLE.               

267
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:42,485
                        WELL,   
                MAYBE IT DID.   

268
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:44,021
    IT DID. YOU CAN             
    TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.        

269
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,022
    I'D LIKE TO                 
TAKE YOUR WORD--                

270
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,350
    WOULD YOU                   
    DO IT AGAIN?                

271
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,684
AGAIN?                          

272
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,386
                        IF YOU  
                    DON'T MIND. 

273
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:01,188
I SHOT                          
YOUR ROOF.                      

274
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:01,788
                        THAT'S  
                    ALL RIGHT.  

275
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:18,071
            I HOPE YOU          
        DIDN'T TAKE             
            NO OFFENSE          

276
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,106
                        AT WHAT 
                I SAID BEFORE.  

277
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:23,110
NO.                             

278
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:27,247
    JUST TO KEEP                
    THE RECORD STRAIGHT,        
    $150 A MONTH IS FINE,       

279
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:28,915
BUT I'VE GOT                    
TO DO PROSPECTING.              

280
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,817
I'M GOING                       
TO AUSTRALIA--                  

281
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,520
YOU JUST                        
NAME YOUR TERMS.                

282
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:36,723
WE'LL RUSH                      
TO MEET THEM.                   

283
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,925
        AS LONG AS              
EVERYTHING'S STRAIGHT.          

284
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:41,561
        IS THERE                
    SOME KIND OF BADGE?         

285
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:48,135
    YOU BET                     
    THERE IS!                   

286
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,187
                    I'M AFRAID  
                IT'S BENT UP.   

287
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,006
IT MUST HAVE SAVED              
SOMEONE'S LIFE.                 

288
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:55,075
                IT WOULD HAVE   
                IF IT WEREN'T   

289
00:19:55,143 --> 00:20:01,114
                    FOR THEM    
                OTHER BULLETS.  

290
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:04,351
GENTLEMEN,                      
DO WE HAVE                      
A JAIL HERE?                    

291
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:05,252
DO WE HAVE                      
A JAIL?                         

292
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,220
    A BRAND-NEW ONE             

293
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,589
    THAT THE WHOLE              
    COMMUNITY BUILT             
        LAST MONTH.             

294
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:11,258
JUST LIKE A                     
BARN RAISING.                   

295
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:13,360
    EVEN THE                    
    DANCE HALL                  
    GIRLS HELPED.               

296
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:14,928
CARRIED ON                      
LIKE CRAZY.                     

297
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:17,897
            IT WAS DESIGNED     
        TO BE ESCAPE-PROOF.     

298
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:20,867
            I THINK I NEED TO   
                THROW A COUPLE  
                OF PEOPLE IN IT.

299
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,335
        THERE'S ONLY            
        ONE THING.              

300
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:23,603
        THIS JAIL HAS           
            EVERYTHING.         

301
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:26,573
EVEN                            
A STOVE.                        

302
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,243
            ONLY IT HASN'T      
            GOT IRON BARS.      

303
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,345
        YOU'RE KIDDING.         

304
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,348
        WE SENT AWAY FOR THEM,  
    BUT THEY AIN'T ARROVE YET.  

305
00:20:34,415 --> 00:20:36,049
        IT'S GOT                
    EVERYTHING ELSE--           

306
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:37,851
        WINDOWS, BROOMS,        
        KEROSENE LAMPS...       

307
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,586
        YOU NAME IT.            

308
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:40,920
        JUST NO BARS            
        FOR THE CELLS.          

309
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:43,857
            RIGHT.              

310
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:46,276
    I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.    

311
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:49,646
                ARE YOU WANTED  
                FOR ANYTHING?   

312
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:50,981
                    NOT THAT    
                    IT MATTERS  

313
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:52,416
                        BECAUSE 
                WE UNDERSTAND   

314
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,351
                HOW THEM LITTLE 
            THINGS CAN HAPPEN.  

315
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:03,326
    NO, I'M NOT WANTED          
    FOR ANYTHING ANYWHERE.      

316
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,830
    DO YOU REALIZE              
    THE CHANCE YOU              
    WAS TAKING?                 

317
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,632
HE MIGHT HAVE                   
TOOK OFFENSE.                   

318
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,467
                I'M THE MAYOR!  

319
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,769
                        I GOT   
            RESPONSIBILITIES!   

320
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:12,569
                        IT HAD  
                TO BE ASKED!    

321
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,538
    IF I                        
    COULD GET                   

322
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,273
    SOME MEN                    
    ON THIS PUMP,               

323
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:34,974
    WE COULD                    
    STOP THIS.                  

324
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,510
            SURE THING,         
            SHERIFF.            

325
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:37,043
            GIVE US A HAND,     
            WILL YOU, MEN?      

326
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,221
        ALL RIGHT, MEN!         

327

        LET HER GO!             

328
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:52,492
        A LITTLE MORE.          

329
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:22,372
                    BREAK IT UP!

330
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,745
                OK, CUT IT!     

331
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:30,280
        WHAT ARE YOU DOING?     

332
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:31,548
                        STOPPING
                        A FIGHT.

333
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:32,865
            WHO ARE YOU?        

334
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,735
                        I'M THE 
                    NEW SHERIFF.

335
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:39,206
                    WE GOT      
                A NEW SHERIFF!  

336
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,774
                LET'S SEE       
                IF HE SCARES    

337
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:49,649
                AS EASY AS      
            THE LAST SHERIFF.   

338
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:51,418
    I WANT ALL YOU PEOPLE       

339
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:52,986
        TO QUIT                 
    DISTURBING THE PEACE.       

340
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,454
    CLEAN UP THIS MESS.         

341
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:56,506
                YES, SIR.       
                ANYTHING ELSE?  

342
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:57,824
        YOUR NAME?              

343
00:22:57,891 --> 00:22:59,609
                JAKE.           

344
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:03,447
        JAKE, GO INTO           
    THE MINT SALOON.            

345
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:05,949
    THERE'S A FELLOW            
IN THERE NAMED JOE DANBY.       

346
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,951
        YOU TELL HIM            
    I REMEMBER HIS NAME,        

347
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,538
        HE'S UNDER              
    ARREST FOR MURDER.          

348
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:12,706
        YOU TALKING             
            TO ME?              

349
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:14,724
        YOU DEAF?               

350
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:18,812
                YOU WANT ME     
                TO TELL HIM     
            HE'S UNDER ARREST?  

351
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:20,814
            WHAT ARE YOU        
        GONNA DO AFTER          
            HE KILLS ME?        

352
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:22,282
                I'LL ARREST HIM 
            FOR BOTH MURDERS.   

353
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,484
            WHERE'S THE JAIL?   

354
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:24,251
FOLLOW ME, SHERIFF.             

355
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,035
            YOU WON'T FIND      
            A BETTER JAIL       
            FOR 200 MILES.      

356
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:45,705
IF YOU                          
CAN FIND ONE.                   

357
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:47,874
                    EVERYTHING  
                SEEMS IN ORDER. 

358
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:50,177
OUR LAST SHERIFF                
WAS A GOOD ORGANIZER.           

359
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:51,911
YELLOW, BUT                     
A GOOD ORGANIZER.               

360
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,447
WE'LL BE                        
GETTING THE BARS                

361
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,047
ANY DAY NOW.                    

362
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,341
THAT OUGHT                      
TO DO IT.                       

363
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:13,743
                THAT OUGHT      
                TO DO WHAT?     

364
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:14,978
TAKE                            
CARE OF IT                      

365
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:22,719
TILL THE                        
BARS ARRIVE.                    

366
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,321
MY THINGS ARE                   
AT THE STABLE.                  

367
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:28,892
I'D LIKE TO GO                  
PICK THEM UP.                   

368
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,195
        I HAVE A ROOM           
    FOR YOU AT MY HOUSE.        

369
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:35,331

I'LL PICK UP THAT DANBY FELLOW. 

370
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,767
THERE'S SOMETHING               
YOU BETTER KNOW                 
ABOUT THE DANBYS.               

371
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,435
        WHY BOTHER              
        THE SHERIFF             
        ABOUT THAT?             

372
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,705
    HE WANTS TO GET SETTLED.    

373
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:45,575
    WE CAN FILL HIM IN          
    AFTER HE'S SETTLED.         

374
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:46,977
    YOU COMING, MAYOR?          

375
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:51,180
I'LL BE                         
RIGHT THERE.                    

376
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,583
THIS IS A                       
LITTLE LIKE MURDER.             
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.           

377
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:57,220
                IT DON'T MEAN   
                    WE'LL LOSE  
                ANOTHER SHERIFF.

378
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:58,889
            OUR LUCK IS         
        BOUND TO CHANGE.        

379
00:25:58,956 --> 00:25:59,556
WHAT ABOUT                      
HIS LUCK?                       

380
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,831

386
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,777
            SHE'S A GOOD COOK   
        AND A FINE LOOKING GIRL.

        DEAR DEPARTED MOTHER.   

388
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,913
HER MOTHER DIED?                

389
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,015
                        NO, SHE 
                JUST DEPARTED.

MOST OF THE FURNITURE           
WAS SHIPPED

    AND CHICAGO.

YOU HAVE SOME.                  

404
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,167
                        WATER?  

405
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,769
        SURE. WE'VE GOT A PUMP  
            INSIDE THE KITCHEN.

        GO TO ARREST            
            JOE DANBY,          

409
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,266
                COUPLE OF THINGS
                YOU SHOULD KNOW.

410
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,201
ALL RIGHT.                      

411
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:27,870
        THERE ARE FOUR DANBYS.  
            FATHER AND 3 SONS.  

412
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:29,372
                        THEY'RE 
                    ALL PRETTY  
                TOUGH CUSTOMERS.

413
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,540
OUTLAWS?                        

414
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,542
                    NOT EXACTLY.

415
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,645
            BUT IN MANY         
        WAYS, THEY'RE           
        LIKE OUTLAWS.           

416
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,113
HOW?                            

417
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:40,250
                        THEY DO 
                AS THEY LIKE.   

418
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:43,219
                        THEY GET
                    NASTY WHEN  
            ANYBODY INTERFERES. 

419
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:46,389
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T WANT ME      

420
00:28:46,457 --> 00:28:48,241
    TO ARREST THIS BOY?         

421
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,877
    NO. IT'S JUST THAT          
    IT'S A NEW IDEA.            

422
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:53,863
IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF        
    GETTING USED TO.            

423
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:56,399
    I STOOD RIGHT THERE         
    IN THAT SALOON              

424
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,368
    AND WATCHED HIM GUN         
A MAN DOWN IN COLD BLOOD.       

425
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,787
I BELIEVE YOU, SHERIFF.         

426
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:03,173
    YOU EXPECT IT FROM JOE.     

427
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,824
    IT WASN'T SELF-DEFENSE?     

428
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:06,776
            NO.                 

429
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:09,378
SOMETIMES THEM THINGS           
    HAPPEN SO FAST.             

430
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:13,349
IT DIDN'T                       
HAPPEN ALL                      
THAT FAST.                      

431
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:17,554
LOOK, MR. PERKINS,              
YOU'RE THE MAYOR.               

432
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:20,122
IF YOU ORDER ME                 
NOT TO ARREST HIM,              

433
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,624
YOU'RE                          
THE BOSS.                       

434
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:23,843
I'LL RETURN                     
THIS BADGE                      

435
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:26,079
        BECAUSE THAT'S          
    NO WAY TO RUN THINGS.       

436
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:28,014
        I AGREE.                

437
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,532
    I COULDN'T AGREE            
        WITH YOU MORE.          

438
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,301
    I'LL EXPECT ALL             
THE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS        

439
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,037
        TO BACK ME UP.          

440
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,521
    THEY WILL, SHERIFF--        

441
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:38,942
        MAYBE NOT ALL           
        OF THEM AT FIRST.       

442
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,743
        LIKE I TOLD YOU,        

443
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,378
        I'M HEADED              
        FOR AUSTRALIA.          

444
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:44,897
            DO WHAT YOU         
        THINK IS BEST.          

445
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:47,600
                    I'LL ALERT  
            EVERYBODY THAT--    

446
00:29:47,668 --> 00:29:49,569
                    WE'RE ALL   
                    BEHIND YOU. 

447
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:51,137
                DON'T GIVE IT   
            ANOTHER THOUGHT.    

448
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,373
                    YOU DON'T   
                    NEED HELP   

449
00:29:53,441 --> 00:29:54,640
                        WITH    
                    JOE DANBY?  

450
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,209
NO. I CAN                       
HANDLE IT.                      

451
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:57,010
                    OH, GOOD.   

452
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:17,012
    YOU'RE THE STRANGEST        
    GIRL I EVER MET.            

453
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,914
            GO AWAY.            

454
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:21,351
    DO YOU ALWAYS SHOW THIS     
PECULIAR SIDE OF YOUR NATURE,   

455
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:25,054
    OR AM I JUST LUCKY          
    MY FIRST DAY IN TOWN?       

456
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:27,223
            I SUPPOSE           
        YOU HAVE REASONS        

457
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,559
    FOR SITTING UP THERE.       

458
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:32,228
    ORDINARILY, A GIRL          
    DOESN'T GET UNDRESSED,      

459
00:30:32,296 --> 00:30:33,630
            POUR WATER          
        OVER HER HEAD,          

460
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:35,031
    AND THEN CLIMB TREES.       

461
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:39,102
        I'M WARNING YOU!        

462
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:40,803
        HI, MRS. DANVERS.       

463
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:43,439
WHAT IN                         
THE WORLD--                     

464
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:45,975
PRUDY, IS THIS                  
MAN BOTHERING YOU?              

465
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:47,443
                    DO YOU KNOW 
                    HER, MA'AM? 

466
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:48,811
OF COURSE.                      

467
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,246
THAT'S                          
PRUDY PERKINS.                  

468
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:51,814
SHE LIVES                       
IN THIS HOUSE.                  

469
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:54,416
                DOES SHE HAVE   
            ANY PAST HISTORY    

470
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:55,885
                    OF STRANGE  
            BEHAVIOR LIKE THIS? 

471
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:58,154
        WHY, NO!                

472
00:30:58,221 --> 00:31:01,658

HAS ALWAYS BEEN                 
A SWEET, NORMAL, LOVABLE...

LAST YEAR...                    

474
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,063
            WHAT HAPPENED       
                LAST YEAR?      

475
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,731
WELL, WASN'T                    
REALLY ANYTHING,                

476
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,600
BUT AT THE                      
ANNUAL TOWN PICNIC,             

477
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,102
SHE GOT                         
HER HAIR CAUGHT                 

478
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,237
IN THE ICE                      
CREAM FREEZER.                  

479
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:20,677
HA HA HA!                       

480
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,212
                    WE OUGHT    
                TO BE MERCIFUL  

481
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,747
                            AND 
                FORGET ABOUT    

482
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:28,417
                    THIS WHOLE  
        UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.   

483
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:30,853
                SEE YOU, MA'AM. 

484
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:40,846
        HA HA HA!               

485
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:44,250
    SHERIFF, I DIDN'T           
            TELL JOE.           

486
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:46,219
WHY NOT?                        

487
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:49,155
            NOBODY'S PAYING     
                    ME TO TAKE  
            CHANCES LIKE THAT.  

488
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:50,890
                YOU NEVER KNOW  
            HOW JOE WILL REACT. 

489
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,293
WHY WORRY                       
ABOUT JOE?                      

490
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,162
    BECAUSE HE'S MEAN           
            AND NASTY.          

491
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,965
                    HE ENJOYS   
                KILLING PEOPLE. 

492
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:00,800
        ALL THEM DANBYS ENJOY   
            THINGS LIKE THAT.   

493
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,868
YOU'RE FASTER                   
THAN JOE.                       

494
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:04,804
                    WHO SAYS SO?

495
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:09,142
I'VE SEEN                       
YOU BOTH DRAW.                  
YOU'RE FASTER.                  

496
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,511
            WHY SHOULD          
            THE MATTER          
        EVER COME UP?           

497
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:16,782
JAKE.

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,952
HOW WOULD                       
YOU LIKE TO                     
BE MY DEPUTY?                   

499
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,421
                    I'D HATE IT.

500
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:24,991
                    EVEN IF     
                I LIVED,        
            I'D HATE IT.

                    HOW MUCH    
        THEY'RE PAYING YOU,     

502
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:30,597
                        BUT IT  
                AIN'T ENOUGH.   

503
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:32,665
                        HE'S    
                EXPECTING YOU.  

504
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:42,609
            SOMEONE TOLD HIM    
            YOU WAS COMING.

GOING TO ARREST ME.             

508
00:33:02,212 --> 00:33:03,780
YOU DON'T LOOK                  
NEAR AS TOUGH                   

509

TOOK THE JOB.                   

512
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,524

        WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:33:55,983 --> 00:34:01,020
                OH, YOU         
                COULD HAVE.     

524
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,823
                IS THIS THE     
                KIND OF TOWN    
            YOU PEOPLE WANT?    

525
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,258
        IS THIS THE             
        KIND OF LIFE            
YOU WANT TO LEAD?               

526
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:08,094
                THREE KILLINGS  
            IN ONE SALOON ALONE.

527
00:34:08,161 --> 00:34:11,030
                THE SUN HASN'T  
                EVEN SET YET!   

528
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:13,733
        ANY MORE FOOLISHNESS,   
        I'LL CLOSE THIS PLACE.  

529
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,834
        YES, SIR.               

530
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:15,902
        I WOULDN'T              
        BLAME YOU.              

531
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,770
                PICK IT UP, JOE.

532
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:25,294
                        GO ON,  
                    PICK IT UP. 

533
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,530
            I'LL GET YOU        
            FOR THIS, JAKE.     

534
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:31,066
            YOU ARE ONE         
            TOUGH-TALKING       
                BLOWHARD.       

535
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:32,835
                    YOU MIGHT   
            AS WELL COME ON.    

536
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,203
                        LIKE IT 
                        OR NOT. 

537
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,038
                WE'RE ON THE    
                SAME SIDE NOW.  

538
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:38,240
                        COME ON.

539
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,610
    EASY, BOYS.                 

540
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,244
            ME AND              
        THE SHERIFF             
    TAKES A DIM VIEW            

541
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:51,521
    OF SHOWOFFS                 
    WITH GUNS.                  

542
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:53,422
REMEMBER, THE SHERIFF           
SAID NO MORE SHOOTING           

543
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,124
TILL THE                        
SUN GOES DOWN.                  

544
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:56,559
                        IS THAT 
                 WHAT HE SAID?  
CLOSE ENOUGH.                   

545
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:03,766
DRINKS ARE                      
ON THE HOUSE!                   

546
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,868
        JAKE, LOOK              
    AROUND THE DESK THERE       

547
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:09,038
                FOR A DEPUTY    
            SHERIFF'S BADGE.    

548
00:35:09,105 --> 00:35:11,206
I NEVER SAID                    
I WAS TAKING NO                 
JOB AS A DEPUTY.                

549
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:13,976
YOU'RE TRYING                   
TO CORNER ME.                   

550
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:16,712
    I'M SURPRISED AT            
    WHAT'S HAPPENING            
            TO ME, TOO.         

551
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,814
I WAS JUST RIDING               
THROUGH ON MY WAY               
TO AUSTRALIA.                   

552
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,716
                    WHERE ARE   
                    YOU GOING?  

553
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:22,785
        THIS IS                 
    PLAIN STUPID.               

554
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:24,453
YOU CALLING                     
THE SHERIFF STUPID?             

555
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:25,821
                DO I HAVE TO    
                LISTEN TO HIM?  

556
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,023
                HE'S JUST THE   
                TOWN CHARACTER. 

557
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,158
WAS THE                         
TOWN CHARACTER.                 

558
00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:31,427
I'M NOW A                       
DEPUTY SHERIFF,                 

559
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:34,864
AND PROBABLY THE SECOND         
    FASTEST GUN HERE.           

560
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,131
                        DID YOU 
                    HEAR THAT?  

561
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,266
            WELL,               
        HE PROBABLY IS.         

562
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,400
        IF HE ISN'T,            
        HE WILL BE              

563
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:39,802
                    AFTER I'VE  
                WORKED WITH HIM 

564
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,337
                        FOR A   
                COUPLE OF DAYS. 

565
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:47,509
                COME ON, JOE.   

566
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,979
JOE, THE RIGHT                  
CELL IS YOURS.                  

567
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,914
WE DON'T HAVE                   
ANY BARS YET.                   

568
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:53,148
                YOU'RE KIDDING. 

569
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,017
THAT'S                          
WHAT I SAID.                    

570
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:57,920
WE'RE GOING                     
TO OPERATE AS IF                
THERE WERE BARS.                

571
00:35:57,988 --> 00:35:59,889
YOU STAY ON                     
THAT SIDE OF THE LINE.          

572
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:02,124
AND EVERYTHING                  
WILL BE FINE.                   

573
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:03,826
                        WHAT?   

574
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:05,761
IN THIS JAIL,                   

575
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:07,697
YOU STAY ON                     
THAT SIDE OF THE LINE           

576
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:11,366
AND WE WILL                     
JUST GET ALONG FINE.            

577
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:15,905
        YOU EXPECT ME           
        TO SIT IN THIS          
            LOUSY CELL--        

578
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:21,343
            WHAT'S THAT         
            RED STUFF ON        
        THE FLOOR THERE?        

579
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,045
THAT'S THE                      
POOR FELLOW                     

580
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:28,935
THAT CROSSED                    
THE LINE EARLIER TODAY.         

581
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:31,470
    JOE, JUST STAY THERE        
    AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.        

582
00:36:31,538 --> 00:36:33,206
    WANT SOMETHING TO READ?     

583
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,374
            READ?               

584
00:36:35,442 --> 00:36:42,314
        NO, I GUESS             
    YOU WOULDN'T. SORRY.        

585
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:43,883
WELL, I SEE YOU                 
FOUND A BADGE.                  

586
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,485
                    YEAH.       

587
00:36:45,552 --> 00:36:47,520
            ARE WE CLEANING     
            UP THIS TOWN?       

588
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:48,855
YEAH,                           
THAT'S ABOUT IT.                

589
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:50,790
                        ALL BY  
                    OURSELVES?  

590
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,393
WE WOULDN'T                     
REFUSE HELP.                    

591
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,962
                NOBODY'S GOING  
                TO OFFER HELP.  

592
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:03,536
        YOU'RE PROBABLY         
        RIGHT, JAKE.            

593
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,772
HOW MUCH                        
MONEY AM I MAKING?              

594
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,807
                        WELL,   
                    LET'S SEE.  

595
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:11,310
                THEY'RE PAYING  
            ME $150 A MONTH.    

596
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:13,513
            SAY YOUR SALARY     
                IS HALF THAT,   

597
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,682
    PLUS ROOM AND BOARD,        
            PLUS AMMUNITION     

598
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,284
                    YOU NEED    
                FOR THE JOB.    

599
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:20,620
                    OF COURSE,  
            I HAVEN'T CHECKED   

600
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:22,422
                WITH THE MAYOR  
            AND TOWN COUNCIL--  

601
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:24,557
        THEY MIGHT              
        TURN ME DOWN?           

602
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,392
            NO,                 
    I DON'T THINK SO.           

603
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,861
        THEIR ATTITUDE          
        WILL LIKELY BE,         

604
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:31,864
        "IF HE'S WILLING        
        TO TAKE THE JOB,        

605
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:33,833
    "DON'T ROCK THE BOAT."      

606
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:40,306
YOU CAN BET                     
THAT'S WHAT THEIR               
ATTITUDE WILL BE.               

607
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:42,107
    EVER BEEN SHERIFF OF        
A TOWN THAT NEEDED CLEANING UP? 

608
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:43,709
            NO.                 

609
00:37:43,777 --> 00:37:45,311
    EVER BEEN A SHERIFF         
    OF ANY KIND OF TOWN?        

610
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:47,046
            NO,                 
        NOT THAT EITHER.        

611
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:51,617
        BUT THE MAYOR           
    THOUGHT I WAS QUALIFIED.    

612
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:55,288
    HE'D THINK THAT             
IF YOU WAS BLIND AND            
CRIPPLED IN BOTH LEGS.          

613
00:37:55,355 --> 00:37:59,325
        YOU'VE GOT              
    THE SITUATION PEGGED.       

614
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:00,993
        WANT ME TO              
    WARM SOME COFFEE?           

615
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:06,131
            I NEVER TURN DOWN   
            A CUP OF COFFEE.    

616
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,834
        HOW LONG YOU            
        BEEN OUT WEST?          

617
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:08,517
        FOUR YEARS.             

618
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:10,152
FROM WHERE?                     

619
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,420
            EAST.               

620
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,190
        I'M FROM INDIANA.       

621
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:18,461
        THAT COULD              
        BE GOOD OR BAD.         

622
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:22,398
YOUR FOUR YEARS OUT WEST,       
    WHAT YOU BEEN DOING?        

623
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:26,335
            MOSTLY MAKING       
        MY WAY TO AUSTRALIA.    

624
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:28,471
        FOR FOUR YEARS?         

625
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:30,939
    SOME TAKE LONGER            
        THAN OTHERS.            

626
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:33,375
    WHAT'S IN AUSTRALIA?        

627
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:36,178
        LOTS OF THINGS.         
    YOU'D BE SURPRISED.         

628
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:37,913
            ANY OTHER           
        QUESTIONS, JAKE?        

629
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:40,616
        AW, I...                

630
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:42,418
                    NO, THAT'S  
                    ALL RIGHT.  

631
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,087
                        I WANT  
                        A DEPUTY

632
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,256
        WHO'S AT EASE           
        IN HIS MIND.            

633
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,758
            WELL,               
        YOU AIN'T GOT ONE.      

634
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:56,398
        YOU WON'T GET           
        ONE AROUND HERE.        

635
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,700
        WHY AUSTRALIA?          

636
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:00,369
        YOU'D KNOW IF YOU       
    EVER READ A BOOK ON IT.     

637
00:39:00,437 --> 00:39:02,438
    I NEVER SEEN ONE.           

638
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,374
                THEY GOT ONE IN 
        THE CHICAGO LIBRARY.    

639
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,376
    IF EVER YOU'RE              
    THERE YOU OUGHT             
    TO TAKE A LOOK.             

640
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:09,245
                        THEY    
                GOT PICTURES.   

641
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,447
THEY GOT LITTLE PEOPLE          
        ABOUT LIKE THAT.        

642
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,182
                    THEY GOT    
                    A STICK     

643
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,650
                THAT WHEN THEY  
                THROW IT AWAY,  

644
00:39:14,717 --> 00:39:16,385
                    IT COMES    
                    RIGHT BACK. 

645
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:20,122
            THEY GOT ONE        
        ANIMAL THAT HOPS        
            AND'LL BOX YOU      

646
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,723
        AND CARRIES THINGS      
            IN ITS TUMMY.       

647
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,840
WHEN YOU SHOT                   
JOE'S FRIEND                    
IN THE BACK,                    

648
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:42,044
YOU FIRED                       
TWO SHOTS.                      

649
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:47,249
I FIGURED THEY                  
WENT IN ABOUT                   
THAT FAR APART.                 

650
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:49,385
PRETTY SLOPPY                   
SHOOTING, JAKE.                 

651
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:50,852
                    WELL, I WAS 
                    IN A HURRY  
            TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.  

652
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,556
                I WASN'T TRYING 
            TO GROUP MY SHOTS.  

653
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:55,558
IF HE'D BEEN FIVE               
FEET FURTHER AWAY,              

654
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,726
YOU'D HAVE                      
MISSED HIM ENTIRELY.            

655
00:39:57,794 --> 00:40:00,996
I'D SAY THAT                    
WAS PRETTY                      
PITIFUL KILLING, JAKE.          

656
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:03,499
SEE THAT                        
BOTTOM NAIL?                    

657
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:08,387
                        YEAH.   

658
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:11,874
        IT'S WEIRD THAT         
        ANYBODY COULD           
        SHOOT LIKE THAT.        

659
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:14,076
IT'S JUST                       
PRACTICE.                       

660
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:16,078
                    HOW COME    
                YOU'RE UNKNOWN? 

661
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:18,948
            A SHOOTER LIKE YOU  
        WHO DRAWS AS FAST AS YOU

662
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:20,682
                    SHOULD HAVE 
                A REPUTATION.   

663
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:25,020
A REPUTATION                    
JUST GETS YOU KILLED.           

664
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,455
YOU GO ON                       
PRACTICING.                     

665
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:27,489
I'LL PUT JOE                    
BACK IN JAIL.                   

666
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,076
JOE.                            

667
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,411
I TOOK THE                      
BULLETS OUT.                    

668
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:51,713
YOU JUST                        
WON'T COOPERATE.                

669
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:52,781
I KEEP LAYING                   
DOWN THE RULES.                 

670
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:55,351
YOU DON'T PAY                   
ANY ATTENTION.                  

671
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:59,238
                WAIT TILL       
            MY PA AND BROTHERS  
            FIND OUT I'M HERE.  

672
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:02,491
I'M LOOKING                     
FORWARD TO MEETIN'              
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.              

673
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:02,875
COME ON.                        

674
00:41:16,623 --> 00:41:20,926
            I WAS HUMILIATED    
        IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS. 

675
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:24,664
            I DOUBT IF          
            YOU HAVE THAT       
            MANY FRIENDS.       

676
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:28,701
THEN I HAVE                     
TO SIT IN JAIL.                 

677
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,737
    PA WILL SKIN                
    ME ALIVE FOR                
    GETTING CAUGHT.             

678
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:33,605
HE DOESN'T MIND                 
YOUR MURDERING,                 

679
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:36,108
JUST DON'T                      
GET CAUGHT?                     

680
00:41:36,176 --> 00:41:39,679
                I DIDN'T MURDER 
                ANYBODY, THAT   
            WAS SELF-DEFENSE.   

681
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:41,830
WE'LL LET                       
THE JUDGE                       
DECIDE THAT.                    

682
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:43,999
WE DO                           
HAVE A JUDGE?                   

683
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:46,935
                    NEVER NEEDED
            ONE TILL YOU COME.  

684
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:48,870
    SPOILED ALL YOUR FUN?       

685
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:52,308
                    YOU CAN SAY 
                    THAT AGAIN. 

686
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:56,545
            OH, THAT'S FUNNY.   

687
00:41:56,613 --> 00:42:00,148
                        THAT'S  
                    REAL FUNNY. 

688
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:02,768
            [Humming]           

689
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,883
GOT ANY                         
RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS           
AGAINST DRINKING, SHERIFF?      

690
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,319
            NOT SINCE GIVING    
            UP MY PARISH.       

691
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,387
                    I'M ONLY    
                KIDDING, MAYOR. 

692
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,423
OH. HA HA!                      

693
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:43,993
                    WHAT ABOUT  
                    MY DEPUTY?  

694
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,295
OK, BUT                         
WHY DID YOU                     
PICK JAKE?                      

695
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,365
            JACK BACKED         
            ME UP WHEN          
            IT COUNTED.         

696
00:42:49,432 --> 00:42:51,767
                        ANOTHER 
                MAN MIGHT NOT.  

697
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,201
                THEN IT MIGHT   
                BE TOO LATE.    

698
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:55,904
                    HOW ABOUT   
                    A JUDGE?    

699
00:42:55,972 --> 00:42:58,540
THE NEED                        
AIN'T EXACTLY                   
BEEN FELT BEFORE.               

700
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:00,376
        JOE SAID THAT.          

701
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:01,443
        BUT, IF I CAN'T         
    APPOINT ONE, WHO CAN?       

702
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,382
        MUST HAVE BEEN          
    SOME SHOW AT THE SALOON.    

703
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,017
    SOBERED UP THE TOWN.        

704
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:44,036
        THAT'S GOOD.            

705
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:46,438
MAYBE,                          
MAYBE NOT.                      

706
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:48,641
IT WAS FUN                      
HERE UP TILL NOW.               

707
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:53,111
EVERYTHING                      
WAS WIDE OPEN.                  

708
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,915
NOBODY LOOKED                   
DOWN ON ANYBODY                 
WHO SHOT SOMEBODY ELSE.         

709
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:59,318
NOBODY POKING                   
THEIR NOSES INTO                
NOBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS          

710
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:03,155
WITHOUT GETTING                 
THEIR NOSES BLASTED OFF.        

711
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,457
NOW THAT WE GOT                 
LAW AND ORDER,                  

712
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:07,259
CHURCHES                        
WILL MOVE IN.                   

713
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:09,562
    THAT'S USUALLY              
    THE NEXT THING              
    THAT HAPPENS.               

714
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:13,199
THEN THE WOMEN                  
WILL FORM COMMITTEES            
AND HAVIN' BAZAARS.             

715
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:15,668
THEY'LL CHASE MADAME            
ORR'S GIRLS OUT                 

716
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:18,637
OR MAKE THEM                    
GET MARRIED OR WORSE.           

717
00:44:18,705 --> 00:44:21,740
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,              
THE LAW IS THE LAW              

718
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:23,842
AND WE ALL HAVE                 
TO FACE UP TO IT.               

719
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,244
    WHEN DID I SAY THAT?        

720
00:44:25,312 --> 00:44:26,778
    YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.       

721
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:29,898
    I WAS BROKE WHEN YOU        
    OFFERED ME THIS JOB.        

722
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:31,733
        YOU DIDN'T              
        HAVE TO TAKE IT.        

723
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,868
        THERE'S DOZENS          
        OF OTHER JOBS.          

724
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:35,304
    WELL, DON'T WORRY.          

725
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:36,505
        I'M NOT GONNA           
        KEEP IT TOO LONG.       

726
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,907
            REMEMBER,           
    I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH    

727
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,109
            ON MY WAY           
            TO AUSTRALIA.       

728
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:41,042
    I'LL DRINK TO THAT.         

729
00:44:57,744 --> 00:44:59,027
    ¶ LA LA LA LA LA ¶          

730
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:00,729
        ¶ LA LA LA ¶            

731
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:02,063
        ¶ LA LA LA LA ¶         

732
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:17,946
            AH!                 

733
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:19,615
        WHAT ARE                
        YOU DOING?              

734
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:21,683
YOU WAS                         
ON FIRE, PRUDY!                 

735
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:27,573
            FIRE?               

736
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,675
    I'M SICK AND TIRED          
    OF THESE STUPID THINGS      

737
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:31,577
    THAT HAPPEN                 
        TO ME!                  

738
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:36,282
SOMEBODY BETTER                 
DO SOMETHING                    
ABOUT IT SOON.                  

739
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:37,349
                THAT'S QUITE    
                A DAUGHTER      

740
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,651
            YOU GOT THERE,      
                MR. MAYOR.      

741
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:40,152
I THINK                         
SHE'S CRAZY.                    

742
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:41,186
                    WHY WOULD   
                YOU THINK THAT? 

743
00:45:41,254 --> 00:45:43,121
I KNOW                          
WHAT I'D THINK.                 

744
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:44,723
SHE'S HAD                       
SOME TERRIBLE                   
SHOCKS THIS YEAR.               

745
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,659
SHE GOT WEALTHY                 
ALMOST OVERNIGHT.               

746
00:45:46,726 --> 00:45:48,594
MAYBE IT                        
UNHINGED HER                    
A LITTLE.                       

747
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,663
THEN SHE                        
WAS ALWAYS                      
BIG FOR HER AGE.                

748
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,364
PUBERTY                         
HIT HER HARD.                   
THAT'LL DO IT.                  

749
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:52,964
                I DIDN'T KNOW-- 

750
00:45:53,032 --> 00:45:55,334
IT WILL!                        

751
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:57,903
AS A DISINTERESTED STRANGER,    
HOW DOES SHE HIT YOU?           

752
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,171
                        WELL... 

753
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:00,939
YOU ARE                         
DISINTERESTED, AIN'T YOU?       

754
00:46:01,007 --> 00:46:04,176
                    YOU COULD   
                SAFELY SAY THAT.

755
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:06,679
SHE'S A RICH                    
LITTLE OLD GAL                  
IN HER OWN NAME.                

756
00:46:06,746 --> 00:46:09,381
SHE OWNS                        
THE MILLARD FRYMORE             
MEMORIAL MINING COMPANY.        

757
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:11,249
    WHOEVER MARRIES HER         
            GETS THE MINE?      

758
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:13,218
SHAFT AND ALL.                  

759
00:46:13,286 --> 00:46:17,456
            THAT WON'T HURT HER 
    IN CERTAIN CIRCLES, WILL IT?

760
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,558
I'D BETTER FRY UP               
SOMETHING TO EAT.               

761
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:20,892
        NO, THANK YOU,          
                MAYOR.          

762
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,227
                    I BETTER GO 
                RELIEVE JAKE.   

763
00:46:22,295 --> 00:46:24,896
        THIS IS HIS FIRST       
            NIGHT ON DUTY.      

764
00:46:24,964 --> 00:46:26,465
                        YOU'RE  
            EXPECTING TROUBLE?  

765
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,333
WHAT DO                         
YOU THINK?                      

766
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,100
                    THE DANBYS. 

767
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:31,637
                    YOU COULD   
                    HAVE WAITED 

768
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:34,440
            BEFORE STIRRING UP  
            THAT HORNET'S NEST. 

769
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:36,442
WHEN CLEANING                   
UP A MESS,                      

770
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:39,578
YOU DON'T JUST                  
LET IT GET BIGGER.              

771
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:41,847
I GUESS                         
YOU KNOW WHAT                   
YOU'RE DOING.                   

772
00:46:41,914 --> 00:46:45,517
                WHAT GIVES YOU  
            THAT IDEA, MAYOR?   

773
00:46:45,585 --> 00:46:46,352
                        PUBERTY.

774
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,424
YOU AIN'T                       
HANDLING THIS                   

775
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:28,260
ALL BY                          
YOURSELF,                       
ARE YOU, PA?                    

776
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:32,064
        DOES IT TAKE            
    MORE THAN ONE DANBY?        

777
00:47:32,131 --> 00:47:34,432
                        YOU ARE 
                        A TIGER.

778
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,034
                    YOU'LL      
                CHARGE IN       
                THERE AND--     

779
00:47:36,102 --> 00:47:37,736
            AND WHAT?           

780
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:40,339
                    I DIDN'T    
                MEAN NOTHING.   

781
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:42,841
    YOU AIN'T GOT               
    BRAINS ENOUGH               
    TO MEAN NOTHING.            

782
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:45,844
            GO ORDER            
            A DRINK.            

783
00:47:45,912 --> 00:47:47,246
        I'LL BE BACK            
    WITH JOE BEFORE             
    YOU CAN FINISH IT.          

784
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:14,723
YOU GOT ONE OF                  
MY CHILDREN HERE.               

785
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,891
                    HOW DARE YOU
            WALK INTO MY OFFICE 

786
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,526
                    AND PULL    
                A GUN ON ME.    

787
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:18,927
GET YOUR FINGER                 
OUT OF THERE.                   

788
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:21,396
                HOW DARE YOU!   

789
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:23,766
TAKE YOUR FINGER                
OUT OF MY GUN.                  

790
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,934
            YOU BETTER TAKE     
                YOUR FINGER     
            OFF THAT TRIGGER.   

791
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:27,502
        AND LET THE HAMMER      
            DOWN REAL SLOW.     

792
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,419
IF THAT                         
GUN WENT OFF,                   

793
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:45,888
IT WOULD                        
HAVE BLOWED                     
UP IN MY FACE.                  

794
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:49,324
            IT WOULDN'T         
            HAVE HELPED         
            MY FINGER.          

795
00:48:49,392 --> 00:48:50,859
    WHAT DO YOU WANT,           
        MR. DANBY?              

796
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,361
        MY SON, JOE.            

797
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,264
    IT SEEMS JOE MURDERED       
    A MAN THIS AFTERNOON.       

798
00:48:56,332 --> 00:48:58,633
            I HEARD             
    IT WAS FAIR GUNFIGHT.       

799
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,802
                        I WAS   
                RIGHT THERE.    

800
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:02,071
WHERE?                          

801
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:05,174
                IN THE SALOON   
            WHEN JOE KILLED HIM.

802
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:07,943
THAT WAS REAL                   
SMART OF HIM.                   

803
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,512
            I'VE BEEN AROUND    
            JOE ALL AFTERNOON,  

804
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,182
        AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM  
        DO ONE SMART THING YET. 

805
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:14,149
                ANYTHING ELSE?  

806
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,018
CAN I SEE HIM?                  

807
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,986
                WHY DIDN'T      
            YOU TAKE THAT       
        APPROACH FIRST?         

808
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:19,254
    HE'S RIGHT IN THERE.        

809
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:20,689
    I'M OBLIGED TO YOU.         

810
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:33,635
        HI, PA.                 

811
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:36,571
        WHAT IS THIS?           

812
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,208
    NO BARS IN THE WINDOW,      
    NO BARS IN THE CELL.        

813
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:42,444
                        NO BARS 
                    NOWHERE.    

814
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:44,146
            WHAT'S KEEPING      
                YOU IN HERE?    

815
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,749
THAT GUY                        
OUT THERE.                      

816
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:50,018
HE WON'T LET ME                 
MOVE TWO INCHES.                

817
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:52,320
HE LIES                         
ABOUT WHETHER                   
MY GUN'S LOADED.                

818
00:49:52,388 --> 00:49:53,755
                WHAT?           

819
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:56,458
ARE YOU                         
GETTING ME OUT?                 

820
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,828
            NEVER MIND THAT.    
            WHO DID YOU KILL?   

821
00:49:59,895 --> 00:50:01,130
I DON'T                         
KNOW HIS NAME.                  

822
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:06,535
HE WAS SOME BUM.                
BESIDES, HE DREW FIRST.         

823
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,770
ARE YOU GONNA BELIEVE ME        
OR THAT LIAR OUT THERE?         

824
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:10,739
                    WHY DON'T   
                YOU SHUT UP?    

825
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:14,042
IT WASN'T                       
ANYBODY THAT WE KNOW.           

826
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,546
        YOU SAID NO JAIL        
        COULD HOLD A DANBY.     

827
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:19,615
                    WELL, NOW   
                THEY BUILT ONE. 

828
00:50:19,682 --> 00:50:21,049
                AW.             

829
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:22,651
                    YEAH, YOU'LL
            HAVE TO STAY HERE   

830
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:23,752
            FOR A COUPLE        
                OF DAYS.        

831
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,355
BUT WE RUN                      
THIS TOWN.                      

832
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:28,457
                I AGREE WITH    
                THAT SHERIFF.   

833
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,261
            YOU DON'T DAZZLE    
                NOBODY WITH     
            YOUR INTELLIGENCE.  

834
00:50:32,328 --> 00:50:34,630
                        YOU SIT 
                    TIGHT HERE  

835
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:39,100
                    TILL I'VE   
                    THOUGHT     
            THIS THING OUT.     

836
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,302
                    COULDN'T YOU
                    HAVE DONE IT

837
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,470
                WHEN THE SHERIFF
                WEREN'T LOOKING?

838
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,439
HE WASN'T                       
THE SHERIFF THEN.               

839
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:46,841
        HEY, I DIDN'T           
    THINK OF THAT BEFORE.       

840
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:47,742
        THAT COULD              
        BE A LOOPHOLE           

841
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,512
    TO HELP ME GET OUT.         

842
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,580
    DON'T YOU TRY TO DO         
NOTHING ABOUT THIS SITUATION.   

843
00:50:52,648 --> 00:51:01,557
                LEAVE THAT TO   
            ME AND THE BOYS.    

844
00:51:01,624 --> 00:51:04,159
THAT'S A                        
LOUSY JAIL.                     

845
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,427
                    WE'RE JUST  
                GETTING STARTED.

846
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,664
        [Door opens]            

847
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:09,898
WHAT'S HE                       
SUPPOSED TO BE?                 

848
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:14,169
                    MY DEPUTY.  

849
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,371
LAST WEEK                       
HE WAS SHOVELING--              

850
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:17,872
HE WAS WORKING                  
IN THE STABLE.                  

851
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,875
                    HE'S BEEN   
                    PROMOTED.   

852
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:22,944
WHAT'S HAPPENED                 
TO THIS TOWN?                   

853
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,258
WHAT DID DANBY WANT?            

854
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,761
                HE JUST CAME IN 
                AND WE TALKED.  

855
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:42,397
            THEN HE WENT IN     
                TO SEE JOE.     

856
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:44,966
            HE CAME BACK OUT,   
            WE TALKED MORE,     

857
00:51:45,034 --> 00:51:48,803
            AND THEN HE LEFT.   

858
00:51:48,871 --> 00:51:53,141
            HE STRIKES ME AS    
            BEING A LONELY MAN. 

859
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:56,745
        LONELY? DANBY?          

860
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:59,180
    HE'S A MEAN, NO-GOOD,       
    LOW-DOWN BUSHWHACKER.       

861
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:05,721
                YOU SEE?        
        NO WONDER HE'S LONELY.  

862
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:07,872
                HE STUCK        
            HIS FINGER WHERE?   

863
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,708
                    SHUT UP.    
        EVERYBODY WILL LOOK.    

864
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:14,379
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.             
YOU HAD YOUR GUN ON HIM?        

865
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:17,182
    I AIN'T EXPLAINING          
            IT AGAIN.           

866
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,217
                I DON'T HAVE TO 
            EXPLAIN NOTHING.    

867
00:52:19,285 --> 00:52:21,253
            INSTEAD OF ASKING   
            STUPID QUESTIONS,   

868
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,487
            WHY DON'T YOU       
                COME UP         

869
00:52:22,555 --> 00:52:25,223
        WITH SOME HELPFUL       
            SUGGESTIONS?        

870
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,225
    WHY DON'T THE THREE OF US   
            GO THERE TOGETHER?  

871
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:29,927
        SO WHAT IF HE IS        
        THE FASTEST GUN?        

872
00:52:29,995 --> 00:52:31,630
                    WHO SAYS    
            HE'S THE FASTEST?   

873
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:33,198
EVERYBODY.                      

874
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:34,999
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT           
    IT ALL OVER TOWN.           

875
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:36,834
WHAT COULD HE DO                
AGAINST THREE OF US?            

876
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:40,338
                KILL TWO OF US. 

877
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:41,739
YOU AIN'T TALKING               
LIKE YOURSELF, PA.              

878
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:43,074
            YEAH.               

879
00:52:43,142 --> 00:52:44,242
    YOU WERE ALWAYS             
        CHARGIN' IN             

880
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:45,277
        WITH US TRYING          
    TO HOLD YOU BACK.           

881
00:52:45,344 --> 00:52:47,462
WE AIN'T                        
LETTING JOE HANG?               

882
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,631
    OF COURSE WE AIN'T.         

883
00:52:49,698 --> 00:52:51,599
    WHO SAYS WE GOTTA           
    TAKE CARE OF                
    THIS SHERIFF?               

884
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,568
            WHO SAYS ANYBODY    
            HAS TO DO IT?       

885
00:52:53,636 --> 00:52:55,037
                WHY DON'T WE    
                RUN HIM OFF     

886
00:52:55,104 --> 00:52:56,238
                    LIKE WE DID 
            THE LAST SHERIFF?   

887
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,741
BECAUSE THIS ONE                
    WON'T GO.                   

888
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:03,412
HE DIDN'T THROW A SCARE         
INTO YOU, DID HE, PA?           

889
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:07,082
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT              
THE WAY IT SOUNDED.             

890
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,152
I MEANT,                        
WHAT DID HE DO?                 

891
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:12,354
            HE MADE ME          
    A LITTLE MORE THOUGHTFUL.   

892
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,889
        WE'RE MAKING            
        A LITTLE MONEY          

893
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,624
    FOR THE FIRST TIME          
        IN OUR LIVES.           

894
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:19,061
    AND THE CHANCE              
    TO GET A LOT MORE.          

895
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:20,695
    IT'S A DUMB TIME            
        TO FIND OUT             

896
00:53:20,763 --> 00:53:22,130
        WHO'S FASTEST           
        WITH A GUN.             

897
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:24,433
    US OR SOME SHOW-OFF         
    THAT MIGHT BE LUCKY,        

898
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,800
        EVEN IF HE              
        WASN'T GOOD.            

899
00:53:25,868 --> 00:53:27,836
WHO'LL HANDLE HIM?              

900
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:29,204
        SOME TRAMP              
    THAT'S GOOD WITH A GUN      

901
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,440
    CAN ALWAYS BE HIRED.        

902
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:35,477
            YOU ALWAYS SAID     
                DANBYS FIGHT    
            THEIR OWN BATTLES.  

903
00:53:35,544 --> 00:53:38,913
        MAYBE I MEANT           
ANOTHER BRANCH OF THE FAMILY.   

904
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,782
        I'M TAKING              
    A LITTLE TRIP TOMORROW.     

905
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,585
                YOU TWO BEHAVE  
                YOURSELVES.     

906
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:47,522
                DON'T MAKE THIS 
            SHERIFF A MARTYR.   

907
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,824
WHAT'S A MARTYR?                

908
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:53,462
    I'M SORRY. THEY DIDN'T USE  
    THAT WORD IN THIRD GRADE?   

909
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:55,230
I DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.          

910
00:53:55,298 --> 00:54:01,403
            AW!                 

911
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,705
YOU REMEMBER WHEN               
I WAS STUCK                     
IN THE SECOND GRADE?            

912
00:54:03,772 --> 00:54:04,772
                    OH, SHUT UP!

913
00:54:18,437 --> 00:54:20,421
            [Prudy]             
            SHERIFF?            

914
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,357
        CAN I TALK TO YOU?      

915
00:54:22,424 --> 00:54:26,361
            SURE, MISS PRUDY.   

916
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:29,764
COULD WE                        
SIT DOWN?                       

917
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:36,104
                        SURE.   

918
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:38,573
                        WELL... 

919
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:40,642
                    HOW CAN I   
                BE OF SERVICE?  

920
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,043
WHAT?                           

921
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:44,078
                    HOW CAN I   
                BE OF SERVICE?

                MEAN ANYTHING.

                THINK I MEAN?

WHAT I SAID.                    

930
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,934
ALL I WANTED                    
WAS TO EXPLAIN                  

931
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,636
SOME OF THOSE                   
SILLY THINGS                    

932
00:55:07,703 --> 00:55:09,404

WHEN I BURNED                   
MY DRESS OFF?                   

935
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:18,847
            WELL, THAT COULD    
            HAPPEN TO ANYONE.   

936
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,582
HOW ABOUT                       
IN THE MUD                      

937
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,819
WHEN I WAS                      
DEFENDING MYSELF                
FROM THAT PERVERT?              

938
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:27,756
    THAT'S SOMETHING            
        THAT ANY OVER           
        STIMULATED GIRL

                HERSELF INTO.   

940
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,794
HOW ABOUT                       
IN THE TREE,                    
HALF NAKED?                     

941
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:37,398
            THAT ONE COULD TAKE 
        A LITTLE EXPLANATION.   

942
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:38,900
IT WAS JUST                     
ONE OF THOSE DAYS               

943
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,735
WHEN EVERYTHING                 
SEEMS TO GO WRONG.              

944
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:42,203
EVERY ONE OF THOSE              
RIDICULOUS THINGS               

945
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:43,872
THAT YOU                        
SAW HAPPEN                      

946
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,676
HAS A PERFECTLY                 
SIMPLE EXPLANATION.             

947
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:49,510
NOT THAT                        
IT MATTERS                      
I JUST THOUGHT                  

948
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:54,749
IT WAS DUMB                     
HAVING SUCH AN AT--             

949
00:55:54,817 --> 00:55:59,754
ATTRACTIVE MAN                  
THINKING I WAS                  
A HOPELESS LOONY.               

950
00:55:59,822 --> 00:56:02,991
                    WELL,       
            LOONY MAYBE,        
            BUT HOPELESS--      

951
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,161
                YOU...YOU THINK 
                I'M ATTRACTIVE? 

952
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:09,898
WELL...                         

953
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:12,266
I DON'T THINK                   
A GIRL WOULD JUST               
CURL UP AND DIE                 

954
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:13,935
BECAUSE YOU                     
SMILED AT HER,                  

955
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:16,805
BUT YES, I THINK                
YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE.              

956
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:18,740
                        WELL,   
                    MISS PRUDY. 

957
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,977
                    I SEE YOU'RE
                    A YOUNG LADY

958
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:23,778
            WHO BELIEVES IN     
            LAYING HER CARDS    
                ON THE TABLE.   

959
00:56:23,846 --> 00:56:25,780
    WHAT?                       

960
00:56:25,848 --> 00:56:27,315
            LAYING HER CARDS    
                ON THE TABLE.   

961
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:28,483
                WHEN A GIRL     
                    DOES THAT,  

962
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,019
                I THINK A MAN   

963
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:34,388
                SHOULD LAY      
            HIS CARDS ON        
            THE TABLE, TOO.     

964
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:39,828
            YOU'RE A VERY PRETTY
            AND ATTRACTIVE GIRL.

965
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:44,232
                ANY MAN WOULD   
                BE ONLY TOO GLAD

966
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:49,137
                    TO TAKE YOU 
                OUT FOR A WALK  
                IN THE EVENING. 

967
00:56:49,204 --> 00:56:54,242
                I'D FEEL        
            PRIVILEGED TO       
            DO JUST THAT.       

968
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:56,745
                HOWEVER, IF     
            YOU'RE THINKING     
            MORE SERIOUSLY,     

969
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:58,579

                    TO WARN YOU

            I DON'T KNOW        
            NOTHING ABOUT       
            HUNTING GOLD.

            THIS STUFF DOWN?

BETTER NOT.

THERE'S GOLD                    
AROUND HERE?                    

1020

        TO A POTBELLIED STOVE.

            HEY, JAKE,          

1027
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,945

        ARGUING ABOUT IT.       

1033

    TO FIND OUT ABOUT A DEPUTY! 

1051

DOWN MY THROAT,

HAVE FOUND OUT                  
LOTS OF THINGS.

    WANT MY BADGE BACK?

DISTURB YOU?

01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,070
                            NO. 

1059
01:01:50,138 --> 01:01:59,146

        YOUR POINT HOME.        

1063

01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:24,739
    GOOD.                       

1065
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,294
THAT BRIGHTENS UP               
THE WHOLE PLACE.                

1066
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:51,098
                    I DON'T FEEL
                    SO STUPID   
                SETTING IN HERE.

1067
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:55,353
    TELL JAKE I WENT            
    TO SEE THE MAYOR.

                SEEN MY DADDY?

    WE HAD THAT LITTLE CHAT.    

1070
01:03:01,526 --> 01:03:05,112
        I'M SURE HE'S           
    PLANNING A JAIL BREAK.      

1071
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:06,748
            YOU THINK SO?       

1072
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:07,882
        WHAT ELSE WOULD         
        THEY BE DOING?          

1073
01:03:33,725 --> 01:03:37,061
                WHERE WILL I    
            FIND THE SHERIFF?   

1074
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:39,397
I IMAGINE                       
HE'S IN THE JAIL--              

1075
01:03:39,465 --> 01:03:41,616

    IN THERE RIGHT NOW, HONEY.

        SEE HIM BEFORE?

    GOOD AFTERNOON, SHERIFF.    

1094
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:12,450
NO DUST TODAY.                  

1095
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:14,051
                ANOTHER ONE     
                    JUST RODE   
                    INTO TOWN.

        YOU CAN'T MISS          
A PROFESSIONAL GUNFIGHTER.      

1098
01:06:18,257 --> 01:06:20,558
        HE'S GOT A LOOK         
ABOUT HIM LIKE NOBODY ELSE      

1099
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:23,093
        AND HE'S BEEN           
    ASKING AROUND FOR YOU.

01:06:23,162 --> 01:06:25,896
I'M SURE GETTING                
SICK OF THIS.                   

1101

        IT WOULD MAKE           
        ME SICK, TOO.

                ARE YOU GOING   
                TO KILL SOMEONE?

01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:53,424
            WE HOPE IT          
        TURNS OUT THAT WAY.     

1106
01:06:53,492 --> 01:06:55,426
    IT'S A CHILDISH WAY FOR     
A GROWN MAN TO MAKE A LIVING.   

1107

AND STAY OUT!                   

1110
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:44,225

    OPENS HIS STUPID MOUTH,     

1111
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:46,494
        I'LL CHASE YOU          
        RIGHT OUT OF TOWN.      

1112
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:04,295
        LEAVE                   
        THE BOTTLE.

1116
01:08:07,766 --> 01:08:09,200
WHAT'S                          
HE DONE?                        

1117
01:08:09,268 --> 01:08:11,969
    HE'S PUSHED ME              
    TOO FAR THIS TIME.          

1118
01:08:12,037 --> 01:08:14,538
    I'VE BEEN BENDING           
    OVER BACKWARDS.             

1119
01:08:14,606 --> 01:08:16,874
    BUT THAT'S                  
    ALL FINISHED.               

1120
01:08:16,942 --> 01:08:18,776

    OVER BACKWARDS.             

1121
01:08:18,843 --> 01:08:20,912
                    HE HASN'T   
                    PUSHED YOU  
                INTO NO CORNER  

1122

        INTO LOSIN' YOUR TEMPER.

1223
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,131
                        WHAT?   

1224
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:44,201
I THOUGHT                       
I MIGHT LEAVE TOWN.             

1225
01:13:44,268 --> 01:13:46,837
GET OUT OF TOWN                 
BEFORE THEY RIDE IN.            

1226
01:13:46,905 --> 01:13:50,657
JUST KEEP                       
ON GOING.                       

1227
01:13:50,725 --> 01:13:51,959
    I DON'T BELIEVE IT.         

1228
01:13:52,026 --> 01:13:54,728
        WHY NOT?                

1229
01:13:54,795 --> 01:13:56,663
I'VE NEVER MADE                 
ANY SECRET OF THE FACT          

1230
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:59,199
THAT I'M ON                     
MY WAY TO AUSTRALIA.            

1231
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:01,134
    I DON'T THINK I'LL FIND     

1232
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:03,636
A BETTER TIME                   
TO GET STARTED                  
THAN RIGHT NOW.                 

1233
01:14:03,704 --> 01:14:11,328
        BESIDES,                
    I DON'T LIKE THE ODDS.      

1234
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:14,298
                I JUST DON'T    
                    BELIEVE IT. 

1235
01:14:14,365 --> 01:14:15,399
YOU BETTER                      
BELIEVE IT.                     

1236
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:16,900
BEFORE TOO                      
MANY HOURS,                     

1237
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:20,704
YOU'LL LOOK UP                  
AND I'LL BE GONE.               

1238
01:14:20,772 --> 01:14:24,274
                THAT'S ONE      
                OF THE MOST     
                MATURE THINGS   

1239
01:14:24,342 --> 01:14:27,577
                I'VE EVER HEARD 
                OF A MAN DOING. 

1240
01:14:27,645 --> 01:14:29,613
YOU THINK                       
IT'S WHAT?                      

1241
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:32,749
                        MATURE. 

1242
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:35,118
                ANY OTHER MAN   
            WOULD STICK AROUND  

1243
01:14:35,186 --> 01:14:36,653
                    TO PROVE    
                    HE'S A MAN  

1244
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,189
            AND GET A WHOLE     
                TOWN SHOT UP.   

1245
01:14:39,256 --> 01:14:41,625
MATURE?                         

1246
01:14:41,693 --> 01:14:44,795
                        MATURE, 
                    AS OPPOSED  
                    TO CHILDISH.

1247
01:14:44,862 --> 01:14:47,631
YOU DON'T THINK                 
IT SOUNDED COWARDLY?            

1248
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:49,966
        I MEAN, I TAKE          
        A JOB AND THEN          

1249
01:14:50,034 --> 01:14:51,668
WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH,      

1250
01:14:51,736 --> 01:14:54,237
        I SNEAK OUT             
    IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.       

1251
01:14:54,305 --> 01:14:56,573
                YOU DIDN'T SAY  
            THE DAY OR NIGHT.   

1252
01:14:56,641 --> 01:14:59,209
        BUT THE POINT IS        

1253
01:14:59,276 --> 01:15:01,044
        DIDN'T IT SOUND         
    A LITTLE COWARDLY TO YOU?   

1254
01:15:01,111 --> 01:15:05,349
        NO, IT SOUNDS MATURE.   

1255
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:07,735
IT SOUNDED                      
A LITTLE COWARDLY               
TO ME JUST NOW.                 

1256
01:15:07,802 --> 01:15:09,569
                    IT'S MATURE.

1257
01:15:09,637 --> 01:15:11,004
I KNOW                          
IT'S COWARDLY                   

1258
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:12,206
BECAUSE I'VE                    
NEVER DONE                      

1259
01:15:12,273 --> 01:15:13,373
A COWARDLY THING                
IN MY LIFE,                     

1260
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,109
NO MATTER                       
WHAT YOU THINK.                 

1261
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:16,409
                    I DIDN'T--  

1262
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:18,979
IT ISN'T MATURE.                
IT IS COWARDLY.                 

1263
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:21,949
LET'S JUST CALL                 
THINGS BY THEIR NAME.           

1264
01:15:22,016 --> 01:15:24,484
    WHAT IS THE MATTER?         

1265
01:15:24,552 --> 01:15:27,687
I'M SURPRISED                   
YOU'RE THROWING                 
YOURSELF AT A MAN               

1266
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,656
    YOU THINK IS A COWARD.      

1267
01:15:29,724 --> 01:15:31,008
        GO BACK TO TOWN.        

1268
01:15:31,075 --> 01:15:33,276
                        WHAT DO 
                    YOU MEAN    

1269
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:34,677
                    THROWING    
                MYSELF AT YOU?  

1270
01:15:34,745 --> 01:15:38,482
DID YOU REALLY                  
THINK I'D RUN?                  

1271
01:15:38,549 --> 01:15:41,284
                    THAT'S WHAT 
                YOU JUST SAID.  

1272
01:15:41,352 --> 01:15:42,552
I'M NOT                         
GOING TO,                       

1273
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,686
SO YOU JUST                     
FORGET ABOUT IT.                

1274
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:13,266
                ALL RIGHT.      

1275
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:16,169
                    ORDER!      
                    ORDER!      

1276
01:16:16,237 --> 01:16:18,405
                YOU HEARD       
                THE MOTION.     

1277
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,474
            THOSE IN FAVOR,     
            RAISE YOUR HANDS.   

1278
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,625
                COUNT, HENRY.   

1279
01:16:21,693 --> 01:16:25,128
            1, 2, 3, 4,         

1280
01:16:25,196 --> 01:16:26,897
                5.              

1281
01:16:26,965 --> 01:16:29,099
            NOW,                

1282
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,902
THOSE IN FAVOR                  
OF NOT GETTING INVOLVED         
IN THIS CRISIS                  

1283
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:34,938
    ABOUT TO BEFALL ON          
    OUR FAIR COMMUNITY.         

1284
01:16:35,006 --> 01:16:37,874
        KEEPING THE HELL        
        OFF THE STREETS         
    TILL THE SHOOTING IS OVER,  

1285
01:16:37,942 --> 01:16:39,342
        RAISE YOUR HANDS.       

1286
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:40,961
        COUNT 'EM, HENRY.       

1287
01:16:41,028 --> 01:16:43,847
            5, 10, 15...        

1288
01:16:43,915 --> 01:16:46,016
            I THINK WE          
        PASSED THE MOTION.      

1289
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:48,218
            ORDER!              

1290
01:16:48,285 --> 01:16:50,954
            ENTER IT            
        IN THE BOOKS            

1291
01:16:51,022 --> 01:16:53,690
THAT THE MAJORITY HAS RULED     

1292
01:16:53,758 --> 01:16:54,625
    AND AS YOUR MAYOR--         

1293
01:16:54,692 --> 01:16:56,093
            [Gunshot]           

1294
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,294
I OBJECT!                       

1295
01:16:58,362 --> 01:17:02,065
        GET THAT GUN            
        AWAY FROM HER.          

1296
01:17:02,133 --> 01:17:03,734
    YOU CAN'T DO THIS.          

1297
01:17:03,801 --> 01:17:05,401
                        SHUT UP 
                AND SIT DOWN.   

1298
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:07,303
        THIS IS A MEETING       
        OF THE TOWN COUNCIL,    

1299
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:10,040
            WITH CERTAIN        
        PROMINENT CITIZENS.     

1300
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:12,843
        YOU CAN'T WALK IN       
        AND INSULT EVERYONE.    

1301
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,611
            I HAVE              
        ONE QUESTION.           

1302
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:16,246
            WILL YOU            
        HELP THE SHERIFF        

1303
01:17:16,313 --> 01:17:17,313
            AGAINST             
        THE DANBYS?             

1304
01:17:17,381 --> 01:17:19,883
IT'S NOT                        
AS SIMPLE                       
AS THAT.                        

1305
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:21,351
            WHY NOT?            

1306
01:17:21,418 --> 01:17:24,454
THERE ARE                       
ECONOMIC FACTORS                
TO CONSIDER.                    

1307
01:17:24,522 --> 01:17:27,658
IT COULD AFFECT                 
THE WHOLE TOWN.                 

1308
01:17:27,725 --> 01:17:30,493
    I HEARD THE SHERIFF         
        IS LEAVING TOWN.        

1309
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:35,749
YES, AND THE SHERIFF'S HEAD     
SETS SQUARELY ON HIS SHOULDERS. 

1310
01:17:35,816 --> 01:17:38,001
        NOW HE'S NOT            
        LEAVING TOWN.           

1311
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:40,671
        I WANT TO KNOW          
        WHO CAUSED HIM          

1312
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:42,939
    TO CHANGE HIS MIND.         

1313
01:17:43,007 --> 01:17:46,176
        THAT MAN HAD            
        A GOOD IDEA.            

1314
01:17:46,243 --> 01:17:47,544
        WHAT IS THE             
        MATTER WITH YOU?        

1315
01:17:47,611 --> 01:17:49,546
        WE WAITED SO LONG       

1316
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:52,182
    FOR A MAN WHO WOULD         
    STAND UP TO THE DANBYS.     

1317
01:17:52,249 --> 01:17:53,684
    DO YOU REMEMBER             
WHAT THIS TOWN WAS LIKE         
    BEFORE THE SHERIFF?         

1318
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:57,654
    MURDERING, LYNCHING,        
MINERS SHOOTING UP THE TOWN,    

1319
01:17:57,722 --> 01:17:59,455
                    ASIDE FROM  
                THE FEW THINGS  
                YOU MENTIONED,  

1320
01:17:59,523 --> 01:18:01,257
                    IT WASN'T   
                A BAD PLACE.    

1321
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:04,561
        THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS   
        WITH THE DANBYS         

1322
01:18:04,628 --> 01:18:06,863
        COULD BE                
        WORKED OUT.             

1323
01:18:06,931 --> 01:18:09,082
WHAT ABOUT                      
JOE DANBY'S                     
MURDER CHARGE?                  

1324
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:14,504
    THAT WOULD SOLVE ITSELF     
    IF THE SHERIFF LEFT TOWN.   

1325
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:16,472
        I SAID IT BEFORE        
    AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN,      

1326
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:18,008
    THE MEN IN THIS TOWN        

1327
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:21,328
ARE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF      
MISERABLE, COWARDLY CURS.       

1328
01:18:21,395 --> 01:18:24,264
                AS YOUR FATHER, 
            I HAVE TO TAKE THAT.

1329
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:25,265
            BUT AS THE          
        MAYOR OF THIS TOWN,     

1330
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,468
    I SURE AS HELL DON'T.       

1331
01:18:27,535 --> 01:18:29,470
    THROW HER OUT, BOYS!        

1332
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:37,578
        AND DON'T BE TOO        
        GENTLE WITH HER.        

1333
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:42,282
    DON'T LET HER TIE           
    HERSELF TO THE POST!        

1334
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,350
IT'S A TRICK                    
OF HERS,                        

1335
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:51,291
TYING HERSELF                   
TO THINGS.                      

1336
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,027
    DEATH TO ALL TYRANTS!       

1337
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:55,496
                    WHAT DID    
                    SHE SAY?    

1338
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:58,232
SHE SAID DEATH                  
TO SOMEBODY OR OTHER.           

1339
01:18:58,299 --> 01:19:00,867
SHE ALWAYS                      
SAYS DEATH                      
TO SOMEBODY SHE'S MAD AT.       

1340
01:19:00,935 --> 01:19:02,435
ORDER! ORDER!                   

1341
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,920
FORGET ABOUT                    
GETTING HELP                    
FROM THIS TOWN,                 

1342
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:21,722
OR FROM ANYBODY                 
FOR 100 MILES AROUND.           

1343
01:19:21,789 --> 01:19:24,892
            THAT'S JUST         
        ABOUT EVERYBODY.        

1344
01:19:24,959 --> 01:19:27,093
        THEY CAN THROW          
    GIRLS OUT OF MEETINGS       

1345
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:28,729
        BUT THEY CAN'T          
    DEFEND THEIR OWN TOWN       

1346
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:31,882
    AGAINST A BUNCH             
    OF CUTTHROATS.              

1347
01:19:31,949 --> 01:19:33,650
WHAT ARE WE                     
GOING TO DO NOW?                

1348
01:19:33,717 --> 01:19:34,751
                            WE? 

1349
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:37,387
            DON'T TURN          
            DOWN HELP.          

1350
01:19:37,454 --> 01:19:38,655
        HOW IS JOE?             

1351
01:19:38,722 --> 01:19:42,625
            HE FIGURES          
        HE'LL BE OUT SOON.      

1352
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:45,929
        DID HE SEEM SORRY       
    THAT WE MIGHT BE KILLED?    

1353
01:19:45,997 --> 01:19:47,463
            NO.                 

1354
01:19:47,531 --> 01:19:50,466
        HE PLANNED              
    TO SPIT ON OUR GRAVES.      

1355
01:19:50,534 --> 01:19:52,635
    THAT SOUNDS LIKE JOE.       

1356
01:19:52,703 --> 01:19:54,905
        LEAVING TOWN            
        WAS A GOOD IDEA.        

1357
01:19:54,972 --> 01:19:56,673
    YOU DON'T HAVE              
        TO STAY.                

1358
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,342
        YES, I DO.              
        I TOOK THE JOB.         

1359
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,244
        SO DID I.               

1360
01:20:01,312 --> 01:20:03,513
    I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.         

1361
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,982
    I'LL GO TO AUSTRALIA        
    WITH YOU IF WE LEAVE NOW.   

1362
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:08,351
            WE'LL GO            
        TO AUSTRALIA,           

1363
01:20:08,419 --> 01:20:11,654
        BUT FIRST WE GOT        
    A FEW THINGS TO DO.         

1364
01:20:11,823 --> 01:20:13,740
                PRUDY, WOULD    
                YOU STILL HELP? 

1365
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:14,841
SURE.                           

1366
01:20:14,909 --> 01:20:16,009
                    THE FIRST   
                    THING TO DO 

1367
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,078
                    IS GET JOE  
                OUT OF HERE.    

1368
01:20:18,145 --> 01:20:20,330
            I GOT A COUPLE      
                OF IDEAS,       

1369
01:20:20,397 --> 01:20:23,099
        WE MIGHT LIVE           
    THROUGH THIS THING.         

1370
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:24,367
                I SURE LIKED    
        HIS IDEA ABOUT LEAVING. 

1371
01:20:49,076 --> 01:20:50,477
                    YOU GO IN   
                THE COURTHOUSE. 

1372
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,880
                    DO YOU KNOW 
                HOW TO USE THIS?

1373
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:57,551
                HERE, YOU'LL    
                NEED THESE.     

1374
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:58,385
            JAKE,               
        ARE YOU THERE?          

1375
01:20:58,453 --> 01:20:59,353
            YEAH.               

1376
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:00,387
YOU KNOW                        
WHAT TO DO?                     

1377
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,589
            OH, YEAH!           

1378
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:08,328
    [Mutters] KEEP OUT OF       
        THE LINE OF FIRE.       

1379
01:21:08,395 --> 01:21:09,462
        MAYOR...                

1380
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:10,697
                CAN'T TALK      
                NOW, SHERIFF.   

1381
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:16,569
        WE HAVE                 
        AN EMERGENCY            
        MEETING.                

1382
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:18,138
    WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?      

1383
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:19,640
        I WON'T SHOOT           
    THROUGH THE WINDOW.         

1384
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:12,676
TAKE CARE                       
OF THESE,                       
MY EATING TEETH.                

1385
01:22:12,743 --> 01:22:13,944
I DON'T WANT TO                 
GET THEM SHOT UP.               

1386
01:22:26,423 --> 01:22:27,390
                    GET JOE.    

1387
01:22:38,402 --> 01:22:39,368
    HE AIN'T IN THERE.          

1388
01:22:39,436 --> 01:22:41,270
            HOLD IT!            

1389
01:22:41,338 --> 01:22:43,974
    YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.        

1390
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:45,174
        THROW DOWN YOUR GUNS    
AND I'LL ACCEPT YOUR SURRENDER. 

1391
01:23:50,141 --> 01:23:51,908
                CAN'T YOU JUST  
                WOUND SOMEBODY? 

1392
01:23:51,976 --> 01:23:55,912
I ONLY                          
SHOOT TO KILL.                  

1393
01:23:55,980 --> 01:24:02,201
                WE DON'T        
            WANT A MASSACRE.    

1394
01:24:02,269 --> 01:24:03,069
            HOLD IT!            

1395
01:24:03,137 --> 01:24:06,540
        HOLD IT!                

1396
01:24:06,607 --> 01:24:08,107
        JUST HOLD IT!           

1397
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:29,512
            GO AHEAD!           

1398
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:30,547
                    WHERE'S JOE?

1399
01:24:30,614 --> 01:24:35,285
UPSTAIRS.                       

1400
01:24:35,352 --> 01:24:36,319
        GO GET HIM.             

1401
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,283
                    PA, LOOK.   

1402
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:53,086
                    YOUR TEETH  
                SAVED MY LIFE.  

1403
01:24:53,153 --> 01:24:55,021
ALWAYS WORRYING                 
ABOUT YOURSELF.                 

1404
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:57,591
HOW AM I                        
SUPPOSED                        
TO CHOW NOW?                    

1405
01:24:57,658 --> 01:24:58,792
            LOOK!               

1406
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:39,833
I WANT YOU                      
TO UNSTRAP                      
YOUR GUN BELTS                  

1407
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,869
AND THROW                       
YOUR RIFLES DOWN,               

1408
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:46,072
OR I'M GOING                    
TO SET THIS OFF.                

1409
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,808
YOU CAN'T BLUFF                 
ME OUT WITH THAT                
OLD CANNON.                     

1410
01:25:48,876 --> 01:25:52,412
        IT AIN'T                
        EVEN LOADED.            

1411
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:53,312
SHALL WE SEE?                   

1412
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:55,649
                BELIEVE HIM, PA!

1413
01:25:55,716 --> 01:26:02,088
    STAY OUT OF                 
    THIS, YOU                   
MISERABLE COWARD.               

1414
01:26:02,156 --> 01:26:03,572
        WHAT'S IT GOING         
        TO BE, DANBY?           

1415
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:24,760
JAKE, LET                       
JOE LOOSE.                      

1416
01:26:24,829 --> 01:26:26,762
                    PUT THE REST
        OF THAT BUNCH IN JAIL.  

1417
01:26:26,831 --> 01:26:29,432
BY MYSELF?                      

1418
01:26:29,499 --> 01:26:30,466
I'LL BE                         
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.               

1419
01:26:41,712 --> 01:26:43,579
                WERE YOU        
            REALLY GOING        
        TO BLOW HIM UP?         

1420
01:26:43,647 --> 01:26:46,682
THAT THING                      
ISN'T LOADED.                   

1421
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:51,654
I JUST STUCK                    
THAT FAKE FUSE IN THERE.        

1422
01:26:51,722 --> 01:26:52,455
SEE?                            

1423
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:28,941
            WOW!                

1424
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,776
        MY BUSINESS!            

1425
01:27:30,844 --> 01:27:38,818
I'LL FIND OUT                   
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE               
FOR THIS, MADAME ORR.           

1426
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:43,406
DISTURBING THE PEACE,           
    THAT'S WHAT IT IS.          

1427
01:27:43,474 --> 01:27:45,841
        I DON'T CARE            
    IF YOU'RE CLEANING          
        UP THIS TOWN.           

1428
01:27:45,909 --> 01:27:47,109
            THAT WAS            
            A TERRIBLE          
            THING TO DO         

1429
01:27:47,177 --> 01:27:49,011
                TO THEM POOR    
            UNFORTUNATE GIRLS.  

1430
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:51,113
        I DIDN'T KNOW           
THAT THING WAS LOADED.          

1431
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:52,482
        I'VE NEVER              
        DONE ANYTHING           

1432
01:27:52,549 --> 01:27:53,416
        TO AN UNFORTUNATE       
        GIRL IN MY LIFE.        

1433
01:27:53,484 --> 01:27:55,017
                            AW!

    ARE MY FRIENDS.             

1435
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:32,171

            IT'S THE SHERIFF.   

1436
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,208
        IT'S THE                
        SHERIFF, BOYS.

                OUR SHERIFF IS.

I GUESS HE' S                   
RIGHT AT THAT.                  

1440
01:28:40,547 --> 01:28:42,915
YOU'RE ABOUT THE                
MOST POPULAR CITIZEN

                    TO HEAR.    

1443
01:28:46,419 --> 01:28:47,419
    WE'RE THINKING              
    ABOUT SENDING

HEAD THAT DELEGATION.

1447
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:56,528
            YOU WANT SOMEBODY   
            WHO WILL BE HERE.   

1448
01:28:56,596 --> 01:28:58,998
IF YOU'RE                       
UPSET WITH US                   

1449

DANBY BUSINESS--

                WE WERE         
            BEHIND YOU          
        ALL THE WAY, SHERIFF.   

1451
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:05,121
    I CAN SEE IT MIGHT NOT      
    HAVE  LOOKED THAT WAY.      

1452
01:29:05,189 --> 01:29:08,591
    NO, THAT'S NOT IT.          

1453
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:10,527
        I'VE NEVER              
        HIDDEN THE FACT         

1454
01:29:10,594 --> 01:29:13,362
    THAT I'M GOING              
    TO AUSTRALIA.

        WHICH REMINDS ME,       

1456
01:29:15,282 --> 01:29:17,049
    I'M GOING TO THINK          
ABOUT GETTING STARTED AGAIN     

1457
01:29:17,117 --> 01:29:18,151
    ONE OF THESE DAYS.          

1458
01:29:36,303 --> 01:29:38,871
    WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?        

1459
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:44,043
    A SMALL CRISIS              
NEEDS TO BE HANDLED.            

1460
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:45,945

        YOU TO KNOW THAT

        PICKING ON MY GIRL.     

1465
01:30:06,784 --> 01:30:09,351
        WE HAD NO IDEA.         

1466
01:30:09,419 --> 01:30:10,920
            NOW YOU KNOW IT.    

1467

            WORD AROUND.

                MEAN YOUR GIRL? 

1470
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:21,464
FOR ONCE, KEEP                  
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.                

1471
01:30:21,531 --> 01:30:22,665

                    OF THIS.

01:30:22,733 --> 01:30:24,834
                        WHAT DO 
                    YOU MEAN?   

1473
01:30:24,902 --> 01:30:26,335
            YOU'VE HAD THAT     
            LOOK IN YOUR EYE    

1474
01:30:26,403 --> 01:30:28,304
            SINCE I             
            HIT TOWN.           

1475
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:30,740
            LET'S HAVE A        
            LITTLE AGREEMENT.   

1476
01:30:30,807 --> 01:30:33,610
AFTER                           
WE'RE MARRIED,                  

1477
01:30:33,677 --> 01:30:35,144
WHEN I SAY                      
WE'RE OFF TO AUSTRALIA,         

1478
01:30:35,212 --> 01:30:38,180
WE PACK                         
UP AND GO.                      

1479
01:30:38,249 --> 01:30:40,583
                    WHY WOULD I 
                GO TO AUSTRALIA?

1480
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:44,820
THAT'S WHERE YOUR               
HUSBAND WOULD BE.               

1481
01:30:44,888 --> 01:30:49,259
                            OH.

            PUT IT THAT WAY...  

1483
01:30:51,962 --> 01:30:55,465
                WHY DON'T YOU   
                PUT ME DOWN?    

1484
01:30:55,532 --> 01:30:57,767
OH, I LIKE                      
IT LIKE THIS.                   

1485
01:30:57,834 --> 01:31:01,837

TO WALK YOU HOME?               

1486
01:31:01,905 --> 01:31:05,691

                    WANT TO.    

1487
01:31:05,759 --> 01:31:08,160
    SO...

ONE OF THE RICHEST GIRLS        
AROUND HERE?

WELL, THAT'S NICE.              
THAT'S REAL NICE.               

1491
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:23,292
        NOW, THE WAY            
        THIS STORY ENDS         

1492
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,928
        IS THAT THEY            
        GET MARRIED.

        HE BECOMES              
    GOVERNOR OF THE STATE.

        TO AUSTRALIA,

        BUT HE READS            
    A LOT OF BOOKS ABOUT IT.    

1496
01:31:35,305 --> 01:31:38,774
        I GET TO BE             
    SHERIFF OF THIS TOWN,       

1497
01:31:38,842 --> 01:31:41,277
