00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:29,816
[Beau] Rooster, you home?

7
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,693
[Rooster] Yes, sir. Living room!

8
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:33,361
I thought you were gonna
take a look at that tractor

9
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:34,445
and try and see what was...

10
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,030
Check it out. [sighs]

11
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:37,616
Colt's home.

12
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,493
What the hell are you doing here?

13
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:44,122
I thought you were up in Canada
playing amateur's football.

14
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:47,917
Uh, semi-pro. Yeah, I was playing
for the Saskatoon Cold.

15
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,629
It's like the Miami Heat, except...

16
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:51,963
you know, cold.

17
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,258
Yeah, we know.

18
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,593
We also heard you got arrested

19
00:01:56,676 --> 00:01:59,679
for flashing Shania Twain
while you were up there.

20
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:02,891
[scoffs] How'd you even hear about that?

21
00:02:02,974 --> 00:02:04,726
[chuckles] It was in the paper.

22
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:08,938
"Former high school phenom
Colt Bennett shows Shania his Twain."

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,528
First time you made the front page
since the state finals.

24
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:17,155
I put it on the fridge.

25
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:19,157
All right, listen to this.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,662
I... They got this hotel up there
made entirely of ice, okay?

27
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,665
And so, I'm a little drunk, and I...

28
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:30,669
and I see this sweet ice sculpture
of Wayne Gretzky.

29
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:34,213
And naturally, I think,
I could take a wizz on him.

30
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,008
It's like when you go
to the fancy restaurant

31
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:38,467
and they put the ice in the pisser.

32
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:40,219
You know, you get to spray it up
and melt it down.

33
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:41,345
[Colt chuckles] Yeah.

34
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:44,933
So, I'm taking a piss
in The Great One's mouth.

35
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:48,144
And I almost got a hole all the way
through the back of his head.

36
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:51,647
He shoots, he scores.

37
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:53,066
[chuckles]

38
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:55,401
When I slip...

39
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:59,781
Bam! I slide balls first
into Miss Shania Twain.

40
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:04,577
Did she look down and say,
"That don't impress me much"?

41
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:10,666
No. She said,
"That makes me feel like a woman."

42
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,755
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:19,968
What? Can't just stop in
and say hi to my family?

44
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,261
I remember last time you stopped by.

45
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:24,889
Said you were done with football.

46
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:27,266
You wanted to start
helping out around here.

47
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:29,853
How long ago was that, Rooster?

48
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:31,604
About six years?

49
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:33,732
Yes, sir. It was on my birthday.

50
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,609
We were all supposed to go to dinner
but you guys just fought the whole time.

51
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:39,696
Hey, I got ten bucks anyone
in here knows how old I am.

52
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,702
Then you snuck out of here
in the middle of the night.

53
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:46,953
Took your brother's truck.

54
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:49,998
- Left the damn gate open.
- Okay, that wasn't my fault.

55
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:53,084
Rooster was chasing after me yelling,
"That's my truck!"

56
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,713
And so, I just assumed
he was gonna close it.

57
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:59,382
Our cows were all over town.

58
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,927
I found one of 'em standing
in the Sizzler parking lot

59
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,388
just staring at a poster of a rib-eye.

60
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,436
I'm 35.

61
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:21,445
What the fuck's on your feet?

62
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:27,952
They're boots.

63
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,246
Those are not boots.

64
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,540
They're Uggs.

65
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,752
That's Australian for "boots."

66
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,798
They're ladies' shoes.

67
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,551
Well, Tom Brady wears 'em.

68
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,387
Yeah, well, Tom Brady
gets away with a lot of shit.

69
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,350
Fine. You know what? That's...

70
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,394
You made fun of my clothes,

71
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:56,480
you made fun of my career,
you made fun of my childhood.

72
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,149
You got anything else
you wanna take a shot at?

73
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,109
That's a stupid haircut.

74
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:02,946
All right. You know what?

75
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,197
This was a bad idea.

76
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,990
I can't stay here with him,
he's impossible.

77
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:07,325
Same old Colt,

78
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,911
"I can't stay here, he's impossible."

79
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:12,997
"I can't stay in this school,
the coach won't let me start."

80
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:16,542
"I can't stay with this girl.
She doesn't like it when I cheat on her."

81
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,294
Well, speaking of women
who don't like being cheated on,

82
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:19,462
how's Mom doing?

83
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:23,007
All right, this is getting good.

84
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,258
I'm gonna grab a beer.

85
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:25,802
No punches till I get back.

86
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,474
Don't go making accusations
when you don't know the whole story.

87
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:32,892
Oh, really?

88
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:34,768
What's the whole story, Dad?

89
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:36,812
That's none of your damn business.

90
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:39,023
There we go. There we go.

91
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:40,108
Why are you here?

92
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,692
I got a tryout...

93
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,320
with a new semi-pro team in Denver.

94
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:46,614
And I just need a place to stay
for a couple days.

95
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:48,449
As soon as I make the team,
I'm out of here.

96
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:50,952
Are you kiddin' me?

97
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,996
Are you still chasing this dream?

98
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,663
I'm a football player.

99
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:57,708
You're not a football player, Colt.

100
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,129
You're a guy dreamin'
about being a football player.

101
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:02,463
You're 34.

102
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:04,840
Oh, sure, you know how old he is.

103
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,638
Uh, 34 is still young to be a quarterback.

104
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,932
That's your three concussions talking.

105
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:15,726
[scoffs] I don't remember
three concussions.

106
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:19,147
You know, has it ever crossed your mind

107
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,690
that you might not be right
about everything?

108
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:25,403
'Cause you were just as sure
when you said the moon landing was fake.

109
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,822
A flag cannot ripple
in the vacuum of space.

110
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:31,910
Well, you're wrong about me.

111
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:34,870
I can still make it.
I just need a chance.

112
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:37,165
Every opportunity you've had...

113
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:40,834
I'm talking about high school,
college, and the pros...

114
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,006
you've either smoked it or drank it
or screwed it away.

115
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,841
Well, next time it'll be different.

116
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:49,969
They ought to put that on your tombstone.

117
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,305
"Here lies Colt Bennett.

118
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:54,140
Next time it'll be different.

119
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,935
He died wearing lady boots."

120
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,898
[indistinct chatter]

121
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:06,069
Seriously? I can't even
shut a truck door right?

122
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:07,653
I'm sure you could.

123
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:10,406
Why you choose not to is beyond me.

124
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,076
Hey, I'm gonna hit the head.

125
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:15,244
But in case you guys
run out of things to fight about...

126
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,956
Colt's jeans cost 85 bucks.

127
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,921
What kind of dipshit pays 85 bucks
for a pair of jeans?

128
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:26,589
My work is done.

129
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:30,551
Hey, bartender...

130
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:33,137
can we get a couple of cold ones, please?

131
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:35,098
Not a chance, Beau.

132
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,765
Not even for your favorite son?

133
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,101
Colt?

134
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,227
[laughs] Hi, Mama.

135
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,145
Don't you "Hi, Mama" me.
Give me a hug.

136
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:42,480
- Aw! [grunting]
- [squeals]

137
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,065
You're a sight for sore eyes.

138
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:47,901
Especially now since you cut your hair
and shaved off that stupid goatee.

139
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:49,570
Oh, no. That was a playoff beard.

140
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:51,990
You know I can't grow here.

141
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,159
You ready for your tryout?

142
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:57,078
You knew about this?

143
00:07:57,161 --> 00:08:01,040
Yeah, I stay in touch with my son.
You should try it.

144
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,334
Can we just get those beers?

145
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,295
You have any complaints about the service,
take it up with the owner.

146
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,714
The owner's kind of a pain in my ass.

147
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:13,011
That's why the owner lives
in her own Airstream now.

148
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,016
What time you leaving tomorrow?

149
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,808
Oh, early. Tryout's at 2:00.

150
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:21,685
About the time I'll be getting a beer.

151
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:26,857
Once you're on that team,
I'll make the drive every Sunday.

152
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,817
Oh, uh, the games aren't on Sunday.

153
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:32,030
Sunday's reserved for
the high school girls' lacrosse team.

154
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:39,078
Phew! I just had me one of them
pees that's better than sex.

155
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,248
You know, a pee-gasm.

156
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:46,085
You know, it's possible
you're not having sex right.

157
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,713
Well, it's also possible
you're not peeing right.

158
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:54,343
- Hey, Ma, could you grab me a beer?
- Sure, darlin'.

159
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,221
Hank, I'll give you five bucks
for that beer.

160
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,266
Done.

161
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,518
Cheers, Maggie.

162
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,771
Come on. Let's grab a table.

163
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:08,066
Oh, yeah, good, just the two of us.

164
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:11,069
Sit and talk for a while.

165
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:13,737
Would you like a beer?

166
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:16,324
Ma, I got a tryout tomorrow.
Make it a whiskey.

167
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,868
- You look good, Ma.
- I'm all right.

168
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:23,706
I got my health,
the bar keeps me pretty busy

169
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:27,376
and it's filled with a bunch of drunk guys
I can take advantage of if I want to.

170
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,420
You can start with me.

171
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:33,882
I said, "If I want to," Hank.

172
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:37,845
- How's it going with your dad?
- Hmm.

173
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:40,389
Remember how he reacted
when Obama got elected?

174
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:42,975
It was worse than that.

175
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,020
Stupid question.

176
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,274
What the fuck's on your feet?

177
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:56,114
Tom Brady wears 'em.

178
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:59,075
Looks like Marcia Brady wears 'em.

179
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,122
All right, give this to your brother.

180
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,874
And don't touch any of the waitresses.

181
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:08,959
Hey, Alicia came on to me.

182
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,919
She saved a horse and rode a cowboy.

183
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,135
Aren't you Colt Bennett?

184
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:18,969
- Do you work here?
- No.

185
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,388
Then yes, I am.

186
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:21,930
[chuckles]

187
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,601
[both breathing heavily]

188
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:28,146
[exhales] I can't believe
I'm in Colt Bennett's bedroom.

189
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:30,063
I can't believe I'm here, either.

190
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:31,815
[chuckles]

191
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,317
How old were you in that picture?

192
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,444
Uh, that was high school.

193
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:36,737
So, uh, 17?

194
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,114
You were really hot.

195
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:39,240
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

196
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:40,949
- Duh.
- [chuckles]

197
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,911
Is that your national championship ring?

198
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:45,704
Yep. Florida State. '99.

199
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,956
Wow. 1999.

200
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,792
I was six. [chuckles]

201
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,460
Oh, '99...

202
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:55,005
So that'd make you born in '93.

203
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:58,091
Carry the one.
And that would make you 24?

204
00:10:58,176 --> 00:10:59,968
- I'm 22.
- [scoffs] Even better.

205
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,179
[chuckles]

206
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:05,098
I'm about to have sex with
a national championship quarterback.

207
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:07,935
Uh, the backup to the backup quarterback.

208
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,771
You know, now seems like
a bad time to be honest.

209
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,524
Wait. Backup?
But you were the best ever.

210
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,734
Yeah, the coach had it out
for me from day one.

211
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,862
- Why?
- 'Cause I didn't show up till day three.

212
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:22,366
And I slept with his daughter
on day four. But...

213
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,577
- [knock on door]
- [Beau] Colt.

214
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,370
She's 22!

215
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,290
Hi, Mr. Bennett.

216
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,876
Dad, this is Heather.

217
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,421
I know Heather.
How's your mom?

218
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,048
She's good. She says, "Hey."

219
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,967
She's a fine woman.

220
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,427
Top-notch bowler.

221
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,679
Put your clothes on, I need a hand.

222
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,055
Wha... seriously?

223
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:48,058
One of the cow's water just broke
and she's calling your name.

224
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,560
Let's go. Heather...

225
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:51,979
good seeing you.

226
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,064
Tell your mom Beau says "Hey" back.

227
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,858
[Heather chuckles]

228
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:58,277
[grunts] Sorry.

229
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,865
Oh, actually, those are my Uggs.

230
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:09,121
- How's she doin'?
- It's a breech.

231
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:10,373
Oh, damn it.

232
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:12,207
All right, Colt.
Get over here and wash your arm.

233
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,292
What?

234
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:15,544
[stammers] Why do I got to
put my arm in her?

235
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:16,670
Why can't Rooster do it?

236
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,256
Because he's not good at it.

237
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,048
[sighs] Of course I'm good at it.

238
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,551
Last time, you lost your watch in there.

239
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,012
Who cares? It's waterproof.

240
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,599
- Come on, Colt. Hustle it up.
- I'm coming.

241
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,435
God, wait, why can't you hook her up
and I'll just pull the rope?

242
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,731
You know, that's the beauty of having
somebody beggin' for a place to stay.

243
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,358
You can't ask 'em to pay rent,

244
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:40,110
but you can ask 'em to stick
their arm up a cow's address.

245
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,194
So, come on.

246
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:44,072
[Colt] All right, Carla.

247
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:47,159
- [Carla mooing]
- Here we go, girl. You're gonna be fine.

248
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:49,703
You don't have to make love to her,

249
00:12:49,787 --> 00:12:53,206
just get the calf out of there
so we can raise it and slaughter it.

250
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,543
[grunting] Ew! Forgot how warm it is.

251
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,587
- All right, I got her legs.
- [Beau] Good.

252
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,298
Feet will be right at the end of those.

253
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,633
Thank you, I know what I'm doing.

254
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,343
God, do I look like an idiot?

255
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:08,347
Well, you're shoulder-deep in a cow
and ankle-deep in her shit, so...

256
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:11,099
Man, my Uggs.

257
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:14,728
Hey, if you feel a Timex up in there,
grab it for me, huh?

258
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,982
You know what? You can't see it,
but I'm flippin' you the bird right now.

259
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:21,610
All right, one loop for each foot.

260
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:22,861
- Come on.
- Yeah, I got it!

261
00:13:22,945 --> 00:13:25,280
Oh, you got it?
Well then start pulling!

262
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,366
You know, did it ever occur to you

263
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,869
to encourage me instead of
riding me all the time?

264
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:33,706
If I rode you, it was 'cause you were
the only one in this family

265
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,791
that had any smarts or talent.

266
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:37,418
Standing right here, Dad.

267
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,379
I'm aware of that, Jameson.

268
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:41,755
[Carla mooing]

269
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,050
We all sacrificed
so you had a chance to succeed.

270
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,969
But you weren't willing to work for it.

271
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:48,136
So, here we are!

272
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,598
You know, where do you get off
being so high and mighty

273
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,600
when you can barely pay
the bills around here?

274
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:54,477
Who told you that?

275
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,606
I'm allowed to say things.
I'm a person.

276
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,150
I'm gonna go hang out with Heather.

277
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,657
So, is it true?
You in trouble?

278
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,577
It's not my fault.
It's that other bastard.

279
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,871
- What other bastard?
- God.

280
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:17,249
There hasn't been a decent rain
around here in over a year.

281
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:20,293
It's hard to raise grass-fed cattle
when there's no grass.

282
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:22,921
[stammers] That ain't God, Dad,
that's global warming.

283
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:25,924
Global warming's a bunch of crap
Al Gore made up

284
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,260
to sell books to Californians.

285
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,971
Besides, what do you care?

286
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,307
You haven't been around this family
the last 15 years.

287
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:36,935
Yeah. Why do you think I left, Dad?
Because of you.

288
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,604
Well, why are you here now?

289
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:39,897
Oh, that's right,

290
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,440
you got no place else to go!

291
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:42,650
Go to hell!

292
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,113
Ah, it ain't breathing.

293
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,658
Hell, I'll get the epinephrine.

294
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,075
I'll give her CPR.

295
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,077
That's not gonna work.

296
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:55,954
Damn, this is the last thing I need.

297
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,039
[blowing]

298
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:58,707
You're wasting your time.

299
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,250
[calf mooing]

300
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,504
[grunts]

301
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,757
Wasting my time.

302
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,801
Well, it worked. He's up.

303
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,469
I'll be damned.

304
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,222
Come here, buddy.

305
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:25,943
Rooster, we are the proud parents
of a beautiful 85-pound boy.

306
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,988
It was incredible.
That calf was born still.

307
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:33,116
I gave it CPR
and I brought it back to life.

308
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,869
[chuckles] Wow, Colt.

309
00:15:35,953 --> 00:15:38,288
You had your arm up a cow
and made out with a calf.

310
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:43,251
You know, you diddle a chicken,
you're in the farmer's Hall of Fame.

311
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:48,090
I'm gonna go back out and check on him,
make sure that calf is sucking.

312
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:49,174
Colt...

313
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:51,719
good job.

314
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,309
- Did he just...
- Yeah. He just said, "Good job."

315
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,354
And then I think he felt nauseous
and went outside to get some air.

316
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:08,444
I think the last time
he told me "good job"

317
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,446
was when I learned how to walk.

318
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,115
I think his exact words were...

319
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:14,533
"Jesus, finally."

320
00:16:17,536 --> 00:16:19,622
You know what you should do
to really mess with him?

321
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:22,249
Go outside, look him straight in the eye,
and say...

322
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,627
"I love you, big fella."

323
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:29,214
Yeah, then you can go tell him
you're a Democrat. [chuckles]

324
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:30,716
[both laughing]

325
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:32,926
Oh, God.

326
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,803
I don't think washing helped at all.

327
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:36,805
Yeah, that smell never really goes away.

328
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,348
You know, my advice is

329
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,143
when it comes to putting
body parts into livestock,

330
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:42,686
you always wanna use the same arm.

331
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,982
This one... is for pregnant cows
and constipated horses.

332
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:49,735
This one for eatin',
whistlin' and shakin' hands.

333
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:51,904
Unless I don't like the guy,
and then I use this one.

334
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,450
Yeah, that was not the vagina
I thought I'd be in tonight.

335
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,579
You know, all in all, it was a good day.

336
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:04,291
Even prison's fun
when you're just visitin'.

337
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:05,918
You get to talk on that phone.

338
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,671
Lady next to you puts
her boobies up against the glass.

339
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:10,213
[Colt chuckles]

340
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,716
If it's so bad here,
why don't you just leave?

341
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,553
You're kidding, right?

342
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,181
After you left,
that wasn't much of an option.

343
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,391
Dad needed someone here
to help him run the ranch.

344
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,602
So you felt like you were stuck?

345
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:27,230
Well, you must think I'm...

346
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:30,358
Spoiled? Selfish? Irresponsible?
Kind of a wuss?

347
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:34,446
Okay. I was gonna say "selfish" but...

348
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,032
Conceited? Stubborn?
Full-blown alcoholic?

349
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,702
But... [sighs]

350
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:42,621
you were a hell of a football player.
And you had to go.

351
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,415
I was proud of you.

352
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,042
You're my little brother, <i>amigo</i>.

353
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,170
Thank you.

354
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,090
You know, I'm proud of you, too.

355
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,383
[scoffs softly]
Yeah? For what?

356
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:04,517
You know, I really didn't think there was
gonna be a follow-up question.

357
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:07,354
All right. Well, I'm gonna go outside
and help Dad with Carla.

358
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:08,731
Unless, of course, you want to?

359
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:09,857
Oh, no. You do it.

360
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,150
I can't make eye contact
with her for a while.

361
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,410
Mom?

362
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:23,996
Oh, hey, Colt.

363
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,709
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

364
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,002
What are you doing here?

365
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:31,879
Your father.

366
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:35,132
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

367
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:38,218
You and Dad still...

368
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:40,345
Every time I see your father, we fight.

369
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:42,180
And every time we fight, we end up f...

370
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:43,641
All right! All right!

371
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:45,851
I got it.

372
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:49,605
Oh, if it helps,
we weren't facing each other.

373
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:56,319
No, that does not help at all!

374
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:00,323
- Do you want some coffee?
- Sure.

375
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,952
Oh, man. [sniffs] Whoa!

376
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:06,329
What are you doing?

377
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:10,042
Oh, Carla had a breech birth last night.
So I had to stick my arm up her...

378
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,919
Got it.

379
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:14,421
If it helps, we weren't facing each other.

380
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,592
That's cute.

381
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,511
Soap and water won't do it.

382
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,973
Need some Tabasco, tomato juice,
a stalk of celery and vodka.

383
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:26,725
That's a bloody Mary.

384
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:29,812
Right, you have four of those,
you won't care how your arm smells.

385
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,193
You ready for your tryout?

386
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:39,697
[inhales deeply] Yeah, I think so.
I'm a little nervous.

387
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,658
Well, that's good, right?
It means you still care.

388
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,913
How about I make you that pre-game pasta
you used to like?

389
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:50,874
[chuckles] Thanks, Mom,
I'm not a kid anymore.

390
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,169
How about a pancake
with a whipped-cream face?

391
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,214
Oh, yes, please. [chuckles]

392
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:05,681
Blue skies.
God, I never thought I'd hate blue skies.

393
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:09,059
You know, I don't think
it's rained here since you left.

394
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,270
Yeah. Dad told me it's been
kinda rough around here.

395
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:15,440
"Kinda"?
You up to speed on everything here?

396
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,777
- Well, obviously not.
- [sighs]

397
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,823
This is the worst year
that anybody can remember.

398
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:26,159
I mean... [sighs]
he even had to let Pedro go.

399
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:30,413
Wait. So, it's just him and Rooster?

400
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:33,291
Oh... wait.
He's not gonna lose this place, is he?

401
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,417
I mean, that'll kill him.

402
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,129
No. Keeping this place is killin' him.

403
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:41,008
He's been out there for hours already.
He hardly ever sleeps.

404
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:43,802
[sighs]

405
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:45,971
Sorry...

406
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,598
can't put the face on the pancake.

407
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,226
Your father and I used
all the whipped cream up last night.

408
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:52,685
[Colt sighs]

409
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,358
[shudders]

410
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:08,243
- Looked good out there, Bennett.
- Oh, hey, thanks.

411
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:11,454
Yeah. Just taking it one play at a time.

412
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,040
Figure if I give it 110%...

413
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:14,875
Cut the crap.
This isn't a press conference.

414
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,460
How's the shoulder?

415
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,254
Yeah, it's a little sore.

416
00:21:19,337 --> 00:21:23,175
Nothing three Vicodin and a couple of
shots of whiskey can't take care of, huh?

417
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:24,301
Funny.

418
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,178
Yes, that was a joke.

419
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,891
[sighs] Think you can make it
through a whole season?

420
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,601
I can if it means
you got a spot for me.

421
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,062
You're Colt Bennett.

422
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,646
In these parts, you're still a big deal.

423
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,606
Nothing else, you'll sell tickets.

424
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,653
And by that, I mean every player has to
sell at least ten tickets per home game.

425
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:45,781
What's the starting salary?

426
00:21:45,864 --> 00:21:48,909
Two hundred and fifty a game.
You start, it's a bonus of 50.

427
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:51,119
If we win, you get another 50.

428
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:53,914
Are you kidding? I got paid
more than that for playing in college.

429
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:55,582
[chuckles] Another good one.

430
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:57,835
Yes, that was also a joke.

431
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,298
Look, I know it's not the big time,
but the quality of play is pretty decent.

432
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:06,134
And occasionally NFL scouts
do come to these games.

433
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:07,469
It's a long shot...

434
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:08,595
Yeah, no, I get it.

435
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:11,348
You can't win the lotto
if you don't buy a ticket, right?

436
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,682
That's the attitude.

437
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,227
First practice, Wednesday at 11:00.

438
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:19,064
Extra 15 bucks if you come early
and line the field.

439
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:21,774
[chuckles] Oh, thanks.

440
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,819
Can't wait!

441
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:25,653
[grunts softly]

442
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:28,823
[sniffs] Oh, damn, Carla.

443
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:40,293
Yeah, it needs a new head gasket.
All right, I'll order one online.

444
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,545
No. We'll go over
to Henderson's to get one.

445
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,714
If they don't have it,
we'll go someplace else.

446
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:48,218
No, Amazon will have it here in 24 hours.

447
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,888
See? That's what's wrong
with your generation.

448
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:53,765
Oh, good.
I was wondering what's wrong with us.

449
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,809
You're a bunch of lazy bastards.

450
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:58,353
You never wanna leave the house.

451
00:22:58,436 --> 00:23:01,982
What're you gonna do when North Korea
comes knocking on the door?

452
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:03,901
You gonna order a gun on Amazon?

453
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:07,195
No, I'm gonna go to
the gun rack in the truck...

454
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,282
or the gun rack next to the fridge,
or the gun rack in the bathroom,

455
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:12,867
or the second gun rack in the bathroom.

456
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:16,579
- Hey.
- [Rooster] Hey, how'd it go?

457
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:17,998
Yeah, it could've gone better.

458
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:19,791
What do you mean
"It could've gone better"?

459
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:20,959
[drops bag]

460
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,920
I mean I didn't make it.

461
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:25,923
Damn, Colt. I'm sorry.

462
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:27,966
You know what you could do?

463
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,468
Strap on those Uggs
and try out for cheerleader.

464
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:32,804
Screw you.

465
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:34,056
[chuckles]

466
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:35,182
So...

467
00:23:35,265 --> 00:23:37,684
anyway, I don't know what
my next step's gonna be but...

468
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:41,854
I thought, if it's all right with you,
I could stick around here for a while.

469
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:43,982
You're serious?

470
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:46,026
Yeah.

471
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,280
Guess you were right.
I'm done with football.

472
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:53,700
Wow, I didn't realize
I'd raised a quitter.

473
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:56,369
Really?

474
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,622
You've been telling me
to give it up for years.

475
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:02,250
You've got no sense of humor at all.

476
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,338
Look, for what it's worth...

477
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:09,299
I'd be happy having you around here

478
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,052
and I'd rather not see you
cripple yourself.

479
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,056
Wait. You just said something nice to him.

480
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:18,808
And yesterday you said "good job."

481
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:21,144
Are you dying?

482
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:22,562
[chuckles]

483
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:25,148
One more thing.

484
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:27,150
Here.

485
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:33,615
Where'd you get this?

486
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:36,201
Sold my championship ring.

487
00:24:36,284 --> 00:24:38,411
Figure all the money you gave me
over the years,

488
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:39,621
it's the least I could do.

489
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:43,750
No, thanks.

490
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:48,546
Uh, Dad, we could use that money.

491
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,173
Yeah, I want you to have it.

492
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,634
Do I look like some kind of charity case?

493
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:54,427
Oh, come on.
I'm just trying to help.

494
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:57,555
We've got a country full of
people with their hand out.

495
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:02,727
All I want is what I earn.
All anybody is gonna do for me is dig...

496
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,439
[all] ...a six-foot hole in the ground
and drop me in it.

497
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:10,027
Well, it ain't gonna be here
'cause you're about to lose this place.

498
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,986
This place isn't yours to save.

499
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,658
[stutters] Just swallow your pride
and take the damn money!

500
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:18,410
Not gonna happen.

501
00:25:18,493 --> 00:25:21,996
God, you are such a stubborn
old son of a bitch!

502
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,710
Listen, son...
I'm not too old to kick your ass.

503
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:32,090
It's like my birthday all over again.

504
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:36,386
You don't wanna start this with me, Dad.

505
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,721
I didn't start this. You did.

506
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,265
- Don't touch me.
- All right, relax, guys.

507
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:42,184
No. I started this?
I started this?

508
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:44,394
You drove me out of here!

509
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,104
And then you drove Mom out of here!

510
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:48,856
Hell, I left the gate open, even the cows
tried to get away from you!

511
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,858
You're standing awful tall
for a man who came

512
00:25:50,942 --> 00:25:52,735
- crawling back on his hands and knees!
- Hey. Hey!

513
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:53,861
- You...
- Hey!

514
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:55,613
[both shout] What?

515
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:58,158
It's rainin'.

516
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,336
Screw you, Al Gore!

517
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:16,259
[thunder cracking]

518
00:26:38,072 --> 00:26:39,741
Couldn't have just told Dad
you wanted to stay?

519
00:26:40,658 --> 00:26:41,659
What are you talking about?

520
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:43,453
I know you made that team.

521
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,579
Uh, no I didn't.

522
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:47,249
When you got cut
from that team in Alaska...

523
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:48,708
you punched out the mascot.

524
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,752
Well, that mouthy penguin
had it coming.

525
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,214
He kept telling the coach
I was drunk at practice.

526
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:55,340
Were you?

527
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:59,677
That's not the point.
The mascot's job is to support the team.

528
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:02,639
[chuckles] You have the worst temper.

529
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,391
If you didn't just make that team,

530
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:06,351
there is no way you'd be
this calm right now.

531
00:27:08,186 --> 00:27:09,479
All right, don't tell Dad.

532
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:12,399
If it doesn't make you look like an ass,
it's none of his business.

533
00:27:12,482 --> 00:27:13,816
[chuckles]

534
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,033
Isn't this fantastic?

535
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:25,870
Well, it's a start.

536
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:28,039
Everything's getting a drink...

537
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,333
including me.

538
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:34,712
You know,
if someone took a picture of us...

539
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:37,424
they'd never know
how fucked up we really were.

540
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:38,800
[all chuckle]

541
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,260
Well, to the Bennetts.

542
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:41,636
The Bennetts.

543
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:45,682
You know, I just wanna point out...

544
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,935
that the rain did not arrive until I did.

545
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:52,772
So... so, maybe I'm the good luck charm
this family needs.

546
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:54,899
- [lightning crackling]
- [chuckles]

547
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,486
Hell. The barn's on fire.

548
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,917
[bluegrass music playing]

549
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,919
