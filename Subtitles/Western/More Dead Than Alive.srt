1
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,760
Do everything
just like I told you, old man,

2
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,763
and you'll live to make some more
of these bone boxes.

3
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,114
Open the gates!

4
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,142
Hey, Jonas!

5
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,009
Hope you made 'em extra long.

6
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,379
We got a couple of big ones.

7
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,274
Bring 'em out.

8
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,640
Keep cool, old man.

9
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,977
Graber, look at that.

10
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,220
Ned Cawley, Frank Graber...

11
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,562
Joe Maxwell, Jesse Barton.

12
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,467
You've been found guilty of murder
in the first degree...

13
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,172
...by the people
of the territory of Arizona

14
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,708
and on this thirteenth day
of January

15
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,267
in the year of Our Lord 1891...

16
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,944
I am hereby ordered
by this warrant to have you...

17
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,679
hanged until dead.

18
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,047
You boys wanna make a...

19
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,680
You boys wanna make a statement?

20
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,157
Hurry it up, fat boy.

21
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,887
We have a date in hell for dinner.

22
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,223
Shut up.

23
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,196
Why don't you go...

24
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,732
Hang the warden,
hang the warden,

25
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,003
hang the warden,

26
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,306
hang the warden...

27
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,755
Shut up!

28
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,193
Shut up in there!

29
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,777
Quiet! Cut it out!
Shut up in there!

30
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,392
This one's holding on.

31
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,428
Can't last much longer, though.

32
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,338
You're gonna see a lot of men
hang before you get out of here, Wes.

33
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,737
Oh, yeah?

34
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,275
You've been good to me
in this hole, Cain, and I like you.

35
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,972
But let me tell you this.

36
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,846
I ain't gonna sit in here
for 18 years and rot like you did.

37
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,210
No pen can hold
Luke Santee's brother.

38
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,047
You'll see.

39
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,757
It's all done.

40
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,429
Bring out the wagon.

41
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,179
Swing the wagon over
to the gallows.

42
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,549
I'm gonna fill these things up.

43
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,787
They're already filled!

44
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,189
Come on, Luke, over here!

45
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,068
Luke, Luke,
come on down this way.

46
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,135
Here I am!

47
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,876
- Hurry up!
- Damn it! Come on down here, Luke!

48
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,748
You've each got six shells apiece, boys.
Make 'em count!

49
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,946
Come on, Luke!

50
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,387
Boy, am I glad to see you, Luke!

51
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,085
Go for the gate!

52
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,859
Go for the gate!

53
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,297
Gimme the gun!

54
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,766
Go for the gate!

55
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,853
Come on, Cain.
We can use a man like you.

56
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,489
Don't do it, kid, even if you make it
out of here, they'll get you.

57
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,554
Wes!

58
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,956
Hank, get over here!

59
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,353
Cain...

60
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,695
you bastard!

61
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,860
You dirty bastard!

62
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,139
Cain's a rehabilitated man.

63
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,580
Well, that's a credit to you
and your institution, Warden.

64
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,447
Oh, no, it's a credit to Cain.

65
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,146
And that's why the court saw fit
to release him.

66
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,745
Cain will never
pick up a gun again.

67
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,587
The hell he won't!
He'll have to.

68
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:59,195
Cain spent half his life right there
in the cell where loud mouth is standing.

69
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,699
Cain was a tough kid
when he came here in '73.

70
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,325
Now he's a mellowed man

71
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,565
with dreams
of making an honest life for himself.

72
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,539
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

73
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,735
Why don't you try Las Rinas?
It's the nearest town.

74
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,466
Hey, look out!

75
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,219
Bobby?

76
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,614
Bobby, bring those crates
right over here.

77
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,758
- Can I help you?
- No.

78
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,396
Hey, whatcha doin', mister?

79
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,692
I'm just looking, son.

80
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,164
Never seen you around here before.

81
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,795
You just passing through?

82
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,440
I don't know.

83
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,735
Are you a cowboy?

84
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:54,968
No.

85
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,481
- A miner?
- Nope.

86
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,419
It's Ruffalo!

87
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,130
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

88
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,504
Step right up.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

89
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:27,409
See the spectacular shootin' show
and death display.

90
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,472
See the world's greatest gunslinger.

91
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,246
His firearm's first fiddle, folks.

92
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,915
He's a sharp one, folks.
He's a shootin' shark!

93
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,894
And see the world-famous collection
of macabre curios inside.

94
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,089
The little lump of lead
that was removed

95
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,928
from Jesse James' back.

96
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,164
And the number noose
that nicked Nick Norris's nasty nape!

97
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,764
It's the biggest little show
in the territory.

98
00:17:55,841 --> 00:18:00,107
And no lesser person than the great
Mr. Twain himself said, "It's the best!"

99
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,477
All right, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

100
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,108
Now here's your change, sir.
Thank you very much.

101
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,950
All right, thank you, go right in.
There's plenty of room for everybody.

102
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:13,355
Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the
best shows you've ever seen in your life.

103
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,017
There you go, two of you.
Enjoy yourself.

104
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,997
Thank you very much.
Don't miss the shootin', kid.

105
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,158
Don't miss the death display!

106
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,299
Betcha never thought
you'd see that again, did you, Cain?

107
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,609
No, I...

108
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,812
I never did.

109
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,715
I won it in a poker game.

110
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,020
I heard you were gettin' out and...

111
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,649
Well, I hoped
that our paths might cross.

112
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,159
I figured you might be lookin' for a job.

113
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,024
Well, I am, mister, but...

114
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,860
Not Mr. Butt, Mr. Ruffalo.

115
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,832
Dan Ruffalo.

116
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:34,968
Listen, Cain,
I have a proposition for you.

117
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,077
If your proposition involves this,
I ain't interested.

118
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,807
Oh, now, don't be so hasty, man.

119
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,907
I think you might like
what I have to say. Sit down.

120
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,520
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

121
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:57,457
I know how tough it is
for guys like you to find a job.

122
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:02,566
It's a shame folks feel the way they do
about people who've served a little time,

123
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,603
but, well, it's a fact.

124
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,469
And I might help you.

125
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,030
What do you mean?

126
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,975
Well, I've got a pretty good
little business drummed up

127
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,275
in this here territory.

128
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,508
You can hear that.

129
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,211
Billy and me,
we make pretty good money.

130
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,981
And the work ain't hard and...

131
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:29,221
Well, I kinda figured you might have
a hankering to... join up with us.

132
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,694
What do you need me for?

133
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,526
Well, you know, I kinda figured
that folks might enjoy seeing Killer...

134
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,432
There, you see?

135
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,341
I almost said Killer Cain,
well, damn it all, I did say it.

136
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,140
Killer Cain.

137
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:53,375
I think people might really have
something to talk about if they could...

138
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,754
Well, if they could see you...

139
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,787
...using this notched Colt of yours.

140
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,592
Yeah, I see what you mean, but...

141
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,963
No, thanks.

142
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,601
I know you mean well,
but I just ain't interested.

143
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,228
There's good money in it.

144
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,967
I just don't want to be
around guns, mister.

145
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,635
I think you can understand why.

146
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:25,807
Well, what do you figure
on doing then?

147
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,283
Oh, I don't know, I...

148
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,881
I'll find work.

149
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:35,154
Cain, listen to me.

150
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,819
The West is...

151
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,696
a lot different than it was back in '73,
when you were part of it.

152
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,598
A whole lot different.

153
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,934
The railroad and the telegraph,
they've changed everything...

154
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,529
or almost everything.

155
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,304
The only fact that you can be sure of
is that you're Cain.

156
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,340
A man to be feared.

157
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,712
Certainly not trusted.

158
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,542
No, it's gonna be real rough for you
to find a job.

159
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,451
It is for all ex-cons.

160
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,591
Well, maybe you've noticed
that men don't wear guns anymore,

161
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,651
unless they're on the road.

162
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,596
No, things have
settled down out here.

163
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,066
And that makes for a lot of...
Easterners coming out west.

164
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,330
And there ain't
enough jobs for them.

165
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,099
Let alone, you.

166
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,769
I hope you're wrong, mister.

167
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,640
I ain't.

168
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,078
They didn't like me,
they love me.

169
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,910
Billy.

170
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,475
This here is Killer Cain.

171
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,951
This is...

172
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,721
This is the man, right here?

173
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,989
The genuine article.

174
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,128
Thanks for the drink, Ruffalo.

175
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,693
I guess I better get going
and find some work.

176
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,205
Sorry we couldn't make a deal.

177
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,539
Say, I'm sure glad to have met you.

178
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,402
All right, men, form a group.

179
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,133
Right around here.

180
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,380
I need four men only.
Big and strong.

181
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,318
You, there.

182
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,416
You.

183
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,562
You.

184
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,061
You there with no hat on.

185
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,361
I'm sorry, Cain, it's...
it's company policy.

186
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,034
Let's go, men.

187
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,152
Hey, mister.

188
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,753
I see you're looking for work.

189
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,157
- I sure am.
- See that wagon?

190
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,955
Two bucks if you drive it
to Cragston's mine.

191
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,966
Put the stuff inside, and I'll give you
another two bucks when you get back.

192
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,071
You know where it's that?

193
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,033
You just point me
in the right direction.

194
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,351
Morning!

195
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,188
I wanna be able to do this again.

196
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,627
You're gonna have it
a lot rougher out

197
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:19,931
than you did in.

198
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,818
Hello!

199
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,320
Anybody here?

200
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,557
I just needed a little water. I...

201
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,497
I didn't mean any harm.

202
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,735
I hollered but nobody answered.

203
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,345
I...

204
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,383
I guess I don't look too good.

205
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,217
I had a little accident.

206
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,626
May I?

207
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,808
There's some rags
in back there, too.

208
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,281
My name's Cain.

209
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,181
Just Cain.

210
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,516
Justin Cain?

211
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,553
No, ma'am.

212
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,023
Just...

213
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,889
Only Cain.

214
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,494
What happened to you?

215
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,896
Well...

216
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,068
I guess you could say I got fired.

217
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,764
You're going back to... Las Rinas?

218
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,037
Dry Wood.

219
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,839
I came out here this morning.

220
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,574
Be going back
as soon as I finish my painting.

221
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,309
They say this town was abandoned

222
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,908
when the stage line
stopped making its run.

223
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,482
Guess you know all about that.

224
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,316
That does it for today.

225
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,987
- That sure is good.
- Thank you.

226
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,063
I was wondering, miss, if I...

227
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,533
could ride in with you?
To Dry Wood?

228
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,902
We'll make a deal.

229
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:17,408
You help me get my supplies in the
buckboard, I'll get you into Dry Wood.

230
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,737
Yes, ma'am.

231
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,869
By the way,
my name is Monica Alton.

232
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,841
Things have changed around here,
haven't they?

233
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,747
Yes, ma'am, they sure have.

234
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,147
That's why I'm out here.

235
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,715
I'm doing a series.

236
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,316
Not just sketches,
but paintings, as well.

237
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,885
I hope to capture pictorially
what Bret Harte and Mark Twain

238
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,022
were able to put into words.

239
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,363
"Local color,"
if you know what I mean.

240
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,766
No, ma'am,
I can't says I do.

241
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,101
There's no reason why you should.

242
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,103
Well, you've got local color,
you belong out here.

243
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,512
You have a very interesting face.

244
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,606
I'd like to paint it some time.

245
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,781
Who are you?

246
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,877
I told you, my name's Cain.

247
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,612
I mean, what do you do?

248
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,392
I didn't mean to pry.
It's really none of my business.

249
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,327
I don't blame you for wondering.

250
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,965
Why don't we...

251
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,969
get moving and we can talk about it
on the way to dinner.

252
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,538
- Is that an invitation?
- Yes, ma'am. I've got two...

253
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,339
What's the matter?

254
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,074
Well, I had two dollars.

255
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,445
I guess I not only got fired,
I got robbed.

256
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,278
I went to Vassar.

257
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,050
That's a school back east for women.

258
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,952
I detested it.

259
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,254
So of course I didn't do very well
in my studies.

260
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,460
I flunked out.

261
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,025
But I didn't care, anyway.

262
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,931
'Cause all I wanted to do
was come out west and paint.

263
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,504
My father thought
I was running away from failure.

264
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,631
He tried to encourage me by saying

265
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,701
that it wasn't what happened
in the past that mattered,

266
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,211
it was the future.

267
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,378
You're trying to encourage me by...

268
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,317
telling me that I should forget my past.

269
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,581
Well, I'd like to, but...

270
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,351
it seems like most people
remember too hard.

271
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,187
Why do you help them?

272
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,751
I don't understand.

273
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,690
Why did you tell me your name?

274
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,196
Why didn't you say it was Crane,
or something else?

275
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,795
It isn't what people think you are
that matters. It's what you are.

276
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,566
Would you promise
an intuitive woman something?

277
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,338
I'll make a deal with you.

278
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,645
If you say yes,
I'll treat you to that dinner.

279
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,046
- You sure like to make deals.
- Well?

280
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,015
Well, it sounds
mighty tempting, but...

281
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,854
You can pay me back later.

282
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,054
Say it's a deal.

283
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,563
All right. It's a deal.

284
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,157
Why don't you get out of here?

285
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,368
Why hang around small towns
where people will remember?

286
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,239
Go east or north
to a city like Prescott.

287
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,699
- That's Killer Cain.
- I know.

288
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,964
I I heard he was here in Dry Wood
a couple months back.

289
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,198
This winter.

290
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,104
Do you... happen to know
where he went?

291
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,301
No.

292
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,338
It's getting dark in here.

293
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,277
I never saw Cain.

294
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,680
I bought that sketch off of Joe Kirby
over at the boarding house.

295
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,982
Some girl left it behind
when she decided to move on.

296
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,630
Round and round she goes,
and where she stops nobody knows.

297
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,502
Two to one, gentlemen.
Here you are.

298
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:16,971
Thank you.

299
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,441
Sorry, place your bets now.

300
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,119
Place your bets.
Last chance.

301
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,589
- Night, Justin.
- Good night, Bruce.

302
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,875
All right, folks.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

303
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:54,475
Step right up and see
the spectacular shooting show

304
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,213
and death display.

305
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,983
See the world's
greatest gunslinger.

306
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,353
He's sharp.
He's a shootin' shark.

307
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,523
So step right up and get
your tickets here, ladies and gentlemen.

308
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,758
Justin.

309
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,373
He sure is loud.

310
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,208
There's a kid in there
that's pretty good with a gun.

311
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,768
You've seen the show?

312
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,974
A couple of months ago
in Las Rinas.

313
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,813
...show, and the death display,
ladies and gentlemen.

314
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,419
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

315
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,362
Yes, sir,
you can place your bets.

316
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,767
Place your bets.

317
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:22,203
Round and round she goes
and where she stops nobody knows.

318
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:25,003
Everybody down.
Place your bets.

319
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,475
She's stopping.

320
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,409
Two to one!

321
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,605
Here you are,
here you are, thank you.

322
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,512
Thank you, young lady.

323
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,247
Everybody down.

324
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,889
Place your bets, all right?

325
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,431
You know what I want, Jim.

326
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,934
Right away, Sheree.

327
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,916
- Could I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

328
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,353
How's that thing work?
I don't know much about that.

329
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,890
It's simple.

330
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,588
Why don't you come over when
I'm on the wheel and I'll show you.

331
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,993
Oh, I...

332
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,157
That would be fine.
I sure would like you to do that.

333
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,065
Anytime.

334
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,533
Say, aren't you that kid
from the shooting show?

335
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,564
I'm the star.

336
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,970
Well, I didn't see the show,
but I sure heard it.

337
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,240
You did?

338
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,547
Say, honey,
you sure do make a lot of noise.

339
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,364
Fix me a drink.

340
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,171
Sorry, son.

341
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,106
I got a tough boss.

342
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,168
All I can serve you is a sarsaparilla.

343
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,510
- A... a what?
- Sarsaparilla.

344
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,782
You kidding me?

345
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,015
There's nothing I can do,
they made it a law.

346
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,016
I see, they made it a law.

347
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:24,528
Well, look, I'm not interested
in a civics lesson, mister.

348
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,190
I'd just appreciate
if you'd just fix me a drink, there.

349
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,630
Can't you read?

350
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,993
Let's see.
"No minor persons served."

351
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,670
Now, I can read that sign,
but I don't believe it.

352
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,871
I would appreciate it if you would
not worry so much about my schooling

353
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:45,177
and tell your hands to do their stuff
or I'll blow 'em off your wrists!

354
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,583
You got any ideas about using
that gun in here, son, forget it.

355
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,512
Cain!

356
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,824
"Cain"?
What are you talking about, kid?

357
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,553
That man's name is Justin.

358
00:39:56,627 --> 00:40:00,085
I don't know about that.
That... that's Cain. That is Mr. Cain.

359
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,688
"Killer Cain."

360
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,669
l... I was just playing,
just messing around, you know.

361
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,227
I sure wouldn't mess with you.

362
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,933
I sure wouldn't mess
with Killer Cain, would you?

363
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,770
<i>That's Killer Cain.</i>

364
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,037
<i>That's Killer Cain.</i>

365
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,747
Cain? Or is it Justin?

366
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,890
I witnessed you at work tonight.

367
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,395
I told you it would be tough
finding a job.

368
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,632
Like you said,
you witnessed me at work. I got a job.

369
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,034
But how long did it take?

370
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,172
You know, I've been in a lot of those...

371
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,146
those towns where you've been
in the past few months.

372
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:55,151
And I... well, I know
how hard it's been for you.

373
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,017
I ain't complaining.

374
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:02,357
No, you didn't complain
when you were slopping pigs in Bisbee

375
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,395
or cleaning spittoons in Tulsa.

376
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,953
Oh, let's face it, man,

377
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,295
you weren't even able
to hold those jobs,

378
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,561
and you won't be able
to hold this one, either.

379
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:16,334
I told you once before.
I ain't interested in your proposition.

380
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:19,766
All right.

381
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:24,941
I just wanted to let you know
the offer still stands, if and when.

382
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,250
Billy and me'll be pulling out of here
in the morning, for Redrock.

383
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,089
In case you change your mind.

384
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:41,855
And I was so cock-sure
that I could get Cain to join up with us.

385
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,736
I thought he'd be tired
of those chicken feed jobs by now.

386
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,466
Listen, we are doing all right, Rufe.

387
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,701
Good as folks say he was...

388
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,766
How much better
could he be than me?

389
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,789
If only you hadn't lied to him
in the first place.

390
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,858
Why didn't you just tell him
who you were?

391
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,794
You know,
he probably wouldn't have cared

392
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,128
if you had leveled with him
right from the beginning.

393
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,828
And why did you say
your name was Justin?

394
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,971
It's a long story, Sheree...

395
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,236
Good-bye and thanks again.

396
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,643
For what?

397
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,745
For trying.

398
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,812
Good-bye.

399
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,256
Well, it looks like
everything's in place.

400
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,092
- Your offer still stand?
- Sure!

401
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,865
We were just about to pull out.

402
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,138
Billy, lock up that wagon.

403
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,842
You come with me, Cain.

404
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,903
All right, Billy, let's get rolling.

405
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,745
I gotta stop over at my place
and get my gear.

406
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,268
Eighteen years in prison made me
think I'd never touch another gun.

407
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,108
That gun's gonna earn you
a lot of money, Cain.

408
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,272
Good money.

409
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,511
Yeah, yeah, it sure will.

410
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,485
I bet you're pretty...
pretty good with that.

411
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,757
What I love are those 12 notches.

412
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,896
- Those were the good old days.
- How would you know?

413
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,329
I've heard.

414
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,594
I've heard how every man
would wear a gun

415
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,001
and if he wanted to have it out
with a guy, why, he did.

416
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,100
Today you're lucky
if you can get a guy outside to fist-fight.

417
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,508
Here, load up.

418
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,910
I'll...

419
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,476
see if I can trim
that branch back a little.

420
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,188
Looks like I need some practice.

421
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,037
I never miss.

422
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,943
Well, Cain,
you just got yourself a free show.

423
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,255
Now, I know what you're doing there,
you're holding back, aren't you?

424
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,588
- No.
- Yes, you are.

425
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,255
I know you killed 12 men. I know
you must have been sharper than that.

426
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,798
I was.

427
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,596
How'd you do it?
How'd you kill 'em, I mean?

428
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,260
Different men, different ways.

429
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,931
"Different men, different ways"?

430
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,907
But you always let 'em
draw first, right?

431
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,273
No.

432
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,869
Not if there was a chance
I might get beat.

433
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,779
The only code I had
was to let 'em know I was coming.

434
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,275
But you never
bushwhacked anyone, did you?

435
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:32,345
Well, like I said, they knew
I was coming, so they all had guns

436
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,083
and none of them got it in the back.

437
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,083
Well, see, I thought...

438
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,493
You thought that
I marched down the street,

439
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,895
called 'em out
and waited for 'em to draw?

440
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,896
No, Billy, I...

441
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:48,502
I was hired to use my gun and I did.

442
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,905
Well, l...

443
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,871
I'd let anyone draw first.

444
00:46:57,748 --> 00:47:00,376
'Cause I can outdraw anyone.

445
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:05,711
It's... it's hard for me to believe
that you never were as good as I am.

446
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,121
Good at what,
Billy, hitting branches?

447
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,654
Or killing men?
There is a difference.

448
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,925
Eighteen years ago
a man never holstered an unloaded gun.

449
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,524
You're just playing games, kid.

450
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,933
Let me ask you something.

451
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,669
How old were you
when you killed your first man?

452
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:30,269
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.

453
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,805
What was he?
A sheriff or a marshal or what?

454
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,114
- Soldier.
- Soldier?

455
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,152
How much you get paid?

456
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,889
I didn't get paid anything.
It happened in a fist-fight.

457
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,188
Oh, well.

458
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,594
No, I mean, what about when
you had that first notch on your Colt?

459
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,756
What about it?

460
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,834
I didn't get paid anything
for that, either.

461
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:55,997
I killed a bounty hunter
who was after my hide.

462
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,736
Well, the first time
you got paid, how much?

463
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,541
- $50.
- $50!

464
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,014
$50.

465
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,081
Fifty bucks
don't mean much to him, Cain.

466
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,553
He's spoiled.

467
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,115
He don't know what it was like
out here in those days.

468
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,318
Well, it was different.

469
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,720
A lot different.

470
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,601
My father was a sergeant
in the Fourth Cavalry,

471
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,763
and they were always out
chasing Indians.

472
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,740
I never saw much of anything
except the inside of army forts

473
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,298
till I killed that soldier.

474
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:38,108
All my life I'd seen men die.

475
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:42,015
The ones that lived brag about
killing others, so life was cheap to me.

476
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:46,222
And $50 was a lot of money.

477
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,586
Especially when you were on the run.

478
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,527
Yeah, you make it sound lousy.

479
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,154
It was.

480
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:59,426
Hell, I just wish... I just wish
I'd been living in those days.

481
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,336
'Cause the way
I handle a gun, boy, I'll tell ya.

482
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,897
The way you handle a gun,
you'd been a dead man.

483
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,806
Somebody would have
shot you in the back

484
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,038
because they were afraid
to face up to you.

485
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,774
That's the way it was,
and don't you think different.

486
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,115
Mr. Cain.

487
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:30,399
How come...
no one went for your back?

488
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,094
It's a big enough target.

489
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,095
Well, a fella did once,
but his aim was low.

490
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,437
I got a scar on my ass to prove it.

491
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,478
Here, try that on, for a start.

492
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,683
Go on, man, put it on.
Put it on.

493
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,561
Yeah, it looks good.
It looks good.

494
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,795
Everything's gonna be black.
Black Stetson, black bandana.

495
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:10,863
Everything black but the silver.
Here, a black jacket, black jacket,

496
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,239
black pants...

497
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,641
Look at this.

498
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:19,538
Look at that <i>buscadero</i> belt.
Ain't that snazzy, huh?

499
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,712
It's just what a killer's supposed
to wear, ain't it, Cain?

500
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:27,689
I guess so, but... I sure never
wore nothing like that.

501
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,090
Well, think maybe we better try
some of this on, huh?

502
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,787
We might have to make
some alterations.

503
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,821
You're a big son of a bitch.
Look, here's some black boots.

504
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,202
Killer Cain. Killer Cain.

505
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,799
We stay here for a couple of days,
and then we'll hit Tempe,

506
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,845
and Phoenix, and Higginsville
and Liberty, and...

507
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:52,245
by the end of the month
we'll be in Valseco.

508
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,824
Mornin', Linus.
Seen The <i>Epitaph?</i>

509
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,525
Well, something in here I think,
uh, will interest you.

510
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,236
Says Cain's coming back to town.

511
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,275
According to the article, Cain's been
with Dan Ruffalo's shootin' show

512
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,775
for almost a month.

513
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:24,211
He'll be here today or tomorrow.

514
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,427
<i>Ha kee.</i>

515
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,580
I thought we made a deal.

516
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,178
Hi.

517
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,956
I want you to know I tried.

518
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,617
I believe you.

519
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:13,459
Oh, I'm not kiddin' myself.
I know it's not the best life, but...

520
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,862
it's better than anything
I've ever known.

521
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,594
Then I'm happy for you.

522
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,928
I better go finish my sketch.
It was nice seeing you again.

523
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,267
Wait a minute.

524
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,533
I owe you these.

525
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,446
I had a feeling I'd get these back.

526
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,475
Be seein' ya.

527
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,016
Be seeing you.

528
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:59,440
All right, folks, step right up.
It's the biggest little show in the territory.

529
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:04,071
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Thank you, sir.
I hope you enjoy yourself.

530
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:07,844
Step inside, folks, and see
the spectacular shootin' show,

531
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,785
starring the infamous Killer Cain.

532
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:14,255
Step right inside,
ladies and gentlemen, if you dare,

533
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:18,590
and let the Killer show you
the 12 notches on his Colt

534
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,391
and how they got there.

535
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,989
All right, folks, step right up.

536
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,466
Come on, folks,
you got a treat inside. Let... what...

537
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,695
What the hell are you doin'?

538
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,601
All this shouting
about "The Killer," "The Killer".

539
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,072
Now, look...
Listen to me.

540
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,769
- Billy, calm yourself.
- Now, you should listen to me.

541
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:36,506
You said that I was the star.
I was the star!

542
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,572
Billy, this is my show,
and I'll bark what I damn well please.

543
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,380
Now you get your butt back in there
and do what I pay you to do.

544
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:43,612
Go on, git, git!

545
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:47,350
All right, folks, I know you don't wanna
miss this spectacular event.

546
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,689
Here's your change, sir,
thank you very much and...

547
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,921
Carson?

548
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,758
I'm glad to see you!
You come to see the Killer?

549
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:03,004
You know, I think you and I
might work something out.

550
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,597
What are you getting at?

551
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:08,543
Well, seein' as how you and Cain
have met before and right out here,

552
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:13,777
I think folks might, uh, well,
they might enjoy seeing a little... encore.

553
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,511
I'll make it worth your while.

554
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,952
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

555
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,222
step right up, let me see
the color of your money.

556
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,220
Mr. Cain,
would you take a challenge?

557
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,283
Three shots apiece for a dollar?

558
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,819
Sure.

559
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,848
It looked easy.

560
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,963
Well, thanks anyway.

561
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,940
It sure would have been great
if I could have said I'd beat you.

562
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:53,447
I'm the best shot in town, Cain.
You wanna take me on for a dollar?

563
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,748
Well, I guess we can't see
the Killer back down.

564
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,717
There you go.

565
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,379
Son of a bee!

566
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,617
Cain...

567
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,124
best of six...

568
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:40,060
on the wheel.

569
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,924
Three out of six.

570
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,254
Six out of six.
Can't beat that.

571
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,570
Mr. Cain, what'll you have?

572
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,946
Well, I'll try some of that rye.

573
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:08,314
All right.

574
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,994
Say, here, it's the next one,
right here, that's on me.

575
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:24,398
And, uh... you can pour me...
pour me the same.

576
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,935
At least I don't see any signs around
that says I can't, do you?

577
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,336
Thanks.

578
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,443
Listen, I was... was going
to ask you something...

579
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,504
Oh, yeah. What do you...
what do you think about Rufe?

580
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,606
He's a good man.

581
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:44,381
Yeah, well, that's...
That's what I thought at first, too.

582
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:49,357
I really did.
But l... I don't think so now.

583
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:53,658
When I first met him, he was...
he was moving about the territory,

584
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:58,394
doin' nothing, I mean, he was selling guns,
but folks weren't buying 'em.

585
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,096
Course, then one day he sees me.

586
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:02,502
And I'm...

587
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:06,064
you know, shooting bottles off the fence,
you know how I shoot.

588
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:09,475
Well, he gets the idea
of trying to drum up a little business

589
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,743
with me showing off his hardware,
so I said, "All right," I said,

590
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:16,411
"I'll go with you, I'll go along with you."
And one thing led to another.

591
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,750
After a couple of months,
he stopped selling guns

592
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:21,814
and began selling admissions
to see me shoot.

593
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,052
It seems to me,
he's been pretty good to you.

594
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,290
Hell, but not good enough,
not good enough, shoot!

595
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:29,628
He treats you a helluva lot better
than he does me!

596
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,633
And I've known him
a lot longer than you,

597
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:34,363
and I'm a helluva lot better
with a gun than you.

598
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:38,601
See, what I don't figure
is how he could bark to townsfolk

599
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:43,510
that I am a shootin' shark,
but forget himself

600
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,743
that I could blow him apart
if I got the urge.

601
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,284
See, people ought to realize that
the same thing I do to those targets

602
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:54,482
I could... I could do to them.

603
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:58,186
You're talking awful big, Billy.
Draw against me.

604
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,054
What?

605
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,620
You heard me.
Draw your gun.

606
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,593
You see, when you are a little bit afraid
and not quite sure of yourself,

607
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,730
even the fastest gun can be beat.

608
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,972
Things are different
when the target can shoot back.

609
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:17,946
You remember that.

610
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,845
You're still playing.

611
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:23,147
Yeah, well, you just stand up
and try that again.

612
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,051
I couldn't do that, Billy.

613
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,420
You're dead.

614
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,247
Well...

615
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,651
I've waited a long time, Cain.

616
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,383
Carson.

617
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,557
I was wondering when I drove in here
this morning if you might still be around.

618
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,119
Get up.

619
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,424
No.

620
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,561
Why don't you sit down?

621
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,629
I'm calling you outside, Cain.

622
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,470
Go on, Cain!

623
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,034
Last time I stepped outside
with a lawman,

624
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:25,274
it cost me 18 years of my life.

625
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,111
I can't afford any more time.

626
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,983
You forget I'm not
a lawman any more.

627
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,783
And I'm not a gunfighter.

628
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:34,619
You owed your life.

629
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,751
A court settled for 18 years, Carson.

630
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:42,662
Eighteen years don't pay
for all them murders.

631
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,666
So maybe you paid for one,

632
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,965
but you got a dozen notches
on your Colt.

633
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,498
I'm a free man, Carson.

634
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:57,846
I don't want any trouble from you
or any other man.

635
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:11,719
I would've paid you for that performance
this afternoon, Carson.

636
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:15,525
You just didn't have what it takes
20 years ago.

637
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:21,730
Twenty years ago, Cain was young
and fast, like the kid here.

638
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:24,705
But now he's older and slower,

639
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,799
like I was when he called me.

640
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,106
When he called you?

641
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:34,014
He didn't call you, Carson,
and you didn't go out willingly.

642
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,278
You were forced into that shootout.

643
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:37,683
Forced? I was the Marshall!

644
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,552
The way I heard it,
the people of this town forced you.

645
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:41,954
You're a liar, Ruffalo.

646
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:44,516
Oh? Somebody stop me
if I'm wrong.

647
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,222
- Now, there's no need to...
- No one forced me!

648
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:50,562
The thought that Cain was here
in Valseco back in '71

649
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,396
sent a chill through this town.

650
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:53,799
I knew he was here to kill.

651
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:56,304
- Yes, but nobody knew who.
- I was the Marshall!

652
01:02:56,372 --> 01:03:00,103
So they shoved you out of that door
to stop Cain before they could find out.

653
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,337
- I did my duty!
- And he winged you.

654
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:05,245
Because of that,
your marshalin' days were over.

655
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:06,475
No one forced me!

656
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,178
Now you know that Cain
could have killed you that day.

657
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:13,654
Lucky for you that he just went
for your shoulder.

658
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:18,057
Now, you listen to me, man.
Forget about that revenge, hear?

659
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,617
I'll buy you a drink.

660
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,863
Come on,
I'll buy everybody a drink.

661
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,162
Say, Rufe,
who did he come gunnin' for?

662
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,964
Oh, some cattleman.

663
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,061
Yeah, yeah, but did he get him?

664
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,538
Does an outhouse stink?

665
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:34,702
Well, he sure ain't
the same man, I tell you.

666
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:38,736
I was kinda hopin' to see he
and that old buzzard get into something.

667
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:43,047
Oh, that'd been great.
Either way, we would have lost Cain.

668
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:07,107
Cain?

669
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,144
Makes you feel
like a big man, huh?

670
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,251
Travelin' around the territory.

671
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:26,428
Showing everybody
your 12 notches.

672
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,157
I'm not proud of what I was.

673
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,668
Huh? Why else you doin' it?

674
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,102
'Cause it's the only tool I know.

675
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:39,608
I'm not hurting anybody, and I'm
earning an honest living for myself.

676
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:44,113
Ain't no way for you to be honest, Cain.
No way at all.

677
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:51,577
I haven't got a gun...

678
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,315
or a mind to draw against you.

679
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,847
Cain... here you go!

680
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:03,923
Well, now, that solves
half your problems, don't it?

681
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,264
That's right.
Go ahead, shoot him.

682
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:08,236
Stick it in your belt, that'll do.

683
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:11,705
Just stick it in there
and just... blow his head off.

684
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:14,038
Ruffalo claims
that I was forced last time.

685
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,635
Well, this time I'm forcing you.

686
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,305
Go ahead, blow it.

687
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,741
- Damn you! Pick up that gun!
- He means it, I tell you.

688
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,015
He almost blew my toe off.
Now pick up the gun.

689
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:29,024
- Just go ahead and blow his head off.
- Stay out of this, Billy.

690
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:34,921
Well...

691
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:40,024
Well, if he... if he won't pick up
the gun, just shoot him.

692
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,365
Go ahead and shoot him.

693
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,667
Pick it up, you hear me?!

694
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,576
Now, I tell you, if I were you...
if you look at his eyes now...

695
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:53,843
I would just take hold of this little thing
right here and blow his head off!

696
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:03,923
Listen, if I were you,
I would just right now

697
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:07,224
blow one bullet,
right in him, right here.

698
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:10,288
Right here. Just blow his head off.

699
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,596
Now you want to, don't you?
Don't you want to?

700
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:13,726
Shut up, you!

701
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,273
He's getting away.
You kill him now.

702
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:24,108
Now, damn it,
you go shoot him in that back!

703
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:33,014
Why did you let him get away?
I want you to tell me that.

704
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,887
But... no, no, I know.
l... I know.

705
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:39,291
I know you were just...
you're just waiting for him to turn around

706
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,330
so you can shoot him
in the back, weren't you?

707
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:46,532
See? You don't know that I know
that's the way they do!

708
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:51,835
They... they wait, and then,
ah, they... turn around

709
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:55,708
and they shoot them in the back!
That's what they do.

710
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,770
My God...

711
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:03,016
That's... I know,
that's what you waitin' for.

712
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:11,956
If he... if he would have just...
got this gun!

713
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,758
Damn near as crazy as you are.

714
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:21,566
You... you just seek him, you know,
you just pick it up and go pow!

715
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:08,143
Cain?

716
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,187
It is Cain.

717
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,657
You livin' around here?

718
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,058
I have my own place now.

719
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,961
- Still painting?
- Still painting.

720
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:25,194
You still look hungry and beat,
just like the first time I saw you.

721
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,566
What happened
with the shooting show?

722
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:28,968
Oh, I left.

723
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,199
Are you sure
you weren't fired again?

724
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:35,335
I need help
unloading my buckboard.

725
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,606
It's filled with a month's supply
of shopping.

726
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,672
Your services for all you can eat?

727
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:41,978
Is it a deal?

728
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,882
It's a deal.

729
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,825
If you'll unload the stuff,
I'll get supper ready.

730
01:09:56,726 --> 01:09:59,991
I haven't eaten that good
in a long time. Thanks.

731
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,586
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

732
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:38,627
Your face is so difficult to draw!
It's so complicated!

733
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:43,336
Like my life.
And yours.

734
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,498
Why mine?

735
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:50,335
Well, it seems to me this is a hard life
for a lady like you.

736
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,615
Must be a reason you live like this.

737
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:57,050
- Like what?
- Alone.

738
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,587
The only reason is
because I like it this way.

739
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,648
Heaven knows I don't have to.

740
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:07,560
Don't you miss
those big cities back east?

741
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:11,157
No. I was born out here.

742
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:17,905
My father came out here in '49,
first gold rush.

743
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:21,136
Took him ten years,
he finally struck it rich.

744
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:26,808
So did my father.
Came looking for gold, I mean.

745
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,281
What happened?

746
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,751
The only gold he got
was three chevrons on his sleeve.

747
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:37,486
- I mean, what happened to you.
- Me?

748
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:43,664
I was raised around army forts.
The only time I saw my father

749
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,497
was in between details,
and usually he was just soberin' up

750
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,400
when it was time to leave again.

751
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,131
And then one day
he didn't come back.

752
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:57,678
The Major said he died,
but I think he deserted.

753
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,374
What about your mother?

754
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,777
I never saw her, that I remember.

755
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,209
How different...

756
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:11,156
My father sold his mine interests,
packed up my mother and me,

757
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:15,129
and took us back east,
where we lived in complete comfort.

758
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,098
Imagine what
it would have been like

759
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,601
if your father had struck it rich
and mine hadn't.

760
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,731
I can't.

761
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,971
Well, l... I guess
I'd better be going.

762
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:46,317
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome any time, Cain.

763
01:14:25,361 --> 01:14:26,692
What are you doing?

764
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,488
Morning.
Hold that end up, will you?

765
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,366
I thought you left last night.

766
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:37,803
Well, I started to,
but you filled me up so good

767
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:40,740
that I didn't much feel
like making the ride back to Las Rinas.

768
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,800
You're lettin' it drag.
Raise it higher.

769
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:50,179
You know, this place could be fixed up.

770
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,311
The land around here
could support stock.

771
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:56,818
There you are.

772
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,496
I was thinking last night...
or maybe I was dreaming, but...

773
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,794
I know I could do something
with this place.

774
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,268
That would mean a lot to you,
wouldn't it, Cain?

775
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,330
I'd pay you rent as soon as I could.

776
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:15,173
That wouldn't be good business
on my part.

777
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,575
You'd have to pay me first.

778
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:21,443
- You know I can't do that.
- Oh, yes you can.

779
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:29,250
Would you please hold still?

780
01:15:30,426 --> 01:15:33,156
I'm sorry, Cain, but it just isn't right.

781
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:37,558
Damn it, Monica, I'm not posing anymore.
There's work to be done.

782
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,533
If you don't pose, you can clear out.

783
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:51,669
For Heaven's sake, of course!

784
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:58,010
- Look, I think I'd better do the shaving.
- No, this is fun!

785
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,136
Mr. Ruffalo.

786
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,541
Mr. Ruffalo!

787
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,266
- Mr. Ruffalo!
- Yeah?

788
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,632
- I'm looking for Cain.
- So am I.

789
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,804
He up and left me
a couple of months back.

790
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,711
Would you have any idea
where he might have gone?

791
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,044
Who's askin'?

792
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,946
An attorney, huh?

793
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:11,254
Well, it's like I told you,
I'm looking for him, too.

794
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,157
I think you've made
a little mistake here.

795
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:20,900
Clay Allison died
under the wheels of a wagon.

796
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:23,995
- He was drunk.
- You don't say.

797
01:17:32,448 --> 01:17:36,043
You're an attorney?
Who's got himself hung recently?

798
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,961
Need anything from town?

799
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,006
No. Is that where you're going?

800
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,668
I gotta pick up some nails and a flint.

801
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,007
Say, those flowers are looking great.

802
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,138
Everything around here does.

803
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,482
When will you be back?

804
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,543
I'll be back in time for dinner.

805
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,304
I've been working out there
for over a month.

806
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:15,350
All I can say is I'm sorry,
but we require some collateral.

807
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,679
But it's fertile land!

808
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,344
With a small amount of livestock,

809
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,911
I know I could make it
a good ranch in no time.

810
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,617
I'm sure you could,
but we can't loan you the money.

811
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,523
Because I'm Cain.

812
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:30,358
To be frank, you'd be a poor risk.
But that's not the main reason.

813
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,457
We ask collateral of everyone.

814
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,525
If Miss Alton would put up her deed
on the property,

815
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,935
we'd be glad to make the loan
for livestock.

816
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,997
No, sir, she's got nothing
to do with this.

817
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,337
It's her land.

818
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,776
But it's me that's gonna
make something out of it.

819
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,644
Tell me something, Cain, what
have you done since you got released?

820
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,742
Possibly I can find
some related work for you.

821
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,411
Well, I've had a lot of odd jobs,

822
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:56,514
but only two things that lasted
for any length of time.

823
01:19:56,592 --> 01:20:00,084
I was a bouncer,
and I did some shooting on a show.

824
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,062
With Ruffalo, of course.

825
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,495
You know Ruffalo?

826
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:06,261
We loaned him the money
to buy that circus wagon of his.

827
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:08,565
Do you happen to know
where he is now?

828
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,663
As a matter of fact,
I ran into him last week in Prescott.

829
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:14,694
Well, kid, he's back with us,
starting tomorrow.

830
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,965
- He is, is he?
- Yeah.

831
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,974
Say, listen, uh,
what'd he have to say?

832
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:23,808
I mean... did he... did he go into, uh,
any reasons why he left...

833
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:27,144
No. No, I didn't ask.

834
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:30,013
All that matters is that he's back.

835
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:34,419
And we're gonna start
taking in that big money again.

836
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,563
Where's the big box
we put the spent shells in?

837
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,628
It's behind the barrel.

838
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:00,571
Cain?
What'd you come back for?

839
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:01,980
For money.

840
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:06,511
Wait.

841
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,685
Did you...

842
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,693
...say anything to Ruffalo
about what happened?

843
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,257
No, I didn't.
And I don't intend to.

844
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:24,302
You know,
I wanna tell you something.

845
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:30,437
I can't see how both you and me
can be in this show.

846
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:36,044
I was hoping old man Carson
would fix things once and for all,

847
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,609
but he didn't, so I guess
I'll have to call you myself.

848
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,745
Now go get your gun.

849
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,655
What's the matter, old man?
I'm calling you! Go get your gun.

850
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:48,719
It's back there on the wagon.
Now go get it!

851
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,958
Go on, old man, go get your gun.

852
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,636
Put that thing away, Billy.

853
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:04,372
Well, okay, I will put it away.

854
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:07,381
I will put it away.
It is put away.

855
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:10,544
'Cause I'm just playing.

856
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:14,077
Hey, you aren't afraid of a kid
who's just playing, are you?

857
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:17,757
You know, you're right,
it doesn't have to be right now.

858
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:19,924
But it's gonna be.

859
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:27,992
"Killer."
"Killer Cain."

860
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,906
What'd you do?
You shoot them all on the back?

861
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,830
You're breaking my hand!

862
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,293
You're breaking my hand!

863
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:02,996
That's right, boy.
I could break your hand right now.

864
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:05,733
And then where would you be, huh?

865
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,435
Don't you ever try me again.
I've had it with you.

866
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:11,843
I'll quit this show
when I'm damn good and ready.

867
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:16,850
And the next time you talk to me,
you say "Mr. Cain." Understand?

868
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:53,244
Why didn't you tell me
you were leaving?

869
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:57,848
I didn't plan to.
It just worked out that way.

870
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:02,421
When you didn't come back,
I went in to Las Rinas and asked around.

871
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:05,466
Bill Grayley at the bank said
he thought you might be here.

872
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,225
You don't have to do this,
you know?

873
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,036
It's the only way I know
to earn money.

874
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,336
I'll stake you.

875
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:18,038
No. I couldn't do that.

876
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:27,310
One wouldn't know it,
looking at you in that getup.

877
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:30,419
You're a very proud man.

878
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:33,658
I love you.

879
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,286
You know that.

880
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:40,261
And I love you, too.

881
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:43,270
But please try to understand
why I have to do this.

882
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,330
It's not the best way for a man
to make a living, but it's honest.

883
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:49,536
I just want to make enough money
to buy some livestock,

884
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:51,101
and then we'll be married.

885
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:02,880
Who ever would have thought
back in Boston...

886
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:08,293
...l'd be saying "yes"
in a cheap hotel room in Arizona...

887
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,193
...to a tall gunslinger in black.

888
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:26,647
Listen, that's the southbound.
I'll make you a deal.

889
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,783
You catch it, go back to Las Rinas,

890
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:32,217
and I'll come back to you
as soon as I can.

891
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:35,414
It's a deal.

892
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:42,661
Keep your hands off of that.
That's Cain's share!

893
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:46,132
That's Cain's share, yeah.

894
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,897
And which one is mine?
Don't tell me!

895
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:51,131
The little one is mine.

896
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,935
Yes, that's yours.

897
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:55,568
- Big one is yours.
- That's right.

898
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:59,546
This is my show, Billy,
and I pay a man exactly what he's worth...

899
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:01,104
no more, no less.

900
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:05,809
It may be your show,
but I am the star, and you know it.

901
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:09,880
You was, Billy, you was,
until Cain come along.

902
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:12,017
Twice as many people
are paying to see him.

903
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:13,355
He's earned his share.

904
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:15,225
He's earned his share.

905
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,787
I wanna tell you something.
You know why he came back?

906
01:27:17,866 --> 01:27:19,356
He's in here for just one big one.

907
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,959
Then you know what that scarred-assed
son of a bitch is gonna do?

908
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:23,698
He's gonna take a walk!

909
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:27,264
No, he ain't gonna walk away
from all that money, Billy.

910
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:30,573
The only one who's gonna walk
is gonna be you,

911
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:33,341
if you don't like the way
I'm running things.

912
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:38,581
Hell, I can find me half a dozen
sharp shootin' youngsters.

913
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:42,054
But I'm never gonna be able
to find me another Cain.

914
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:45,115
Hell, you know
there's no one better than me.

915
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:48,060
Maybe not, Billy, maybe not.
But you ain't a killer.

916
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:51,189
How many times
do I gotta tell you, kid?

917
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,822
People want to see a killer.

918
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:55,392
They pay to see Cain
because he's a killer.

919
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,301
Now you...

920
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:59,533
you ain't nothin'.

921
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,837
Just a little pissant.

922
01:28:07,816 --> 01:28:10,546
So that's what I gotta be, huh?

923
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,284
A killer!

924
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:17,483
All right, Rufe, I'll be a killer.

925
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:23,289
If that's what I gotta be, I'll be one.

926
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:26,093
Killer.

927
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:54,622
Oh, God...

928
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,592
I am a killer, Rufe.

929
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,678
Ruffalo?

930
01:29:51,519 --> 01:29:53,510
I come for my money.

931
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:14,233
All that yours?

932
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:18,699
Yeah, it sure is.

933
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:27,211
That's a lot of money
for a kid like you.

934
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:29,311
I could sure use it.

935
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:36,679
You know, I don't think
that you know who I am.

936
01:31:36,758 --> 01:31:37,918
Nope.

937
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,425
Billy Valen.

938
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:44,561
I'm Little Boy Blue.

939
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:48,696
I like that! I really do.

940
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:51,568
I really like that.
You're a very funny man.

941
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,438
Now, Mr. Funnyman...

942
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,902
Have you heard of, uh...

943
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:02,605
...Dan Ruffalo's Shooting Show?

944
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,882
I...

945
01:32:11,059 --> 01:32:13,755
...just happen to be the star.

946
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:17,290
That's right, I'm the star.

947
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:24,330
Now you say
that you can use that, huh?

948
01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:26,498
Is that right?

949
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:30,442
There it is.

950
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:35,845
Now, if you think
that you can take it, why...

951
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:39,811
...take it.

952
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:57,166
Have you ever seen anything that fast?

953
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,322
Didn't anyone ever tell you, boy?

954
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:29,158
Never holster an empty gun.

955
01:33:39,147 --> 01:33:43,140
You're not... you're not
gonna shoot me, are you?

956
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,913
You bet your ass I'm gonna.

957
01:33:55,663 --> 01:34:01,124
l... I don't wanna die, mister...

958
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:15,008
He-help me! Help me...

959
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:06,576
Now laugh.

960
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,921
Go on, laugh.

961
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,221
Like you did in the mine, uh?

962
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:29,599
Everything around here
looks real nice.

963
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,668
Your husband's done a great job.

964
01:37:31,746 --> 01:37:34,146
Thank you, Mr. Grayley.
We're very happy.

965
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:35,705
I'm sure you are.

966
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:38,251
You know, folks up north
sort of consider him as a hero

967
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:40,549
for bringing in Luke Santee
like he did.

968
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:42,555
It's ironic, isn't it?

969
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:45,615
Well, looks like you have company.
I'll be going.

970
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,024
Thank you for dropping by.

971
01:37:47,094 --> 01:37:48,755
- Bye now.
- Bye.

972
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:19,825
Is your husband around, ma'am?

973
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,623
Why, yes, he's in the back.

974
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:24,522
Here he comes now.

975
01:38:37,144 --> 01:38:39,135
Hi, there.
What can I do for you?

976
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:41,374
It's what I can do for you.

977
01:38:41,449 --> 01:38:43,883
I've been looking for you
for quite some time.

978
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:56,656
Why?!

979
01:38:56,731 --> 01:38:57,755
- Why, why?!
- Why?

980
01:38:57,832 --> 01:39:00,323
All right, I'll tell you why.

981
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,893
Because 20 years ago,
Cain killed my father.

982
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:06,531
He served 18 years in prison.

983
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,269
No, that was the price of one life.

984
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,675
Cain took 12.

985
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:18,882
Oh, no!
