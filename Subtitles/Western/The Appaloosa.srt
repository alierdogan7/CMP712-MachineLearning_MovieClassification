I'm--I'm havin' a little trouble
gettin' started, Father.

13

You are in the house
of God now, my son.

Speak from your heart.

00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,888
Well, uh...

16
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,827
I've done a lot of killin'.

I've killed a lot of men
and sinned with a lot of women.

18
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,297
But the men l--I killed
needed killin'

19
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,568
and the women wanted sinnin',

20
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,509
and--and I never was
one much to argue.

21
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,048
Most of the men I killed
was in the war.

22
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,853
So I suppose that makes it all right,
don't it, Father?

23
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,756

All right.

27
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,894
I'm home here now

If he is, you will know him.

my woman wished
to be married in this church.

you violated her here.

the wrong man, mister.

your woman. I never...

but one hour in this town.

74
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,453
I never violated no woman.

75
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,493
No, seòor, if you had,

76
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,460
He would have killed you.

77
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,432
Does you try,
I will kill you.

78
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,677
Are you talkin' about that woman
that was just in here?

79
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,179
I never touched her. If she told you
that's what I did,

80
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,045
then she's lyin'.
Because that's not true.

to ride it

how are the women.

She could not decide
which one to choose,

112
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,772
but now that she has ridden it,
it pleases her very much.

113
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,751
I will buy it for her.

114
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,883
No, you won't. This horse
ain't for sale.

than I offered for it before.

as an insult.

00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,625
[chuckling]

369
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,461
[kissing]

370
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,063
Go and get the old man's jacket,
will you?

371
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:46,964
I wanna try it on.

372
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,213
(Ana)
Mateo, do not go.

373
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,821
(Matt) Ana, excuse me,
sweetheart.

374
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,537
[sniffs]

375
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,543
(Ana)
Do not go.

376
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,514
I'll be back in a few days.

377
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,843
No, you will not be back
in a few days,

378
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,355
or a few weeks,
or a few months.

379
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,490
We will be lightin' candles
for the dead.

380
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,859
If we're gonna have a ranch,
we gotta have a horse around here.

381
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,831
A ranch. W-what do we need
with a ranch?

382
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,430
It's only more work.

383
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,302
Yeah, that's not
what you were sayin' yesterday.

384
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,839
We want you, Mateo.

385
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,375
You're more important to us
than any ranch.

386
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:03,209
Oh, Ana, I'll be back here with that 
horse before you can turn around.

387
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,910
It'll be as easy
as cuttin' butter.

388
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,810
It is your throat
that will be cut, Mateo.

389
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,086
You do not know
about Chuy Medina.

390
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,623
Well, the man stole my horse.

391
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,955
What the hell am I supposed to do?
Go over there and, uh,

392
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,393
and sit down in the river
and forget about it?

393
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,760
[clanking]

394
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,230
Horse.

395
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,026
Horse. I am tired
of hearin' about that horse.

396
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,560
You drifter.

397
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,497
You come in here
worryin' about a horse.

398
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:33,133
What do you think
will happen to my family?

399
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,511
All right, go to Méjico.
Go get it.

400
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,309
He will cut you up
in little pieces,

401
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,148
and we will bury you
and plant more corn.

402
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,916
You just
don't understand.

403
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,594
It's not about a man
stealin' my horse, Ana.

404
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,264
[sighing]

405
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,605
It's about somethin'
that happened

406
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,711
a long time ago,
before you was even born.

407
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,816
It started when Paco's dad
picked me up when I was a scared,

408
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,144
dirty, skinny, little runt,

409
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,790
and brought me home here,
to live.

410
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,955
Scrubbed me up and treated me
like I was his own blood.

411
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,322
And he never
gave up on me, Ana.

412
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,928
Not--not even when I stole.

413
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,137
Not even when I lied
or when I cheated him.

414
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,667
I've seen him sweat
like an ox

415
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,976
in the corn field all so as he can 
get some grub on the table for us.

416
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,248
No matter
how hard he worked,

417
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,486
no matter how worn out
he was after workin',

418
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,821
he used to come here
and sit in this chair

419
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,922
and play the guitar
and sing us a song,

420
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,355
teach us a little bit
how to read,

421
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,457
best he knew how, anyway.

422
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,297
About that time,
I left here with that old

423
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,600
one-eyed mule and $1.86
in my pocket.

424
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,971
And that was all the grubstake
he had to give me.

425
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,173
And I had big ideas

426
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,308
about what I was goin' to do,

427
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,351
how I was going to
get myself a hat full of gold,

428
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,288
come back here
with a real pretty lady,

429
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:35,425
and build us a big old hacienda out 
there by the pig house

430
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,235
so as the old man
wouldn't have to work no more.

431
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,735
I thought, maybe with a good stallion,
we can build us

432
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,799
a little horse ranch
and give it to the kids.

433
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,839
That old man spent a whole lot of years
tryin' to make...

434
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,679
[sighing]

435
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,044
a decent man out of me,

436
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,821
and gettin' that horse was about 
the only way I can see

437
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,654
to payin' him back.

438
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,858
I never realized

439
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,725
that his arms
were so short.

440
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,697
[horse neighing]

441
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,939
Well, here comes Paco.

442
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,195
(Ana) Paco, Paco,
reason with him.

443
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:51,870
Tell him not to go.

444
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,235
There is nothin' I can do.

445
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,798
Okay, kid,

446
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,740
where are we goin'
and how do we get there?

447
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,137
Once you go
across the river into Méjico,

448
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,043
you take the main carretera
to Cocatlan.

449
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,875
Always keep goin'
in the southwest.

450
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,977
It's one, two days' ride.

451
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:39,519
Remember,

452
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,659
Chuy is not just one man,
Chuy is an army.

453
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,356
Please,

454
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,794
don't trust anyone.

455
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,376
Mateo,

456
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,783
you may get cold.

457
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,059
Hope not.

458
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,682
[goats bleating]

459
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,681
[donkey braying]

460
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,383
[bell continues tolling]

461
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,490
[people chattering]

462
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,574
[coins clinking]

463
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,478
[speaking Spanish]

464
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,276
Flaco.

465
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,000
@Pulque?

466
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,505
(Matt)
Sí.

467
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,630
Permit me, seòor,
to buy you a pulque.

468
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,132
(Matt)
With pleasure, amigo.

469
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,607
Is this your first visit
to this pulquería?

470
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,873
Yes.

471
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,046
It's a nice
little place, though.

472
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:37,382
They got a few flies in the pulque,
but not too many.

473
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,721
[both chuckling]

474
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,783
Do you know, seòor,

475
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,995
where the custom
comes from,

476
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,397
to drink the first litro
without stopping?

477
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,301
No, I don't know
how that started.

478
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,202
I was just wondering.

479
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,506
I do not know, either.

480
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,510
For you.

481
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,012
No, gracias.

482
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,740
You don't have a light
for my cigarro?

483
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,579
[speaking Spanish]

484
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,890
[inhaling deeply]

485
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,761
Gracias.

486
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,626
Where you go, seòor?

487
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,563
Do you have business
somewhere in Sonora?

488
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:32,634
No, I'm going to Batopilas.

489
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,643
Batopilas?

490
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,701
Sí.

491
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,707
That is a long
ways from here.

492
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,509
Do you know this town?

493
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,709
Sure.

494
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,485
I want to ask you a question.

495
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,684
Does, uh, Catamaria still have
her little cantina there?

496
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,690
Catamaria?

497
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,021
It's just one
room and she has, uh,

498
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,790
only two tables
and she cooks on the floor,

499
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,999
but her chicken mole,

500
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,470
ay yi yi,
compadre, it is the best.

501
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,127
[chuckles]

502
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,475
There is a girl there now,

503
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,876
I wonder if you know her.

504
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,542
What is her name? Uh...

505
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,352
She has red hair
and almost white eyes.

506
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,324
I have-- I have not been
there for a long time.

507
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,822
But I don't remember any girl
with red hair and white eyes.

508
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,084
Hmm.

509
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,787
[chuckles]

510
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,567
I'm going to tell
you something, seòor.

511
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:38,074
I don't think that you know
too much about Batopilas.

512
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:41,566
Hmm.

513
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,135
[chuckles]

514
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,074
You are very smart, seòor.

515
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,482
And you are very impolite.

516
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,855
Unless it is the custom

517
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,060
to try to make a fool of strangers
in this little place.

518
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,852
[coin rattles]

519
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,859
That's for your pulque,
amigo.

520
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,660
Flaco,
you been in Batopilas?

521
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,966
Sí.

522
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,835
Is there a woman
there named Catamaria

523
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,400
who is famous for
her chicken mole?

524
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,779
There is only one
cantina in Batopilas

525
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,008
run by a blind man
named Pedro

526
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,684
and his chicken mole
is terrible.

527
00:45:58,622 --> 00:45:59,611
Hmm.

528
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,746

529
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:03,782

(Ramos)
Against the wall.

533
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,833
Now, who are you?

534
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,871
I'm coming from the north,
seòor.

535
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,712
I'm going to my
home in Batopilas.

536
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,846
Then you are not one
of Chuy's pistoleros

537
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,718
Iooking for
some lamb to roast?

538
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:41,755
No, seòor.

539
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:43,648
(Ramos)
Ah.

540
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,459
Batopilas, eh?

541
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,526
You go to Cocatlan, seòor?

542
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,429
Yes.

543
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,696
[speaks Spanish]

544

Is it?

724
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:35,897
If I lose, seòor,
I fill my belly with tequila

725
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,105
and I die with my woman.

726
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,936
If you lose, seòor,

727
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,470
what is your wish?

728
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,280
A priest?

729
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,681
We have no priests
in Cocatlan.

730
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,947
But we have a church.

731
01:04:56,425 --> 01:05:00,452
If you lose, seòor,
I will see to it personally

732
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,090
that you die in the church.

733
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,756
Bueno?

734
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,830
I'm not worried about losing.

735
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,668
I'm just thinking about
what's gonna happen if I win.

736
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:16,700
Hmm?

737
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:19,872
I said, I'm worried about
what happens if I win.

738
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,813
Lazaro,

739
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:26,184
the gringo is afraid for his life,
if he should win.

740
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,283
Lazaro, if I lose,

741
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:33,453
bring him his horse

742
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,862
and escort him
safely away from Cocatlan.

743
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,135
(Chuy)
Now, we begin.

01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,406

[grunts]

749
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,746
Seòor, many
generations of the Medina

750
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,760
have defended
Cocatlan with their hands.

751
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,998
Before my family,
you gringos come

752
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:27,499
and take horses, gold,

753
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,397
women, whatever you wish.

754
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,905
Now, seòor,
because of the Medina,

755
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:39,172
it is we who take things

756
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:43,284
and bring them
back to Cocatlan.

757
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,578
I gave you your chance.

758
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,151
Adiós, amigo.

01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:02,653
Good?

764
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:03,787

767
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,991
Is he alive?

768
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,861
I do not know. He was.

769
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:55,811
We have looked everywhere.

770
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:57,680
She is not in Cocatlan.

771
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,214
She must have
gone with the gringo.

772
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,222
Find them.

773
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,691
Muy bien, Chuy.

774
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,362
[door shuts]

775
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,813
(Ramos) It is a grave
I have dug for myself.

776
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:35,354
One day when l
am tired of living,

777
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:39,256
I will come here
for a long rest.

778
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,057
Go down.

779
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,029
I must cover you both.

780
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:48,092
But it is a grave.

781
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:52,569
That is a word.
This is a place of safety.

782
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:57,343
You must hide here now.

783
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,713
Come.

784
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:08,988

[wind howling]

786
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,420
Where are we?

787
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,192
Ramos says you must be quiet.

788
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,756
How long have we been here?

789
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,392
Most of the night.

790
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,467
[goat bleats]

791
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,376
Ramos says we will be safe here
for a little while.

792
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,447
Where is the old man?

793
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:10,717
He is in his hut.

794
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:14,383
Did you haul me here?

795
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:15,751
Yes.

796
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,052
Thanks.

797
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:27,191
You must drink this.

798
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,567
As much as you can.

799
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:35,069
Ramos made it from herbs.

800
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,008
[Matt groans]

801
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,246
You've done about
all for me that you can.

802
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,522
You better get on back now.

803
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,418
No.

804
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,161
If you go back now, you might have to
take a bad licking,

805
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,098
but he's not gonna kill you.

806
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,135
You're too
good-looking to kill.

807
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,500
I do not go back.

808
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:11,378
Will you bring me with you

809
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,041
just to the border?

810
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,909
Lady...

811
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,279
[sighs]

812
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:25,682
I, uh...

813
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,527
I can't even
bring my horse back.

814
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,727
I've come a long way
to wind up in this hole.

815
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:39,663
I probably won't get more than 5 feet
if I ever get out of it.

816
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,602
If he catches you trying to make
a run for it with me,

817
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,747
you won't have hardly any time
to say your prayers

818
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:52,677
before he'll
open up your back.

819
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:55,746
You're better off
staying here in Mexico.

820
01:14:56,992 --> 01:15:00,325
You've got some
pretty dresses

821
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,158
and you've got
some grub coming in.

822
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,393
You've got it
a whole lot better

823
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,529
than most of
the women I know.

824
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:18,441
I was 15 when my
father sold me to Chuy.

825
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:21,446
We were poor.

826
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,211
I was the only girl.

827
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,718
Chuy promised my father

828
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:31,281
that I would be his woman
and have a good life.

829
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:36,523
When I left, my mother gave me
her wedding dress.

830
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:41,291
I thought I would be
married in a church

831
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,039
with a priest
and all the pretty robes,

832
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,501
three rings,

833
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,340
silk cord
around our shoulders.

834
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,879
But there was
no priest in Cocatlan.

835
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,752
And I learned what
the good life was.

836
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,851
When Chuy's finished with me,

837
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:10,794
he will give me to his pistoleros
like the other girls.

838
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:17,402
I will not go back to that.

839
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:20,968
I would rather be dead.

840
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,602
All right.

841
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,282
We'll give her a try.

What can old Ramos
do for you?

Old Ramos will not
live to be any older

849
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,643
unless he tells me
where they are.

It is possible.

Iike the blood
of the Medina.

907
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,211
That you tie up your woman
like you tie up your horse.

908
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:41,680
Or she run away.

909
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,942
He say that
you are a coward.

910
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:47,111
Afraid to fight if we
are not with you to help.

911
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,480
He wait until tomorrow.

912
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:52,985
He wait to see
if you come alone.

913
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,434
You drink too much, amigo.

914
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:47,870
Hoya.

915
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,142
Where is the gringo?

916
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,346
He waits in
the high canyon, Chuy.

917
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:35,785
[horse neighs]

918
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:02,249
You think it is
like the gringo say?

919
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:06,118
I need help to fight?

920
01:31:07,094 --> 01:31:09,585
Pride is not enough, amigo.

921
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:33,142
[gun fires]

922
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:38,486
[gunfire continues]

923
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:52,804
[horse neighs]

924
01:32:12,226 --> 01:32:13,215
[nickers]

925
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:23,970
Now we can go.

926
01:32:59,807 --> 01:33:00,796
Mateo!

927
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:05,134
[gun fires]

928
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:28,757
[wind howling]

929
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:38,534
(Chuy)
Oha!

930
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,883
(Chuy)
Oha, gringo!

931
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:46,747
You ask me to come.

932
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,583
Here I am!

933
01:33:50,391 --> 01:33:53,485
What is it you wish
to do now, gringo?

934
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,957
I tell you what:

935
01:34:01,369 --> 01:34:05,465
send me my woman,
and I'll let you go.

936
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:08,568
(Chuy) I even let you
have your horse.

937
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:09,837
I will go.

938
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:11,205
Stay where you are.

939
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:14,340
A Medina always
keeps his word.

940
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,146
You know.

941
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:23,779
Gringo!

942
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,584
(Chuy)
Listen to me.

943
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:33,429
Soon my muchachos will come
to look for me.

944
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:37,670
Then you are finished,
gringo!

945
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:51,946
Do not be a fool, seòor!

946
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,488
I no longer wish to kill you!

947
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:02,152
But no man can take away
any woman of Chuy Medina.

948
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:12,766
You think maybe
you wait till tonight

949
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,364
and get away, seòor?

950
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:17,402
You make a mistake.

951
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:20,713
My pistoleros will
be here before then!

952
01:35:36,464 --> 01:35:39,160
(Chuy)
What do you say?

953
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:42,960
We make a deal, gringo?

954
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:48,536
Here's the deal, Medina.
You keep the horse.

955
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:51,534
(Matt)
I'm sending him out.

956
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:55,247
You send out your horse
and I will kill him

957
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:57,316
to start with.

958
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:59,681
He will kill the horse.

959
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,687
He'll have to show
his gun to do it.

960
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:05,381
He's all yours, Medina.

961
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,485
[neighs]

962
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,086

968
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:27,933
Mateo! It is Mateo!

969
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:33,235
Mateo!

970
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:37,372
Ana! It is Mateo!

971
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:39,208
[laughing]

972
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,449
(Ana)
Mateo!

973
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:49,461
[Ana speaking Spanish]

974
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:50,519
Mateo!

975
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:53,328

Mateo! Mateo!

976

Mateo!

978

Mateo!
