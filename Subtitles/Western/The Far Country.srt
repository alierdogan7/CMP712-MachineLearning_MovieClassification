1
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,636
Is that the herd you told us about?
Yeah.

2
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:41,843
Finest beef that ever come into Seattle.

3
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:44,395
All the way from Wyoming, and here he be.

4
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,717
- Hi, Jeff. How are you, boy?
- Where do I tag them?

5
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,321
Take them down to the dock.
We'll run them aboard.

6
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:51,557
- How'd you do, boy?
- Not too bad.

7
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:52,966
- Lose a few head?
- A few.

8
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,685
You started with four men.

9
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,042
- Two of them tried to turn back.
- I see.

10
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:01,122
Hold them right there. That's good.

11
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:09,086
You owe these fellows $200 for the drive.
Pay them off.

12
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,885
Correct. $200.

13
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:14,600
Tom, here's $100 for you...

14
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,885
and $100 for you, Joe.

15
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,805
Here are your guns.

16
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:30,160
All right, you've been waiting for 500 miles.
Go ahead and use them.

17
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,323
I'll live to see you hang.

18
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,965
I guess I forgot to shake hands.
How are you, Ben?

19
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,446
- I'm fine.
- Still got your pipe?

20
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:57,280
- Sure.
- Here it is. You're looking good.

21
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:00,165
You look good, too.
I see you're still wearing the bell.

22
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,284
You wouldn't want me to lose it, right?
I should say not.

23
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,835
Don't suppose there's sense
in asking what happened?

24
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:08,202
- No.
- That's what I figured.

25
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,720
Captain Benson.

26
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:13,796
Meet my partner. He said he'd be on time
with them cattle, and here he is.

27
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:16,447
You got just 10 minutes to get them loaded.

28
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:19,082
- He don't like cattle.
- No, I guess he doesn't.

29
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:23,399
Quit poking them steers. That's beef.
What do you want to do, bruise them?

30
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,399
Haul in your gangplank.

31
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,365
Cast off all lines.

32
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:17,676
We got us a stateroom, real exclusive.
You, me, and one other.

33
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:21,522
- No, that's this lady's. Ours is a him.
- Excuse me.

34
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:24,838
Rube Morris from the Klondike.
He's a bit shaggy, but he's clean.

35
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:28,715
There he is. Open the door, Rube.
Say hello to my partner, Jeff Webster.

36
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:30,320
- Howdy.
- Hello.

37
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,359
Locked. Ain't got no key.

38
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:37,565
See the Captain. Get a key. The man's tired,
he's got to lay himself down.

39
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:40,445
Captain Benson, hold up!
You got a killer on board.

40
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:44,964
There he is, by the rail. The tall one.
Bring her in, do you hear me?

41
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,686
Don't talk like a fool, Walters.
This isn't a rowboat.

42
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:51,237
Bring her in! There's a killing charge
against that man on the lower deck!

43
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,965
Sorry. You'll have to wait.

44
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:56,642
I'll put him in custody and hand
him over to you on the return voyage.

45
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:58,126
Take him down to the brig.

46
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:01,085
Better put him in irons,
as long as he's a killer.

47
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,681
Full ahead.
Pull her north by northwest.

48
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:07,717
Come on down, Joe.

49
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:13,360
I'll take that gun.

50
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:28,561
In here.

51
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:33,761
Hide in the bed.

52
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:37,876
In the bed.

53
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:40,921
With spurs?

54
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:44,279
Open up!
They'll be here in just a minute.

55
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:55,959
Anyone in here?
Use your passkey, boatswain.

56
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,725
I'm sorry.
I should think you would be.

57
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:06,243
We are looking for a man, a killer.
In my stateroom?

58
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:09,201
I didn't know you were in.
You know it now.

59
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:11,359
And lock the door.

60
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:19,961
I imagine you look better with a shave.

61
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,919
My razor's in my saddlebag.

62
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,479
Unless you've got one.

63
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,759
If you put the key in the door and turn it...

64
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,566
- they can't use a passkey.
- I know that.

65
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:34,756
Then you figured?

66
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,963
Can you think of anything more convincing?

67
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:40,357
No, and I'll tell you something else.
I can't think why you did it.

68
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,358
Do I have to have a reason?

69
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:46,003
- Nobody ever did anything for nothing.
- You're right.

70
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,883
- I may need a friend in Skagway.
- And in the meantime?

71
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,886
In the meantime,
I'll tell your partners where you are...

72
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:55,322
and when it's safe,
you can go to your own cabin.

73
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,159
And in the meantime?

74
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,480
Say "thanks."

75
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,442
That's a term I seldom use.

76
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,804
Open the door, it's me.
I got us some food.

77
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,803
Soup and beef.
What kind of soup?

78
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:29,639
Just soup soup.

79
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,803
$5 for the beef and taters.

80
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,355
$5?
Skagway prices.

81
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,083
Beef bringing $1 a pound on the hoof.

82
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,204
Bringing better than $10 a pound
dressed in Dawson.

83
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:45,881
Burned the taters.
But we're gonna be rich, Jeff, yes, sir.

84
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:50,315
Just as soon as you drive that herd
to the Klondike, we'll be rich.

85
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:54,195
- Are they still looking for me up on deck?
- No, they surely give up.

86
00:07:55,567 --> 00:08:00,243
Cold. Wouldn't you'd think at these prices
they'd put a little fire under the coffee?

87
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:02,923
Set yourself down, son.

88
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:06,802
- Where's your food?
- I don't need food if I can have my coffee.

89
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:09,557
Yeah, about 10 gallons a day.

90
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,956
Hope there's plenty of that stuff
up in Dawson.

91
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,800
Old Rube says we can't drive to Dawson.

92
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:17,447
He says there's glaciers, snow, ice,
and suchlike.

93
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,361
- He thinks we're crazy.
- What do you think?

94
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:22,756
I think we're crazy, too,
but we're gonna be rich.

95
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:26,886
Then we're gonna get that ranch in Utah,
you and me, and settle down.

96
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,923
Good old Skagway.

97
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:53,084
Everybody's gone but us.

98
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,680
- Gone where?
- Gone.

99
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,639
They've gone ashore.
Where do you think they've gone?

100
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:01,082
We're in Skagway.
Skagway.

101
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,603
Look. Four new saloons since last month.

102
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:08,437
Where'd everybody go at?
Come on.

103
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:10,483
Town's real empty.
Come on, now.

104
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,922
- Nice folks in Skagway.
- Yeah, I know.

105
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,679
Four new saloons.

106
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,523
At least I won't go dry.

107
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,804
Hurry up,
I gotta get them critters off this tub.

108
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:25,639
My, how Skagway grew.
Give me that bottle.

109
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:31,886
- Now, what for you do that?
- On account of Maggie, that's what for!

110
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,356
You passed me your word no more drinking.

111
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,757
You're taking your gold back
to your wife in Missouri this time.

112
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:39,997
That's a sobering thought.

113
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:45,075
Here's your hay bill.
I've come to get my cattle.

114
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,965
I'll take another $500
for handling.

115
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,925
Handling? You don't handle cattle.
Cattle handle theirselves.

116
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,237
- Somebody had to feed them.
- That was in the deal.

117
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,476
Not the way I see it.

118
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,684
We don't want any argument.
$500 more, or you don't get the cattle.

119
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,120
First off, I ain't got $500.

120
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,722
Second, I hear stories about you people
cheating and thieving like this.

121
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,763
And third...
Open the gate, Rube!

122
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:06,326
Give me a hand here, Ben.

123
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,566
All right.

124
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,719
Now it becomes my duty...

125
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:33,277
to carry out the sentence
which I have imposed on these men...

126
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:37,241
for killing and stealing
within the territory under my jurisdiction.

127
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:39,880
However...

128
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:44,639
I want it strictly understood that
there'll be no undue shouting or cheering...

129
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,400
or drunken talk when I pull that lever...

130
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,797
on account of
it offends the dignity of the occasion.

131
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,124
What's going on here?

132
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:04,000
You, there.

133
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:07,684
- It got a little out of hand. I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

134
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,679
You just busted up a function of the law,
that's what you did.

135
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,758
The people of Skagway
don't like lawbreakers.

136
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,202
They go to a lot of trouble and expense
to prove it.

137
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:18,199
New gallows and ropes,
13 steps counted out right and proper...

138
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:20,596
with each step costing
not less than $12 per each...

139
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:23,406
and you drive a herd of cattle
through the population.

140
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:27,002
You busted up everything,
that's what you did. And you're sorry.

141
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,476
That's right, I'm sorry.
Hold on.

142
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:32,680
You're not going anywhere.
Shall I dump them?

143
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:35,766
No, leave them be.
We'll save them till Sunday.

144
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:40,079
Mr. Gannon, you got no quarrel with him.
It was me turned them cows loose.

145
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:44,160
Don't tell me who to quarrel with.
You're supposed to be in Missouri.

146
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:47,796
Well, I went broke in Seattle.
Put them back in jail.

147
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,484
You go along with them.

148
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:55,677
- What about this man? He's all right.
- He ain't all right. He busted up my hanging.

149
00:11:56,687 --> 00:12:00,965
All right, get down and speak your piece,
although it won't do you any good.

150
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,244
It's a plain case of disorderly conduct...

151
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:05,636
with an attempt to kill
half the people of Skagway.

152
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:08,605
It's more than that.
He's wanted for a murder in Seattle.

153
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,838
Seattle will have wait.
He's wanted here for busting up a hanging.

154
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:14,760
However, I'll add that charge
and try him for both crimes.

155
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:17,839
I agreed to take him back.
And I'll take his partner along, too.

156
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:20,441
You'll take nobody. Get out.

157
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,123
Take his gun and lock him up.

158
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,478
Were you thinking of using that?

159
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:33,845
No, I was just showing your deputy
where to find it.

160
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:39,316
I'm gonna like you.
I'm gonna hang you, but I'm gonna like you.

161
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:42,160
Thank you very much.
Lock him up.

162
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,886
Thank you.

163
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:53,680
- Can't you keep out of trouble?
- Sure doesn't look like it, does it?

164
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:02,840
Company for you.

165
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,483
This is Doc Vallon,
best doc in Skagway.

166
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:12,560
Yes, because I am the only doctor
in Skagway. So I am the best one.

167
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:17,200
<i>Will you ask the learned Monsieur Gannon
to consider my case quickly?</i>

168
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:21,075
I wouldn't crowd him. He's pretty sore.
Figures you could've saved Gigi's hand.

169
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,045
But the bones were crushed.
There was nothing but to amputate.

170
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:27,085
Maybe, but you sure ruined
a good piano player.

171
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,882
Do you mind?
No, not at all. Make yourself at home.

172
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:35,199
The medical profession,
it is most difficult in Alaska.

173
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:39,195
- Why did you come here?
- Because I'm going to Vienna.

174
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:46,886
Huckleberry, you spilled my soup.

175
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:50,004
As a favour, Renee, my name's Newberry.
Frank Newberry.

176
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:54,126
Old berry, new berry. To me,
you Huckleberry and it's a nice name.

177
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,878
It's good to see you still alive.

178
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,640
Papa, here's our soup.

179
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,885
You're the man with the cows.
That's right.

180
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,446
I think I like you.

181
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:08,918
Well, I think I like you, too.

182
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:11,840
You'll like me much better
when you hear me sing.

183
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:15,922
<i>But you may not hear me sing
if they hang you.</i>

184
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,360
No, probably not.

185
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,800
That's too bad.

186
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:25,164
- Papa, our soup.
- Soup, soup. Always I must eat.

187
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:28,684
And you mustn't read while you eat.

188
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,839
It's bad for the stomach, right?
Yes.

189
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,395
Here, why don't you take my seat, Doc?

190
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,160
Mr. Gannon wants you in court
to hear your trial.

191
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:40,523
That's fair enough. So long, Doc.
I'll go with you.

192
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,201
Now, you hear?
You don't read while you eat.

193
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,282
Thank you.

194
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,762
- This is where I sing. Is it not elegant?
- It's real nice.

195
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:57,519
The court's in here, too.

196
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,080
- Rube!
- I'm back!

197
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:04,001
- It's good to see you.
- Shame on you.

198
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:07,602
- That? That's sodie pop. It tastes horrible.
- Soda pop?

199
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:14,676
- What have I done?
- You spilled half an ounce of gold dust.

200
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:16,917
That'll cost you a kiss, baby.

201
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:20,077
Look, you're new around here.

202
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:22,765
Don't do that again.

203
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,882
Deputy. Order in the court.

204
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,199
Bring in the prisoner.

205
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,562
Careful. He plays rough.

206
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,882
So I noticed. Who is he?

207
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,840
- He's the law in Skagway.
- I see.

208
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,680
Bring my gavel.

209
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,166
Stand up. Take your hat off.

210
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:53,441
Leave that.

211
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:59,036
Court's in session.
Everybody keep shut or get throwed out.

212
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:04,002
Seattle business first.
Where's that boat captain?

213
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,645
You want me to get him?

214
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:06,921
No, never mind.

215
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,239
Who'd you kill?

216
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,479
Two men.
Why?

217
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:18,839
They were driving a herd of cattle
up from Wyoming and tried to turn back.

218
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,565
So you shot them?

219
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:24,721
Seems like a man ought to have
a right to leave if he wants to leave.

220
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:28,846
Even if he's driving trail,
that don't give you no reason to shoot him.

221
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,760
<i>If he wants to turn back, he can turn back.</i>

222
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:36,246
I figured they should not have turned back
and taken my cattle with them.

223
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,439
That's a point well-taken.

224
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,595
Of course...

225
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,046
you could have shot them in the back.

226
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:52,164
You don't look like
you'd shoot a man in the back.

227
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,597
Have a drink. You're acquitted.

228
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:06,165
Now, about them cattle.

229
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,206
I told you about them cows...
Keep shut, Rube.

230
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,557
How much you figure
they're worth?

231
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:14,717
That just depends on where I sell them.

232
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,400
You ain't gonna sell them.

233
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:20,160
They've been seized by the court
in lieu of your fine...

234
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,841
on account of
you're guilty of disturbing the peace...

235
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:27,079
to almost killing 50 people,
and disrupting a legal proceeding.

236
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,395
Have a drink.

237
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:38,800
Court's adjourned.

238
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,484
- Aren't you satisfied?
- Why did you have to take his cattle?

239
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:58,640
Because I wanted them.
Or isn't that a good enough reason?

240
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,920
Give me his gun.

241
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,723
- Does this go as it stands?
- He's the law.

242
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,324
Yeah, but that's our herd of cattle.

243
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,762
- Give me the gun.
- No, not with him.

244
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,398
Here's your gun, mister.

245
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm happy they didn't hang you.

246
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,003
- Now you can hear me sing.
- Some other time.

247
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:41,397
No, I'm going to sing right now.
Come on, some other time.

248
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,403
You're not being very nice.

249
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,518
Had to give yourself an edge.

250
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,563
- A little one.
- A little one.

251
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:55,920
I'm gonna like you.

252
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:59,325
Let's all have a drink. Tell Steve to play.

253
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:01,365
Thank you, freckle face.

254
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,923
I am not a freckle face.

255
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:11,040
Now that you're broke,
what are you gonna do?

256
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:15,120
Almost anything.
I might even try for your job.

257
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,645
That's been tried by a few.

258
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:25,156
I could use a new deputy. $10 a day, gold.

259
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,165
I don't think I'd like to work for you,
Mr. Gannon.

260
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:32,125
Suit yourself.
Come and see me when you get hungry.

261
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,675
Excuse me,
but maybe we ain't gonna get hungry.

262
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,436
Maybe we'll just push on up the Yukon
and stake us out a claim.

263
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,125
When are you gonna leave?

264
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,926
We were thinking
maybe we'd pull out tomorrow morning.

265
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,282
That is, if we still have our horses.

266
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:50,637
The government ain't interested in horses,
but it is interested in your grubstake.

267
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:53,800
- You got one?
- How much do we have left?

268
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:57,118
$50 or thereabouts.
Enough to buy flour, salt, coffee...

269
00:19:57,207 --> 00:19:59,562
shovel and a pan. We can kill our meat.

270
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:04,042
- Ain't enough.
- You let us worry about that.

271
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:07,517
That's just what I can't do
on account of the line.

272
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,246
What line's that?
The Canadian line.

273
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:13,200
You need 100 pounds of food
to cross the line.

274
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:15,164
Come along, I'll show you.

275
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:22,642
- I want to sing for you.
- You're real pretty.

276
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,600
Latigo, when are you leaving?

277
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,803
Tonight. We're checked out and ready to go.

278
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:30,606
Dakota here,
he'll drive trail for you tomorrow.

279
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,196
I won't need him.

280
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:47,166
- Ma'am, he's the best driver in the country.
- I said I won't need him.

281
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,406
110 pounds. That's good.

282
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,047
Set it next to the wall.
Pick it up in the morning.

283
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,446
Suppose someone rob it.

284
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:01,644
Nobody gonna rob in Skagway.
Do like you're told.

285
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,121
Next man.

286
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:09,676
85 pounds. You're 15 pounds light.

287
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,839
But I can get by on 85 pounds.
I don't eat much, hardly nothing.

288
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,724
You'll eat. When you run short...

289
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,561
you'll kill and steal what belongs to
somebody else as you won't have enough.

290
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:21,036
Now get in there
and buy another 15 pounds of food.

291
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:23,561
But, Mr. Gannon,
I worked 2 months for this stuff.

292
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:25,285
Do like you're told.

293
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:29,760
- Is that a government rule?
- That's my rule.

294
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,202
- You sell the food.
- For cash only.

295
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,645
There she is, there's the border.

296
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:38,561
Everything the other side of them hills
is all Canadian territory.

297
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:43,802
- Do they take this lying down?
- Well, ain't we?

298
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,445
I guess we are.

299
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:02,162
I told you I might need a friend.
I'm going on up into Dawson.

300
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:04,397
What you need is 100 pounds of food.

301
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:06,444
I'm carrying a few thousand.

302
00:22:06,527 --> 00:22:08,882
That's mine, and the rest goes up
in the morning.

303
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,242
If I can find a man to ride point.

304
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:16,442
Your pay's 100 pounds of food,
another 100 pounds for Ben.

305
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,923
You just hired a driver.

306
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,197
Joe, it's time to close up.

307
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:28,924
Honey, that weren't no accident.

309
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:31,965
She gonna give you 200 pounds of food
to trail drive for her?

310
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,275
That's what she said.

311
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,835
- Where'd she get all this money?
- I don't know.

312
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:38,646
- Rube, who all is this woman?
- Which woman?

313
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:40,797
This woman which hired Jeff. Who is she?

314
00:22:40,887 --> 00:22:43,401
Who is she? You're sitting on her furniture.

315
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,878
She owns this place. Skagway Castle.
Didn't you see it up over the door?

316
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,276
Skagway. That's kind of a funny name
for a woman.

317
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,720
Her name is Ronda.

318
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:55,163
But you better call her "Miss Castle"
on account you work for her.

319
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:56,839
Come on, Rube. Move your feet.

320
00:22:56,927 --> 00:23:00,078
Ain't no use nudging my elbow.
There's no dust in my poke.

321
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:02,841
If there were, I wouldn't nudge it anyway.

322
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:06,722
This Castle woman, is she gonna open up
another place in Dawson?

323
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,082
That's how come you got the job.

324
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:12,200
- She kind of likes you.
- I kind of like her.

325
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,080
Closing up, gents.

326
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,643
Front door's locked. Use the side.

327
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:26,959
- Find any colour, honey?
- Real high-grade tonight.

328
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:29,277
Was it hickory or yellow pine?

329
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,920
Look at that.

330
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:34,960
You mean to say that gold comes from that?

331
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:38,484
You don't think she sing in that saloon
all night for nothing.

332
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:41,718
Renee's got the sawdust concession.
She does pretty good.

333
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:43,957
- Do you want to try it?
- Sure. What do I do?

334
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,163
- Sit down.
- All right.

335
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:50,117
- Now you put water on it.
- Put water on it.

336
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,562
- No, not like that.
- Too much water?

337
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:53,921
Look. Here.

338
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:55,522
This way.

339
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:59,202
This is liable to take a couple of hours.
You guys might as well go to bed.

340
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:00,925
Good night.
Good night.

341
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,326
That's the way.

342
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,999
- Is that enough water?
- Yes.

343
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:05,679
All right, there we go.

344
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:09,203
<i>- There's... No, there was some.
- Try again.</i>

345
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,405
- You just...
- Are you really going to go to Dawson?

346
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,085
With that woman?

347
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:16,760
Miss Castle? Yeah.

348
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,480
Do you like her?

349
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:21,679
She's quite a woman.

350
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,725
No, I lost it again.

351
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,367
You'd better take it
or I'll lose your night's work.

352
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,165
There's lots more.

353
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,600
Elbow-nudger.

354
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:35,596
- There's worse things than elbow nudging.
- Yeah, I suppose so.

355
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:38,802
You know, you're very handsome.

356
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,681
- I like tall men with...
- Look at this.

357
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:44,520
- Here's some. Give me the poke.
- Here.

358
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:47,838
There's a lot of gold there.

359
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:50,395
It takes a lot of gold
to become a stomach specialist.

360
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,603
- Is that so?
- Yes, I'm sending Papa to Vienna...

361
00:24:52,687 --> 00:24:55,679
- to study stomach.
- Couldn't find any in Alaska?

362
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:58,885
Now you're laughing at me.
Well, I don't know.

363
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,515
Washing out a whole lot of tired,
old sawdust...

364
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:04,440
so you can send somebody to Vienna
to study stomachs.

365
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:06,518
Papa can't wash gold.

366
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:09,640
You've got to help people
when they need help.

367
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,001
Why?

368
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:13,796
- Don't you?
- I take care of me.

369
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,204
When you're older,
you'll find that's the only way.

370
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:18,681
Good night.

371
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:21,444
I'm quite old now!

372
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:33,321
The pack horses are ready,
Miss Castle.

373
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,886
- Who are these fellows?
- Drivers. I hired them.

374
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:40,562
This is your first trip into Dawson.
They know the trail.

375
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:44,003
I find my own trails, and I do my own hiring.

376
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,195
So do I.

377
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:55,003
All right, let's move them along.
All right, move them out!

378
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:58,796
Ronda girl,
I think I should have hung that man.

379
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:20,161
Wait a minute,
you can't leave old Rube in Skagway.

380
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,841
Why, you old goat.
Where'd you get the grubstake?

381
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:24,679
From my sweetheart.

382
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:27,684
Keep up the elbow-nudging.

383
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,679
- Be careful and goodbye.
- Goodbye, freckle face.

384
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,645
I'm not a freckle face! I'm a woman.

385
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:38,766
And beef's selling for $5 a pound
in Dawson.

386
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:41,365
Sure is a shame.

387
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:43,996
Come on.

388
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:26,715
All right!

389
00:27:57,127 --> 00:27:59,436
Hello, Mrs. Kingman.
Where's the constable at?

390
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:02,041
Up on the Pelly River.
Trouble with the Chilkats.

391
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:06,803
You give him my very best when he's home.
Hello, Skookum. You're getting real big.

392
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,405
Get up, boy. Bye.

393
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,237
He got a real tough job, that constable.

394
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:20,002
He patrols some 20,000 square miles
full of nothing but hill and hollow.

395
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:23,079
Sometime he don't get home
for two and three months at a time...

396
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,123
riding up in that far country.

397
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,206
You're going the wrong way, Jeff.

398
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,562
The trail's straight ahead.
I know.

399
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:08,841
Come on.

400
00:29:09,687 --> 00:29:11,405
Come on down here.

401
00:29:15,527 --> 00:29:17,961
You missed the trail.
It runs straight up.

402
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,800
We're gonna make night camp
right here in this canyon.

403
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:23,321
Night camp?
We still got three hours of daylight.

404
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:26,046
When do you expect
to get to Dawson? Next fall?

405
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:28,880
Trail driver.
Wyoming style. He'll learn.

406
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,003
I don't want to argue,
but Gant's right.

407
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:34,921
We're not gonna argue.
We're gonna make night camp right here.

408
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:38,158
Now go up and get the horses.

409
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:48,239
"This causes inflammation
of the mucous membrane of the stomach...

410
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,564
"secretion of an excessive quantity
of mucous...

411
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:54,207
"and alteration of the gastric juice."

412
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:58,525
- Is that an ulcer?
- Gastritis. The ulcer comes later.

413
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,477
Do you know that
we have some very interesting ulcers...

414
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,762
on Page 425?

415
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:09,155
What's that?

416
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:13,795
- Can't you hear it?
- Can I help but hear? Cows.

417
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:19,801
- Do you know a cow has four stomachs?
- Be quiet, Papa.

418
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:15,959
All right, let's go!

419
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:29,003
I knew our luck was too good to last.

420
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:31,999
You keep them moving.
I'll go down and have a look.

421
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,765
Stop right there.

422
00:32:46,847 --> 00:32:47,916
Jeff!

423
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,923
They told Mr. Gannon about the cows.

424
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:54,521
- How did you know I was here?
- I saw you at the corral.

425
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:57,360
- Mr. Gannon is very mad.
- Yeah, I can understand that.

426
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,600
Tell Ben and Rube
to run the cattle across the border...

427
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,043
- then get back in town as quick as you can.
- All right.

428
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:27,081
Hurry. Gannon, he's after the cattle.

429
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:05,206
- Is there something you want, Mr. Gannon?
- Yeah, mostly I want you.

430
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:08,764
I also want that herd.
It's government property.

431
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:12,237
- I'm sorry. I reversed your decision.
- Where is he?

432
00:34:12,327 --> 00:34:15,080
- Can you see him?
- No, can you?

433
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:18,443
What did you expect? To talk him to death?
Follow me.

434
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:20,325
Lost three?

435
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:24,241
Next time you follow me, stay a little closer.
You'll live longer.

436
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:39,158
Hold it right here.
Another five jumps, and we got him.

437
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:40,805
You sure you want him?

438
00:35:40,927 --> 00:35:43,566
This marks the end
of my territory of jurisdiction.

439
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,842
I don't plan no invasion of Canada.

440
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:50,159
Jeff, you holed up out there?

441
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:51,715
That's right.

442
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:54,639
That's what I figured.

443
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:57,282
Waiting to get us as we cross the line?

444
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,642
Yeah, seemed like a good idea.

445
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,877
Still want to take those five jumps?

446
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:07,362
Have a nice trip!
I'll hang you when you come back!

447
00:36:07,727 --> 00:36:11,276
What makes you think I'm coming?
You will.

448
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:14,757
When the winter sets in,
everybody comes back through Skagway.

449
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:16,917
It's the only way out.

450
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:38,638
We'll wait here a spell.
He'll be along directly.

451
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:43,037
What gets me is, how'd you know
we was after them cattle? Did you see us?

452
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:46,802
Yes, but first I heard the bell.
The little bell Jeff wears on his saddle.

453
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:49,799
That. He won't ride without it.

454
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,755
- I gave it to him, you know.
- You did? Why?

455
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:55,920
A couple of years back,
we was down in Mexico...

456
00:36:56,007 --> 00:37:00,046
and I bought this bell for our house.
We're gonna have a house in Utah.

457
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:03,324
We're gonna hang that
right over the front door, on the inside...

458
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:06,877
so as when you open the door,
the bell jingles, you see?

459
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:09,837
On account I'd like to know
when my friends come...

460
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,077
so I can put on another pot of coffee.

461
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:14,283
But that's a very little bell.

462
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,962
It's going to be a very little house.

463
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:21,441
I thought I told you to go back
to Skagway.

464
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:24,121
You did, but Ben told me I could stay.

465
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:26,880
I'd guess we'd better move
them critters along.

466
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:28,956
Come on!

467
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:40,875
I see Ben's been giving out a lot of
information. Did he tell you about those?

468
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,161
- The timber wolves?
- Yeah.

469
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:45,364
- I know about them. I know lots of things.
- I see.

470
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,315
You're gonna be a nuisance.

471
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:49,796
What am I gonna do with you
when we get to Dawson?

472
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:52,447
You don't have to do anything
when we get to Dawson.

473
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:55,564
I'm going to work on the claim with Rube.
We're partners.

474
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:59,560
- But what happens to Doc?
- He's going to go to Vienna on a boat.

475
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:03,162
And then I'll send him more money
while he's studying stomachs.

476
00:38:03,607 --> 00:38:06,758
Now, wait a minute. Just hold on.

477
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,039
What happens to you?

478
00:38:09,127 --> 00:38:11,402
I'll pan a lot of dust
and make a lot of money.

479
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:13,398
I see. What then?

480
00:38:13,647 --> 00:38:16,957
Well, then I think
mostly I'd like to get married...

481
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:22,717
to a tall man with brown hair,
and I'd like to live in San Francisco.

482
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:25,925
Do you like San Francisco?

483
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:27,762
No.

484
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:32,480
That's what Ben told me.
He said you don't like any place very much.

485
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,320
You know what he said?
He said you don't even like people.

486
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:38,285
Is there any reason why I should?
Of course.

487
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:39,962
Why?

488
00:38:40,047 --> 00:38:42,641
Because if you don't like people,
they won't like you.

489
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:46,242
And then you'll be lonely like him.

490
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:47,396
Him?

491
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:52,204
You know, maybe he likes to be lonely.
Did you ever think of that?

492
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:55,120
He never asks any favours
because he can take care of himself.

493
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,995
Never trusts anybody so he doesn't get hurt.
That's not a bad way to live.

494
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,442
Maybe you'll learn that
when you grow up, huh?

495
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,686
Come on.

496
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:12,198
All right. Run them up in there.

497
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:23,884
Good morning.
I can see you had a busy night.

498
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:27,479
Yeah. Those are my cattle,
and I'm taking them to Dawson.

499
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,001
I said nothing about cattle in our deal.

500
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,998
Nope, it was my idea.

501
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:35,885
Nobody ever does anything
for nothing, remember?

502
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,798
You know what happens
when Mr. Gannon finds out you took them?

503
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:41,320
Yeah, I know.

504
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,524
I ain't making no drive to Dawson
with them cattle.

505
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,196
That goes for me, too.
And me.

506
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,562
That makes it almost unanimous.

507
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,400
You like to cast your vote, Miss Castle?

508
00:39:57,047 --> 00:40:00,517
I guess I was a convenience
to get you over the border.

509
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:04,282
Let's say we were both convenient.

510
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:09,999
It's a long way to Dawson. Get them moving.

511
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:57,602
Look. There go your customers.

512
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:59,917
<i>That bunch has been holed up there
for a month...</i>

513
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:01,679
<i>just waiting for the weather to break.</i>

514
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:04,520
<i>They'll be stringing across that ice
all summer.</i>

515
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:08,642
<i>Now let's see what the man from Wyoming
can do with that trail.</i>

516
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:21,517
There it is, Mr. Trail Driver.

517
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,246
White Horse Pass. 2 miles, straight up.

518
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:25,806
Real pretty.

519
00:41:25,927 --> 00:41:28,122
We better get going
while we still got daylight.

520
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:31,677
We're not going over White Pass.
We're going down through the valley.

521
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:35,965
- That's the long way around.
- Six days longer, in case you're interested.

522
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:38,083
- I'm not.
- Why?

523
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:41,125
Because there's no grass up there on the ice
for his cattle.

524
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:45,325
I don't care about your cattle.
I hired you to take my supplies into Dawson.

525
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:48,319
That's what I'm doing, my way.
Even if it's wrong.

526
00:41:48,407 --> 00:41:50,841
I wouldn't jump to no conclusions, mister.

527
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:53,999
Maybe Jeff don't figure it's safe
to climb that ledge.

528
00:41:54,247 --> 00:41:57,796
There's quite a few people
who don't agree with him, including me.

529
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:02,041
I figure we'll go down through the valley.

530
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:05,836
You keep forgetting that I hired you
and I give the orders.

531
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:08,197
We'll take the mountain trail.

532
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:10,955
Suit yourself.

533
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:17,919
Come on, Ben.
Let's get started down the valley.

534
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,686
Go ahead, Ben.

535
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,279
Wait a minute, mister!

536
00:42:26,607 --> 00:42:28,359
Something you want?

537
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,518
Is there something you want?

538
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,359
Why didn't you go her way?

539
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:01,642
- Lots of reasons.
- Name one.

540
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:05,119
Every once in a while,
it snows back in Wyoming.

541
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:07,920
It piles up on the tops
of the mountains, just like this.

542
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:09,326
Then what happens?

543
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:12,086
Come spring, just like this...

544
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:14,877
sometimes that snow begins to move.

545
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,197
- But you should have told her.
- Why?

546
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:19,847
Because if that snow moves,
somebody will get hurt.

547
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:23,203
That's quite possible.
But nobody can tell her anything.

548
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,156
She's a very strong-willed woman.

549
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:30,400
That's what I like about her.
Never sell that short, freckle face.

550
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:34,322
I am not a freckle face,
and I'm very strong-willed, too!

551
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:10,681
All right, hold it up a minute.
What's the matter?

552
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:13,565
I don't know.
Pie picked up a rock or something.

553
00:44:14,967 --> 00:44:17,003
You know, Jeff, that lves fellow's right.

554
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,841
Gonna take us at least six days
to get back on that main trail.

555
00:44:21,287 --> 00:44:22,845
Does it matter?

556
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:25,885
When you're after gold, it does.
First one there gets the best.

557
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:28,720
What are you fussing about?
There'll be enough to go around.

558
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:31,082
I ain't fussing. I got a claim.

559
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:34,360
Wait till you see gold in the pan
for the first time...

560
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:36,324
so rich and yellow-like.

561
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,604
Wait till you see it.
It does something to you.

562
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:42,045
It drives a man crazy.

563
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,486
- How did you know?
- I didn't.

564
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,997
I figured it would happen, and it did.

565
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:35,762
All right, come on. Let's move them along.

566
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:40,284
- We've got to go and help those people.
- Of course you do. They may be dead.

567
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:41,846
I didn't kill them.

568
00:45:41,927 --> 00:45:45,203
Yeah, but you may be able to save them
if they're still alive.

569
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:47,847
You're wrong, Jeff. You gotta help.

570
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,236
Why?

571
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,846
<i>If you don't know why...</i>

572
00:45:57,127 --> 00:45:58,799
You're wrong, Jeff.

573
00:46:04,047 --> 00:46:06,925
You stay here and keep an eye on the cattle.

574
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:31,646
I'll take care of your rigging, Jeff.
That's the last of it.

575
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,961
All we can salvage.
That's too bad.

576
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:44,199
How many did you lose?

577
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:46,960
Three men, six horses.
Unless you found any alive.

578
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:51,165
No, I didn't. Did you bury Gant?
Yeah, we buried him.

579
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,238
What about your people?

580
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,795
They're buried under 50 foot of snow.

581
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:11,923
Come over to the fire where it's warm.

582
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:14,441
There, have some coffee.
Thanks.

583
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:18,201
You sure you didn't get hurt none?

584
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:22,797
Say it. I was wrong.
You weren't wrong.

585
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,601
You were wrong about the trail, yes.

586
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,925
That was a long shot that didn't pay off,
that's all.

587
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:31,043
As for...
Being strong-willed?

588
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:33,083
There's nothing wrong with that.

589
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:36,284
That is, if you don't mind
getting a broken neck.

590
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,086
If I had, would it have bothered you?

591
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:41,196
No.

592
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:44,765
There's a fire over there.

593
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:48,044
If you're gonna stay here,
I'll get you a blanket.

594
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:04,485
Do you mind getting me some more coffee?

595
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:06,436
Sure.

596
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:18,560
- Thank you.
- You're learning.

597
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:33,804
Have some coffee, honey?
I hate coffee.

598
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:53,524
There it is up there, Two Mile Pass.
That's the only way to get into Dawson.

599
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:01,682
Look at them two coming out.

600
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:07,601
They must have hit it rich
and figured on getting home early.

601
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,963
Who's shooting and what at?

602
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:18,200
You two fellows look after the cattle.

603
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:40,400
I'm sorry.

604
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:54,840
They got old Chitina Joe
and Bill Gooder.

605
00:49:58,607 --> 00:50:00,882
Who done it, Bill? Say a name.

606
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:05,357
They couldn't have picked
a better spot for it.

607
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:08,405
- Is there much of this in Dawson?
- Ain't ever happened before.

608
00:50:08,487 --> 00:50:09,715
We're nice people in Dawson.

609
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:13,686
<i>We don't go around stealing and killing
like they do in Skagway.</i>

610
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:15,917
Ain't never happened before.

611
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:19,636
Take care of them.
Bring along the horses. We may need them.

612
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:22,322
Ain't you gonna look at what you hit?
Why?

613
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:24,716
I don't know. I might know him.

614
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:27,037
Aren't you really interested?

615
00:50:27,247 --> 00:50:30,478
- Is there any reason why I should be?
- That man's a thief.

616
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:33,240
- That's not why I shot him.
- Why did you?

617
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:35,124
Because he shot at me.

618
00:50:35,207 --> 00:50:37,562
Jeff, come over here!

619
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:49,720
Seems like I seen him in Skagway,
but I can't be sure.

620
00:50:56,647 --> 00:50:58,638
Well, guess I was wrong.

621
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:04,166
Hi, Rube!

622
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:25,717
Rube, thought you was going home
to Maggie. What happened?

623
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,397
What else could happen when
you back queens against aces? I went bust.

624
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:31,806
Renee, where's your pa?

625
00:51:31,887 --> 00:51:34,355
He went to Vienna to study stomachs.

626
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:39,042
You see Chitina Joe on your way out?
He left here three days ago with Bill.

627
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:42,278
I seen him. Joe's dead.
Who could have killed him?

628
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:45,325
So is Bill Gooder.
Both of them robbed and killed in Two Mile.

629
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:47,523
Nothing like this ever happened here before.

630
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:51,395
I knew it was coming. I warned you.
Where there's gold, there's stealing.

631
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:54,320
Where there's stealing, there's killing.
I knew it was coming.

632
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:57,160
You didn't know nothing.
Don't go pretending like you did.

633
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,364
We'll talk this out sensible later.
He did know, Hominy.

634
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:03,519
- Luke said where there's gold...
- Dusty, why don't you stop moaning?

635
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:05,723
You're always bellyaching
about the food.

636
00:52:05,807 --> 00:52:09,356
- Now keep shut.
- Food, you call it? Moose, caribou and bear.

637
00:52:09,447 --> 00:52:12,405
And them ain't young bears.
Them's old bears.

638
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:13,840
Hey, look.

639
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:16,726
<i>Look at that beef!</i>

640
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:19,241
I want me a steak
about 10 inches thick.

641
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:22,285
At $5 a pound?
I don't care what it costs. I'll pay.

642
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:24,358
I ain't had me a steak in six months.

643
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,723
Don't get too happy
till we find out what cost the cows.

644
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:31,038
- Rube, how much for your beef?
- Talk to the man.

645
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:38,037
Mister, I'm Hominy and she's Grits.

646
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:40,721
How much for your cows?
I haven't decided yet.

647
00:52:40,807 --> 00:52:43,605
When you do, let me know. I may buy them.

648
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,721
- I never did like that woman.
- I don't like her now.

649
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:52,117
Why don't you stay in Skagway
where you belong? Dawson ain't for you.

650
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:54,641
- Really?
- She's asking for it.

651
00:52:54,727 --> 00:52:56,206
I don't need no prompting.

652
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:59,120
On account of Skagway was a good town
before you moved in.

653
00:52:59,207 --> 00:53:02,324
Robbing and cheating miners
with your bad whiskey and fancy women.

654
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:05,524
<i>You made the place smell to high heavens.
But that weren't enough.</i>

655
00:53:05,607 --> 00:53:08,724
We worked hard in the gold field,
and you'd take it away in Skagway.

656
00:53:08,807 --> 00:53:12,163
<i>Now you come to Klondike
to catch them in the gold fields!</i>

657
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:15,637
Let me tell you, woman,
you ain't got Mr. Gannon backing you...

658
00:53:15,727 --> 00:53:19,515
with his gun and his badge. Not in Dawson.
You ain't welcome.

659
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:24,164
- How much for your cows?
- How much am I offered?

660
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:27,717
$1 a pound on the hoof
and that'll dress down to about...

661
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:30,966
$5 for eating beef, and I'll buy them all!

662
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:35,040
$1.50.
$1.50's been bid. Do I hear $2?

663
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:37,004
I'm tired of eating bear stew.

664
00:53:37,087 --> 00:53:41,285
I'll offer $2 a pound for one cow.
Dusty, you keep shut!

665
00:53:42,047 --> 00:53:44,003
$1.75!

666
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:46,203
$1.75 I'm bid. Do I hear $2?

667
00:53:46,287 --> 00:53:49,279
This is the finest beef
that ever come into the Klondike.

668
00:53:49,367 --> 00:53:53,076
Here come Molasses
with another bear, and it's a real old one.

669
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:56,125
Mister, I'll give you $50
for one slice of beef!

670
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:58,675
Keep shut, Dusty!
No. All or none, mister!

671
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:02,316
$1.75 once, twice...
$2.

672
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:11,122
Yeah, Miss Castle got the money.

673
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,444
Bear stew tonight, boys!
Bear stew, that's all!

674
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:26,202
- You just bought a herd of cattle.
- Stop by this evening, and I'll pay you.

675
00:54:26,287 --> 00:54:28,198
- Stop by where?
- The Dawson Castle.

676
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:30,596
It's going up right now, there.

677
00:54:31,487 --> 00:54:33,000
I'll be there.

678
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:43,159
Pete, drop us off in front.
Can't wait to get some stew.

679
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,645
That Dawson Castle's quite a place,
isn't it?

680
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:02,446
Jeff, you shouldn't have sold her your beef.

681
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:06,042
Hominy's has been here since
Dawson started. Look what you did to her.

682
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:09,563
- What have I done?
- You took away all of her customers.

683
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:11,638
Miss Castle offered $2.

684
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:14,515
There are things more important
than money.

685
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:18,202
- Come on, I'll buy you a beef stew.
- I hate beef stew!

686
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:31,802
Whiskey, please. Two whiskies.

687
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:38,203
- Is that mine?
- Part of it. You'll get the rest in the morning.

688
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,643
Ma'am, I'm Yukon Sam.
I got a claim worth $60,000.

689
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:44,241
Might even be worth $1 million.
Rube, ain't that right?

690
00:55:44,327 --> 00:55:47,637
It's a good claim, all right. One of the best!
Worth $50,000 or better.

691
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:49,683
You heard Rube. He only tell the truth.

692
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,564
- I'm sure he does.
- Then give me a pencil.

693
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:55,560
- I'll sign a tab for $1,000.
- No, sorry. We only play for cash.

694
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,525
- You don't trust me?
- I don't trust any man.

695
00:55:59,247 --> 00:56:02,398
Rube, buy me a drink, will you?
Go on. Give him a drink.

696
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:05,524
- Is there any particular reason?
- For not trusting men?

697
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,598
I trusted a man once.

698
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,001
That's quite a coincidence.
I trusted a woman.

699
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:13,043
Have a couple of glasses and a bottle.

700
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:16,483
Cost me a home in San Francisco,
carriages, servants.

701
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:20,915
Now ask me how a nice girl like me
got into a bad trade like this.

702
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:24,283
- What's bad about it?
- Ma'am, I got that lucky feeling.

703
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:26,927
- Sure you won't trust me?
- Very sure.

704
00:56:27,447 --> 00:56:29,165
Wanna buy my claim?

705
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,561
I'll give you $10,000.

706
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:33,399
- But it's worth $50,000.
- $10,000.

707
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:34,886
- $20,000.
- $30,000.

708
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:37,879
- $40,000.
- You just bought yourself a claim.

709
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:41,762
- Here you are.
- All right, sir.

710
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:44,156
All right. Pay the man off.

711
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:46,841
No, just give me a marker for $1,000.

712
00:56:46,927 --> 00:56:48,918
You see, I trust people.

713
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:54,007
- He'll be sorry.
- Thanks for the drink.

714
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,916
Look at this! We're in business.

715
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,801
We don't want no business.
We just want to get out.

716
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:05,562
Funny thing about gold. It don't jump
out of the ground. You gotta dig it out.

717
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:07,399
Don't worry. We're gonna dig.

718
00:57:07,487 --> 00:57:10,479
We're gonna start right now.
How much cost a couple of shovels?

719
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:12,558
- Yours are on the house.
- Good.

720
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:16,162
You owe me $20,000 in our deal.
I'll pick it up tomorrow morning.

721
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:18,158
It'll be here. Good luck.

722
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:21,842
I thought we was gonna buy that ranch
in Utah and settle down.

723
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:23,485
Here, take one.

724
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:27,005
- Never thought I'd come to this.
- Come on.

725
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:58,557
Jeff boy, we got twins!

726
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,804
Look at them.
It's just a case of knowing how.

727
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:05,117
Here, put them in the bank.

728
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:08,085
How much you figure we got now,
counting what's in the shack?

729
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:12,206
$70,000, $80,000, along with
the price of the cattle. Look at that.

730
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:17,325
Where's Tom McGrew's claim?

731
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:19,716
He's over yonder,
just the other side of the stream.

732
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:22,640
- You'll find Tom working the slew.
- Not anymore, you won't.

733
00:58:22,727 --> 00:58:24,524
Why not?
He's dead.

734
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:27,758
Dead? How'd he get dead?

735
00:58:27,887 --> 00:58:32,165
He got in a little argument
over at the Dawson Castle with lves here.

736
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:37,996
Here.

737
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:46,404
- What you shutting down for?
- I'm going hunting.

738
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:48,836
Hunting? We don't need no meat.

739
00:58:49,247 --> 00:58:52,557
Maybe not.
What we need is a way out of here.

740
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:01,762
You're wasting time.
There ain't but one way out.

741
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:04,725
- That's through Skagway.
- Not if you go along the river.

742
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,640
I met an Indian the other day, a Chilkat.

743
00:59:07,727 --> 00:59:09,524
He claims a trail all the way to Juneau.

744
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:13,043
Yeah, but did you see the trail?
I will today.

745
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:15,886
Maybe I'd better ask Rube.
He knows this country...

746
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:19,755
Now don't ask anybody!
That's the way people get killed, talking.

747
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,884
I know, but I thought
maybe Rube could help us.

748
00:59:23,087 --> 00:59:27,763
I just can't make you understand, can I?
I don't need other people. I don't need help.

749
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,724
I can take care of me.

750
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:32,245
And in a pinch...

751
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,603
I can take care of you, too.

752
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:39,564
Guess you can at that.

753
00:59:42,247 --> 00:59:44,283
Here comes Rube.
Remember what I told you.

754
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:47,404
- I won't say nothing, not a word.
- Remember that.

755
00:59:49,447 --> 00:59:51,039
You all quitting early?

756
00:59:51,127 --> 00:59:54,802
- Why don't you eat with us at Hominy's?
- And eat bear stew? No, thanks.

757
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:57,924
- I'm going hunting.
- But it's tasty the way Hominy cooks it.

758
00:59:58,007 --> 01:00:00,077
- Then there's something new.
- What's that?

759
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:02,556
- It arrived today. A piano!
- A piano?

760
01:00:02,647 --> 01:00:07,516
A piany? Why couldn't that old walrus
pack in a sheep, or pig, or goat, or...

761
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,524
You can't play a goat!

762
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:16,279
- Hi, Porcupine. Where you going?
- Home to Arizony.

763
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:19,519
I got mine. So has Tanana.

764
01:00:19,607 --> 01:00:23,282
Yeah, gonna buy me a hotel
and sit on the porch with my wife.

765
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:26,677
No working, no cooking.
Just sitting, rocking...

766
01:00:26,767 --> 01:00:30,282
and waving howdy to the neighbours
as they ride past.

767
01:00:30,447 --> 01:00:32,915
We're getting us a ranch up in Utah.

768
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:36,841
We're gonna settle down and stay put
until old Gabe blows the horn.

769
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:38,645
Ain't that for true, Jeff?

770
01:00:38,727 --> 01:00:40,718
Did you sell your claim?
Yeah.

771
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:44,163
To the Castle woman, for cash.
Then you got robbed.

772
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:48,365
We don't care on account of she's so pretty
and we're so rich.

773
01:00:50,127 --> 01:00:53,085
Be you going through Skagway?
Be there another way?

774
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:54,964
I hear tell about the river.

775
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:58,483
Yeah, but we can't swim,
and that water's so cold.

776
01:00:59,047 --> 01:01:00,719
Goodbye, Tanana.

777
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:07,520
Bye. Take care of yourself.

778
01:01:10,207 --> 01:01:13,438
I didn't say nothing, did I?
Give me my rifle.

779
01:01:21,087 --> 01:01:24,841
<i>Those flirtatious tulips</i>

780
01:01:24,927 --> 01:01:28,715
<i>Naughty tulips</i>

781
01:01:28,807 --> 01:01:32,038
<i>Whisper through the garden</i>

782
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:36,046
<i>That someone is in love</i>

783
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:40,558
<i>- The bluebells are ringing
- Hear them ring</i>

784
01:01:40,647 --> 01:01:43,923
<i>Amaryllis sigh</i>

785
01:01:44,007 --> 01:01:48,285
<i>- Sweet Williams are singing
- Hear them sing</i>

786
01:01:48,367 --> 01:01:51,404
<i>Black-eyed Susans cry</i>

787
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:55,718
<i>Pretty little primrose</i>

788
01:01:56,367 --> 01:02:00,155
<i>Dainty primrose</i>

789
01:02:00,247 --> 01:02:03,637
<i>How can you say no</i>

790
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:07,879
<i>When tulips love you so</i>

791
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:11,677
<i>How can you say no</i>

792
01:02:11,767 --> 01:02:17,717
<i>When tulips love you so</i>

793
01:02:25,447 --> 01:02:28,484
Come on, honey, you sing.
No, no more.

794
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:31,764
You'd better, else them old walruses
is gonna start bellowing again.

795
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:34,042
How are you?
I'll sing.

796
01:02:34,447 --> 01:02:36,642
Hi, Jeff. Where you been?
Hunting.

797
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:38,285
What'd you get?

798
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:52,958
Pete boy, what happened?
They jumped us in Two Mile.

799
01:02:53,287 --> 01:02:55,721
I think I got one.
And Porcupine?

800
01:02:55,927 --> 01:02:58,236
He's dead.
Whereabouts did it happen...

801
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:02,002
Stop asking fool questions.
Can't you see the man's shot full of holes?

802
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:04,362
Gimme some petticoat.
Use your own!

803
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,644
I ain't got one.
Sourdough, get me some water, will you?

804
01:03:07,727 --> 01:03:11,197
Stand back.
Let me see if I can plug up some of these.

805
01:03:15,407 --> 01:03:17,238
Never mind the water.

806
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:21,079
Take him out back, boys.
Take him outside.

807
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:32,842
You're the law up here. Why don't you
do something about them killings?

808
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:36,363
Yes, I'm the law. At least,
I represent the law in Yukon Territory.

809
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,757
- About 50,000 square miles of it.
- Why aren't there more of you?

810
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:41,838
Because yesterday this was a wilderness.

811
01:03:41,927 --> 01:03:44,316
We didn't expect you to pour in
by the thousands.

812
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:47,126
- But now that you're here, we'll protect you.
- When?

813
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:49,926
There'll be a post established
here in Dawson early in May.

814
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:53,204
What happens between now and May?
You gonna be here to keep order?

815
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,120
- Part of the time.
- What about the rest of the time?

816
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,084
Pick yourselves a good man. Swear him in.

817
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,635
Have him act as marshal
till you pull out in the fall.

818
01:04:00,727 --> 01:04:02,160
Who say we're gonna pull out?

819
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:04,920
We're gonna stay right on here
through the winter.

820
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,317
We're gonna make this a real town.
You mean permanent?

821
01:04:08,687 --> 01:04:11,520
Sure enough.
We're gonna have lampposts and sidewalks.

822
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:14,724
- Might even have ourselves a church.
- I can sing hymns.

823
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:17,196
I got a wife and kids.
Might be I move them in.

824
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:20,597
Build them a real home with a porch,
a bathtub, and everything.

825
01:04:20,687 --> 01:04:23,724
We can build a school and a courthouse.

826
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:27,163
Now, wait a minute
before you build this courthouse.

827
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,757
- Who we gonna pick as marshal?
- Who's handy with a gun?

828
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,161
He is.

829
01:04:34,567 --> 01:04:37,001
Isn't that what you told me, Ben?

830
01:04:38,287 --> 01:04:41,597
- He's really handy.
- He the one who faced up to Mr. Gannon...

831
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:43,882
and took back his cows
when they were stole?

832
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:46,720
I was with him in Two Mile Pass
when Chitina Joe got shot.

833
01:04:46,807 --> 01:04:49,640
He knocked a man out of the saddle
at better than 200 yards.

834
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:53,356
How is he up close?
He don't let them get up close.

835
01:04:54,687 --> 01:04:56,439
Well, how about it?

836
01:04:58,167 --> 01:04:59,885
I'm not interested.

837
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:03,438
Don't say you ain't interested
until you give it a little thought.

838
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:05,279
I'm not interested!

839
01:05:13,407 --> 01:05:15,318
He just ain't got no guts.

840
01:05:15,407 --> 01:05:19,116
You're wrong about him, Hominy.
He don't scare worth a nickel.

841
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,846
Maybe he don't like us.
Then we don't like him.

842
01:05:21,927 --> 01:05:25,283
We don't want no part of him.
Now who we gonna elect for marshal?

843
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:29,519
How about Rube?
Yes, Rube is the man we want.

844
01:05:33,447 --> 01:05:36,200
Ben, where'd you hide the coffee?
What?

845
01:05:36,567 --> 01:05:38,478
I found the sugar but where's the coffee?

846
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,957
I didn't hide the coffee. We're out.
We're fresh out almost.

847
01:05:42,047 --> 01:05:45,835
You'll find half a cup in that small soup can,
the one marked "salt."

848
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:47,121
That's not enough.

849
01:05:47,207 --> 01:05:49,402
It's more than enough
if you know how to make it.

850
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,763
It's getting so I gotta be the chief cook,
and the biscuit-baker...

851
01:05:52,847 --> 01:05:54,997
and everything else around here.

852
01:05:59,447 --> 01:06:00,960
- What you doing?
- I'm packing.

853
01:06:01,047 --> 01:06:04,357
- I can see you're packing, but what for?
- We're pulling out tonight.

854
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:07,086
- We can't pull...
- I should have told you before...

855
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:10,523
but I didn't want you gabbing.
I don't. We ain't pulling out...

856
01:06:10,607 --> 01:06:12,120
- on account of we can't.
- Why not?

857
01:06:12,207 --> 01:06:14,880
We made an agreement.
When Rube got elected marshal...

858
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:16,958
everyone agreed to stay the winter.
I told you.

859
01:06:17,047 --> 01:06:19,197
I didn't agree.
But I told you about it!

860
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:21,721
And I told you
Rube and all that crowd are fools.

861
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:25,880
All this talk about schools,
churches, law and order.

862
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:27,640
Law and order cost lives.

863
01:06:27,727 --> 01:06:30,195
It means somebody has to stand up
and get shot at.

864
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:32,562
That's not why I came to Dawson.

865
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:35,362
We've got ours, and we're getting out.

866
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,403
At least, I'm getting out.

867
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:43,276
You mean, you're going anyways,
even if I don't go along?

868
01:06:43,487 --> 01:06:44,806
I'm going.

869
01:06:46,247 --> 01:06:47,885
Now look, Jeff.

870
01:06:48,287 --> 01:06:52,565
You and me's been together a lot of years.
It's been good, real good.

871
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:56,556
I ain't gonna be around too much longer.
I'm getting old.

872
01:06:56,847 --> 01:07:00,681
But I sort of figured we'd go on together
until my time come.

873
01:07:01,087 --> 01:07:03,521
Come on, now, you're not that old.

874
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:05,677
I didn't talk about splitting up. It's you.

875
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:08,122
Ever since you've been talking
to Rube and Hominy...

876
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:10,926
No, it ain't only that!
You keep talking to them.

877
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:14,795
You and me seen a lot of towns get born,
cow towns and boomtowns.

878
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,037
We even put a ranch together
and watched it grow.

879
01:07:17,127 --> 01:07:19,721
Then you wanted to go
to the far country, we moved on.

880
01:07:19,807 --> 01:07:22,116
Always moving.

881
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:26,246
Thought you'd like it here with Renee,
Rube, and Hominy.

882
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:29,842
They're nice folks.
Better than any we ever met before.

883
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:36,159
All right, I'll go along,
but where's it all gonna end, boy?

884
01:07:36,247 --> 01:07:38,238
We just going on and on?

885
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:43,799
Well, maybe we'll end up
on that ranch in Utah.

886
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:47,764
Right now,
we got an awful lot of money to spend.

887
01:07:48,927 --> 01:07:51,236
What you gonna buy
that's better than what we got?

888
01:07:51,327 --> 01:07:54,524
We got friends in Dawson.
You gonna buy new ones?

889
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,916
Come on, let's get that coffee.

890
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:12,845
Sounds like Miss Castle
got a new piany.

891
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:15,278
Sounds like she got a lot of things.

892
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,835
Let's get the coffee
over in the Hash House.

893
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,919
We can get the coffee right in here.
Come on.

894
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:37,085
Hello, Jeff!

895
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,681
Ronda tells me
you and Ben been doing real good.

896
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:41,598
We ain't complaining.

897
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:47,959
I hope you got enough to pay what you owe
the government. It's a tidy sum.

898
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:49,765
Did you come up to collect?

899
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:54,125
No. Yukon ain't under my jurisdiction,
I'm sorry to say.

900
01:08:54,287 --> 01:08:57,996
However, I'll hang you when you come
through Skagway in the fall.

901
01:08:58,087 --> 01:09:00,601
Ain't no hurry.
No, that can wait.

902
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:05,756
I'd like to get some coffee,
2 pounds of coffee.

903
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:08,919
- That ain't enough.
- Then we can come in and buy more.

904
01:09:09,007 --> 01:09:10,838
- Come in?
- You've been waiting to dance.

905
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:14,442
- Try your luck with Goldilocks.
- Me dance? This is ridiculous.

906
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:17,803
- Do you drink in the daytime?
- Sure, if it's good whiskey.

907
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:21,243
- Will you join me?
- Thanks, Jeff. Yeah, I will.

908
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,959
I suppose you're wondering
what I'm doing up here in Dawson.

909
01:09:25,047 --> 01:09:26,878
That's your business.

910
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:29,682
I knew I was gonna like you.

911
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,926
I'm gonna stake me a claim,
maybe two or three.

912
01:09:33,007 --> 01:09:35,999
Skagway's paying out.
Could be I'll settle here permanent.

913
01:09:36,087 --> 01:09:39,602
Dawson's gonna like that.
How about that coffee?

914
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,197
Who all's name is Burt Madden?

915
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:46,719
My name's Madden.

916
01:09:49,607 --> 01:09:52,963
This notice for filing a claim,
did you write it?

917
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:55,519
Yeah, I wrote it.

918
01:09:56,367 --> 01:10:00,360
That's my claim. The markers have been up
for over three months.

919
01:10:00,887 --> 01:10:03,321
I figure maybe you made a mistake?

920
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:07,846
Pick it up.

921
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:11,485
Then put it back where you found it.

922
01:10:11,567 --> 01:10:14,877
I tell you, that's my claim.
I said, pick it up.

923
01:10:33,207 --> 01:10:36,279
Dusty never shot a gun.
He didn't know how.

924
01:10:36,887 --> 01:10:39,355
Chances is, it wasn't even loaded.

925
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:43,440
Was I supposed to know that?
No, you weren't supposed to know.

926
01:10:46,607 --> 01:10:48,438
And I want that coffee ground.

927
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:50,199
Take him outside.

928
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:56,878
What's going on here?

929
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:59,606
Looks like you got
a killing on your hands, Rube.

930
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:03,236
I understand you're the marshal.
Who done the killing?

931
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:06,201
I did.

932
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,644
Gonna lock him up?

933
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:13,038
We ain't got no jail yet.

934
01:11:13,487 --> 01:11:17,162
But I'll take your guns
and work out a fair trial for you.

935
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:20,284
You'll take my guns?

936
01:11:27,647 --> 01:11:28,841
Take them.

937
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:32,840
- Go on, Marshal, take them!
- Give them to me. I like guns.

938
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:36,161
Don't be afraid.
He won't bite you.

939
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:40,602
Just unfasten your gun belt.

940
01:11:42,607 --> 01:11:44,199
You unfasten it.

941
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:54,116
Hold on, Rube.

942
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:58,758
There isn't any reason for a man
getting himself killed, if he doesn't have to.

943
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:03,403
- Isn't that right, Mr. Gannon?
- That's a point. Good point.

944
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:09,916
Why don't you go back to the nice people
before you get hurt?

945
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:15,357
I didn't expect that from you.

946
01:12:22,927 --> 01:12:25,725
You shamed him.
Rube would rather be dead.

947
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:27,479
But he's not dead.

948
01:12:30,047 --> 01:12:32,083
I ain't fit to wear this.

949
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,359
It just ain't right.

950
01:12:43,887 --> 01:12:47,163
What they gonna do now?
Yukon can't stand up to Mr. Gannon.

951
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:49,681
If they have sense,
they'll leave town while they can.

952
01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:52,406
Yeah, but they was gonna build a town.

953
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:57,360
I guess maybe you're right.
Maybe it ain't none of our business.

954
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:09,203
You sure this back trail
takes us to Juneau?

955
01:13:09,287 --> 01:13:10,845
As far as the river.

956
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:14,602
Then we get on a little old raft?
Always the long way.

957
01:13:16,007 --> 01:13:18,202
You know I don't like boats.

958
01:13:46,007 --> 01:13:48,123
This is the raft you built?

959
01:13:48,807 --> 01:13:51,002
Get these branches off here.

960
01:13:51,647 --> 01:13:55,435
Sure hope it floats.
She'll float all right. I tried her.

961
01:13:57,407 --> 01:14:01,798
What we gonna do with the horses?
Pull the saddles and turn them loose.

962
01:14:01,887 --> 01:14:03,684
There's lots of good grazing here.

963
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:06,679
Why don't we leave the boat here
and ride down to Skagway?

964
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:09,645
We wouldn't have no trouble
while Mr. Gannon's in Dawson.

965
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:13,117
That's just what he wants us to do.
Then they'd jump us at Two Mile Pass.

966
01:14:13,207 --> 01:14:16,279
Untie that rope,
and we'll ease her down into the water.

967
01:14:16,367 --> 01:14:20,599
- What do you do, just pull it?
- Just pull it. Come on now, ease her down.

968
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:23,440
Ease your line down. There she goes.

969
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:26,922
There.

970
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:29,999
Did you bring the bacon and the flour?
I brung it all.

971
01:14:30,087 --> 01:14:32,203
We should have brought
a lot more, too.

972
01:14:32,287 --> 01:14:36,326
It's gonna be a long walk
after we leave the river, and I like to eat.

973
01:14:36,767 --> 01:14:39,804
What would you rather do,
carry gold or bacon?

974
01:14:41,527 --> 01:14:44,280
Here's something you can carry,
two more pounds of coffee.

975
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:46,597
I can starve a little,
but I can't go without coffee.

976
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,121
Where'd you get those?
We only had 2 pounds...

977
01:14:49,207 --> 01:14:51,516
so I went to the store yesterday,
got a couple more.

978
01:14:51,607 --> 01:14:53,359
- Ben, didn't l...
- I didn't say nothing.

979
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,723
- Are you sure you didn't say any...
- Honest, Jeff, I didn't.

980
01:14:56,807 --> 01:15:00,243
Now get these horses unloaded.
Let's get out of here.

981
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:06,206
I didn't mean to do no wrong, Jeff.
I just love my coffee.

982
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:10,639
When we have our place in Utah,
I'm gonna have coffee every blessed hour...

983
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:48,877
And you told me he was dead.

984
01:16:49,447 --> 01:16:53,042
- I told you to leave that man alone.
- You've been doing too much telling.

985
01:16:53,127 --> 01:16:55,721
From now on, you're gonna listen to me.

986
01:16:55,807 --> 01:16:58,799
I'm getting tired of listening to that bell.

987
01:16:59,647 --> 01:17:01,683
- I'll go turn it off.
- No.

988
01:17:02,287 --> 01:17:03,686
He'll keep.

989
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:10,276
- He wouldn't thank you.
- But somebody's got to help him.

990
01:17:10,687 --> 01:17:12,757
Come on, Rube. Wake up!

991
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:37,925
No, don't move your hand.

992
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:40,397
Don't move your shoulder, either.

993
01:17:40,647 --> 01:17:43,798
The muscle is torn up
but the bone is all right.

994
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:47,886
What, your dad
want you to be a doctor, too?

995
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:50,197
He taught me a lot of things.

996
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:57,802
- What about Ben? I tried to dig a...
- I took care of him.

997
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:01,080
I also made some coffee and some stew.

998
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:03,962
What made you come out here?

999
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:06,518
Someone has to help you.

1000
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:08,562
Why?

1001
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:13,360
That's a silly question. You've got
to help people when they need help.

1002
01:18:13,447 --> 01:18:16,917
<i>What kind of a world will it be
if everybody was like...</i>

1003
01:18:17,207 --> 01:18:18,481
Like me?

1004
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:21,120
Open your mouth.

1005
01:18:26,247 --> 01:18:29,683
- Is that what you were gonna say?
- Now, we don't talk.

1006
01:18:30,007 --> 01:18:33,966
We just eat and we sleep.
Then we get well and strong again.

1007
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:36,644
You think I was wrong?

1008
01:18:39,207 --> 01:18:40,560
Don't you?

1009
01:18:41,487 --> 01:18:43,921
Say it. Go on, say what you're thinking.

1010
01:18:44,007 --> 01:18:47,522
We don't talk. We just eat and sleep.

1011
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,157
I think she's right, Jeff.

1012
01:18:52,887 --> 01:18:55,401
How do you like your coffee? Black?

1013
01:18:55,807 --> 01:18:58,719
The coffee come after the soup.
I'll wait.

1014
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:01,283
Nobody asked you to wait.

1015
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:08,595
Ask me.

1016
01:19:14,287 --> 01:19:17,962
Yeah, I want her to stay.
Thanks for everything, Renee.

1017
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:22,926
Don't thank me. Thank her!

1018
01:19:26,007 --> 01:19:27,884
- What caused that?
- Jealousy.

1019
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:31,926
- Jealousy? She's only a child...
- She's a woman, so am I. Coffee?

1020
01:19:32,127 --> 01:19:34,277
No, I don't want any coffee.

1021
01:19:34,807 --> 01:19:37,799
What about the 2 pounds
Ben came in to buy?

1022
01:19:38,327 --> 01:19:40,283
Did you sell it to him?

1023
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:42,967
I liked Ben.
Did you sell it to him?

1024
01:19:43,047 --> 01:19:45,766
If I had, he would have been alive today.

1025
01:19:45,967 --> 01:19:48,606
But you're right about Ben.
He talked too much.

1026
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:52,077
Gannon and the others listened.
I learned that tonight.

1027
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,566
Mr. Gannon.

1028
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,566
Just wait till my hand gets better.

1029
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:02,798
That's exactly what he wants you to do.
Ben's dead.

1030
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:06,641
Getting killed or killing Gannon
isn't gonna bring him back.

1031
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:11,759
Look, I'm pulling out,
and you're going with me.

1032
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:14,484
We do well together.

1033
01:20:21,647 --> 01:20:23,160
Think it over?

1034
01:21:55,687 --> 01:21:58,599
- Having trouble?
- And if I am?

1035
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:02,839
Maybe I can help you.
I don't want your help.

1036
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:04,686
Where's Rube?

1037
01:22:04,767 --> 01:22:07,565
Where you put him: at the Dawson Castle.

1038
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:17,757
Marshal, your bottle's empty again.
Here, have a fresh one.

1039
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:22,407
Mr. Gannon,
the citizens seem to be unhappy.

1040
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:24,876
What did you re-stake my claim for?

1041
01:22:25,647 --> 01:22:27,842
Your claim?
Yeah, my claim.

1042
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:31,317
That fellow, lves,
he took down my markers...

1043
01:22:31,407 --> 01:22:33,796
and put up this piece of paper
with your name on it.

1044
01:22:33,887 --> 01:22:37,800
- He did the same with mine, too.
- Is this your name, Mr. Gannon?

1045
01:22:38,647 --> 01:22:43,038
Yes, that's my name. I'd advise you
to put that back where you found it.

1046
01:22:43,327 --> 01:22:46,524
I will not. Rube and I staked that claim.

1047
01:22:46,887 --> 01:22:48,559
It belongs to us.

1048
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:52,837
- Isn't that true, Rube?
- What difference does it make?

1049
01:22:53,607 --> 01:22:54,881
You can't lick them anyhow.

1050
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:58,198
I don't care what Rube said.
I see him stake that claim last year.

1051
01:22:58,287 --> 01:23:01,120
And did you see him
file a notice of that claim in Ottawa?

1052
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:03,277
That's the proper place to file a claim.

1053
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:06,962
We're gonna have a claim office
here in Dawson soon as the Mounties come.

1054
01:23:07,047 --> 01:23:10,039
We're gonna have a courthouse
and everything, come the spring.

1055
01:23:10,127 --> 01:23:11,924
<i>Then we'll file our claims.</i>

1056
01:23:12,007 --> 01:23:15,283
That's very interesting.
Only, don't file any of my claims.

1057
01:23:15,367 --> 01:23:19,440
And that's what you're holding
in your hands right now: my claims.

1058
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:22,446
You're not gonna get away with it,
Mr. Gannon.

1059
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:25,724
But I already have, Marshal.
It's finished, done.

1060
01:23:27,047 --> 01:23:28,958
Then it's up to me to undo it!

1061
01:23:33,527 --> 01:23:35,597
You're real slow, Marshal.

1062
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:39,526
Now get out, and take that with you.

1063
01:23:48,687 --> 01:23:50,200
Come on, Rube.

1064
01:24:02,727 --> 01:24:05,195
Give me a gun!
He ain't gonna get away with this!

1065
01:24:05,287 --> 01:24:07,517
I won't let you do it, Yukon.

1066
01:24:09,807 --> 01:24:14,005
Ain't no sense in a man
letting himself get killed if he don't have to.

1067
01:24:16,847 --> 01:24:18,838
Ain't that what you said?

1068
01:24:24,527 --> 01:24:26,199
And another thing.

1069
01:24:26,807 --> 01:24:29,640
If you're wise, you'll get out of Dawson.

1070
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:32,124
Don't you agree, Jeff?

1071
01:24:39,847 --> 01:24:41,075
Can I lend you a gun?

1072
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:44,159
Yes, if you can lend him an arm
to go with it.

1073
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:47,764
I warned you. Where there's gold,
there's stealing and killing.

1074
01:24:47,847 --> 01:24:52,045
Like he said, we gotta get out of town.
Let's talk it over first.

1075
01:24:52,647 --> 01:24:56,003
Now do you understand
why I wanted us to get out of Dawson?

1076
01:24:56,087 --> 01:24:59,045
I'm beginning to understand a lot of things.

1077
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:02,676
In the meantime, we're not gonna
do anything foolish, are we?

1078
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:04,359
We aren't?

1079
01:25:04,447 --> 01:25:07,644
A little, perhaps. Like trusting one another.

1080
01:25:09,047 --> 01:25:12,483
But that's the way it goes
when a woman falls in love.

1081
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:15,877
I'm in love with you, Jeff.

1082
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:32,643
Get your packs made up.
Take your belongings, gold, and everything.

1083
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,922
Get back here as fast as you can.

1084
01:25:35,007 --> 01:25:37,362
Are you all just gonna pull out?

1085
01:25:38,607 --> 01:25:42,282
What about that courthouse, school,
and church you were talking about?

1086
01:25:42,367 --> 01:25:44,119
Who are you to ask?

1087
01:26:37,927 --> 01:26:39,679
I wouldn't do that.

1088
01:26:41,927 --> 01:26:45,124
Everyone is pulling out.
We figured your claim was abandoned.

1089
01:26:45,207 --> 01:26:46,526
It isn't.

1090
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:50,925
- Mr. Gannon ain't gonna like this.
- You tell Mr. Gannon I'll be in to see him.

1091
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:53,845
He'll be waiting.

1092
01:27:41,527 --> 01:27:43,438
I told him you'd be waiting.

1093
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:47,237
I always knew
he'd turn into a public-minded citizen.

1094
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,837
Let's have a little quiet!

1095
01:27:56,407 --> 01:27:59,285
It seems a gentleman's coming to visit us.

1096
01:28:07,527 --> 01:28:09,995
In fact, he seems to have arrived.

1097
01:28:11,007 --> 01:28:13,646
<i>Do you still want to quiet that bell?</i>

1098
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:15,561
Why not?

1099
01:29:08,687 --> 01:29:09,915
Madden!

1100
01:29:33,887 --> 01:29:35,115
Mr. Gannon!

1101
01:29:41,087 --> 01:29:43,203
I knew Madden couldn't take him.

1102
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,964
I'll be right with you, Jeff!

1103
01:29:53,047 --> 01:29:55,277
You'll know when to come out.

1104
01:30:17,887 --> 01:30:19,525
Jeff, look out!

1105
01:30:28,847 --> 01:30:31,998
You crazy fool!
Why didn't you take care of you?

1106
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:35,083
That's a funny question.

1107
01:31:21,487 --> 01:31:24,001
All right! Get out or fight!

1108
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:33,878
We can't fight the whole town.

1109
01:31:33,967 --> 01:31:37,198
Show them the trail, Yukon.
And put on your badge.

1110
01:31:43,927 --> 01:31:48,205
Right out yonder's the trail,
and don't ever come into our town again!

1111
01:32:00,127 --> 01:32:02,436
You went and got yourself hurt again.

1112
01:32:02,527 --> 01:32:06,725
I know. We eat, we sleep, we rest,
and soon we'll be all better again.
