3
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:38,346
RIO CONCHOS

5
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:49,185
Stand up, mister!

6
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:54,816
-You are in my land. Get off!
-I said stand up!

7
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:58,778
You know, I figured just sitting here
in my own parlor resting a spell, so

8
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:01,114
..why don't you take you little boys in blue
a go along?

9
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:03,616
-Sergeant, give me that rifle.

10
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:06,619
Help yourself.

11
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:12,667
Where did you get this?
I said, where did you get it?

12
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:24,512
-Captain, that in none of your damned yankee business!
-What kind of a rebel butcher are you?

13
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:26,514
Well, now..

14
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:30,435
Do you blue bellies got a
law against killing Apaches?

15
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,605
Get up on your feet!

16
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:44,490
It's a long ride to Fort
Davis. Get your saddle.

17
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:51,330
You can walk or ride, it's your choice.
Either way you are going with me.

18
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:34,540
Was it Blood Shirts people you butchered up there?
They were Apaches.

19
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:42,256
Where did you get this gun?

20
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:46,969
Colonel, I've already gave your pup
my answer, to that, now do you wanna direct...

21
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:51,557
Now, this is important! It's more important than your
private honor, your private war.

22
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:57,438
-Now, where did you get the gun?
-Well, Colonel. If you are so interested in that gun..
why don't you just keep it?

23
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:02,568
-And I will be going
-Do it, and I'll blow the top of your head off!

24
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:09,534
-Pfff.. Go ahead!
-Major Lassiter! Have you gone completely mad?
-Major?

25
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:13,079
Well don't let that stop you! I was
in the Confederate Army.

26
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:18,501
-How can anyone get to you?'How do I get into the persets guts of yours?
-You don't.

27
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,383
Oh, I guess not. Massacring and
burials parties proves it


28
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:27,635
Colonel...

29
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,265
You are an old man.

30
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:36,602
Yes, but still a man, not a
blood craved butcher!

31
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,439
Lassiter,

32
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:45,361
... it's been almost a year since
your wife and your daughter... No no, you listen

33
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:50,908
Don't you think I know what it means
to a man come home and find his wife and child dead?

34
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:56,873
Dead?

35
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,334
All right.

36
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:04,172
Tortured, and then...
But it's been almost a year.

37
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:07,759
Your are not looking for revenge against
Blood Shirt anymore.

38
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:12,430
Your are using that as an excuse to go on killling!
But I am gonna stop you.

39
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,809
Colonel...

40
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:20,396
What are you gonna charge me with?

41
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:24,400
You are an animal An animal that belongs
in a cage.

42
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:30,740
Now, either you tell us were and from whom you got that gun
or I'm gonna put you in the guard house until you rot!

43
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:36,871
-Now, where did you get it?
-Well I guess you do want it direct..

44
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:44,212
-My answer is still, it's none of your damned yankee business
-Sergeant, lock him up.

45
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:49,008
The charges is possession of
stolen government property.

46
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:53,262
Yes..sir

47
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,018
Colonel!

48
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,740
-You are not going to get anything out og that
drink sodden rebel
-Maybe not.

49
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:17,370
Well, what do we do now?
Do we just sit around here and wait?

50
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:21,791
-Do you have a better ideas, Captain?
-Yes sir.

51
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,295
The time has been running out on us.
I scoured all over Texes...

52
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:29,757
..and I've come up with one gun out of that
whole shipment.

53
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:33,886
-The rest of them must be down there in Mexico by now.
-Well, that is out of the question.

54
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:38,266
If any of our troops crossed the border,
Mexico would be justified to declare war.

55
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:42,729
I did not mean to send the whole army
down there. No sir. Just two men.

56
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:47,066
-Sergeant Franklyn and of myself.. out of uniform
-Out of uniform?

57
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:52,280
-And how do you intend to find the guns?
-Bait. Gun powder, a whole waggon load

58
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:57,535
Once we get down there, and if we can't
brings those guns back..we'll destroy them.

59
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:02,123
And how do I explain to Washington
that the officer who lost those guns are...

60
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,878
....now roaming Mexico trying to hand over
a waggon load of unpowder? Forget it!

61
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:10,298
Yes, sir!

62
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:56,469
Muchos gracias  Listen, you take that, huh?.
You eat it. It's good porridge for you.

63
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:08,106
Oh. I have interrupted your sleep. I am very sorry.

64
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:12,902
Permit me to offer my apologies by
offering you a drink.

65
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:25,081
Bad whiskey, huh? And I've just traded my
fathers watch for it.

66
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:28,251
-You were cheated.
-Perhaps not.

67
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:31,921
They say it is a lucky kid that
knows his own father.

68
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:36,050
-Permit me. I am Juan Luis Rodriguez.
-Are you sure?

69
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:43,391
-Last time it was Martinez.
-Lassiter?

70
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:51,107
-But it is impossible! Is it you, amigo? Alive and the same?
-Do you think I'm a ghost?

71
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,280
From what one hears certain indians wants to think
that Lassiter is an evil spirit.

72
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:01,409
You trade with Apaches now?

73
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:05,955
-If a man buys himself he can not 
always choose his customers.

74
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:09,625
Hey Amigo.. when I was Martinez, do you remenber?

75
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:15,131
3 card money and a cold deck.

76
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:19,552
Oh, how a man gets his money does not matter
It is how he spends it, Amigo.

77
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:24,515
Martinez was a king, remember...
the french girl, remember?

79
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,942
You now she was of noble blood that one.
Had I married with her, amigo...

80
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:40,198
-One little mistake, thats all.
-Some little mistake..

81
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:45,328
-You shot Maximilian's military attache.
-You see, they were his pistols.

82
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:50,041
-The duel was fair, amigo
-When a man shoots the way you do, that's murder.

83
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,169
Hey what is going on there?

84
00:11:56,506 --> 00:12:00,635
Compadre. What we talked about that is all
in the past.

85
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:05,139
Two old friends like us we meet
in such a place like this, huh?

86
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:09,727
-You're in bad trouble, amigo?
-No. Nothing.
-Same with me

87
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:13,314
Well who's all that for?

88
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,025
Well that? For me.

89
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:21,781
Well, I did'nt know they could hang
you for trading with Apaches.

90
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:25,451
Oh no, they say it's for fighting.
And thas is unjust.

91
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:30,164
-The soldier had a gun, I had only a knife.. that's all
-And the soldier had a wife?

92
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:34,460
Amigo.. such a wife!
Ah.. but I have always been unlucky.

93
00:12:34,627 --> 00:12:40,550
Locked up here I can not even 
console the poor widow. What a shame!

94
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:18,880
More people come to the fort every day.
I will have a large audience for my hanging.

95
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:26,346
I'm going to die  but it is you I pity, amigo

96
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:32,352
You'll go loco in this place. The gringos
commands is wise.

97
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:38,066
You know how easy it would be to die.

98
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:43,237
Hey.. Perhaps if you talked to him we could change places


99
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:47,200
-He's a fool
-Si.
-And you're a fool.

100
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:56,584
Well, I've been here long enough
Hey, you blue donkey!

101
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:02,215
I want to see the colonel.

102
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:07,887
Adios, amigo!

103
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:37,667
-Now, what is so important about this gun?
-On February 10th, six escorted waggons

104
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,629
..left the arsenal of St. Louis.

105
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:47,802
-On March 1st they were ambushed and the waggons stolen
-Even against the Indians.

106
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:51,347
the quality of Yankee troops have not improved.


107
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:56,227
They were ambushed by white men. The waggons
carried 2,000 new repeating rifles

108
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,355
Yours are the first one to turn up.

109
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,071
-Well Colconel. I bought a gun in Presidio.
-You bought it? Who from?

110
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:16,581
Lassiter, this command contains 300 men.

111
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:21,961
What do you thing what happens when we are faced with
2000 apces armed with better weapons than we have?

112
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:26,966
What do think it mean to those families out there?
The women, children...

113
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:33,222
Well, Colonel...

114
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:38,061
Tha mans name is Theron Pardee.

115
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:44,609
Pardee? One of Bedford Forrest guerilla raiders?

116
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:48,863
The galant leader of the southern cavalry
and my last command and officer.

117
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,907
Is he still in Presidio?

118
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,828
-Sir, that was over a month ago.
He could be just about any place.

119
00:15:56,204 --> 00:16:00,792
-Could he be across the border... in Chihuahua? 
-Who knows?

120
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:04,921
-But you could find him?
-Now, why do I wanna do that?

121
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,096
You memory of your wife and daughter.

122
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:20,645
Or because it is your only way out of here

123
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:29,237
-Well, Colonel. If I could find Pardee? What then?
-Go on home, wherever you want.

124
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,864
Captain Haven will take over from there.

125
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,159
Captain Haven?

126
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,663
-Just the two of us?
-You will have his sergeant along.

127
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:44,168
-Oh I see. That Yankee and his black and me.
Colonel, I don't wanna hurt anybodys feelings,

128
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:50,633
..but what's to prevent me to get a bullet in the back
of my head about one second after I point him to Pardee?

129
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,763
-The captain will be under orders.
-I'm sorry sir, but that's just not good enough.

130
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,976
-I want my man of my own along.
-Who?

131
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:07,316
-Rodriguez.
-Rodriguez? That cut throat breed
sitting in the guard house?

132
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:12,572
-He knows the country a well as I do
and speaks the language better.
-He is gonna be tried and hung for murder.

133
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,326
Thats why I know he'll volunteer. Now Colonel... It's gonna
be that or nothing!

134
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:21,330
-You're not going to saddle me with this and that...
-Do you want to undertake this mission, Captain?

135
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:27,045
-Well, you know that, Colonel
-Then I say in the time we probably have left he is the
only chance slim as it may be.

136
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:32,550
But if you prefer not to go, there are other officers
I can ask to volunteer.

137
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:36,721
-That won't be necessary, Colonel
-All right.

138
00:17:39,807 --> 00:17:43,770
You'll give me your word you will get them there?

139
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:47,523
-My word?
-That's right.

140
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:55,698
Well Colonel. For  whatever it's worth..
..you can have it.

141
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:18,596
-hey, Lassiter!
-Yes sir, Captain!

142
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:28,106
You said it would be water.
Where is it? We've been riding all night.

143
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:33,569
Well I thought time was important
Are you tired, Captain?

144
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,198
No.. I've been thinking about the horses.

145
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:42,286
Well there will be water for them up ahead.

146
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:45,748
-Well, let's get going
-Yes, sir !

147
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:49,836
-Anything else, Captain?
-No.

148
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:04,559
-There is no water here for at least a full days ride
-You know it..and I know it

149
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,521
I see.

150
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,860
The waggon is carrying omething valuable
that must be in Mexico pronto, heh?

151
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:18,781
Friend, the only other thing you'll have to know
is that the farther we get from that fort,
the farther you are from a rope


152
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:22,994
Si..and for that I'm in your debt, compadre.

153
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:27,040
Si. Forever.

154
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,767
Ahhh that's better. Much better.

155
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:54,192
Por favor? Sigarette?

156
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:57,362
Gracias.

157
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,241
Lassiter, mi amigo, I need your help. tell me something.

158
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,162
To you..how old do you think I look? hmm?


159
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:12,877
-How old do you think I look?
-What difference does it make?
-To me it is very important. How old?

160
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,797
What old do you think?

161
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:21,886
Ahh maybe I think I look about...just ehh, 25?.

162
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,724
-Do you agree?
-Guess again.
-30?

163
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,269
More?

164
00:20:31,145 --> 00:20:32,855
Ay carraco!

165
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:37,902
But you did not take into consideracion that
I have had not sleep for two days.

166
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:41,030
That shows on a man.

167
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:47,954
-Yes sir! It sure does
-Por Dios!

168
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,338
Permizzo, heh?

169
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,969
Are we going to eat?

170
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:06,264
-Put it out
-Huh?
-The match. Put it out!

171
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:09,267
-Si! Perdone, Capitane.

172
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:19,318
Bueno. I'm very hungry.
Can I help you?

173
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,952
Ahh.. that smells so delicioso.

174
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:39,797
-That's it. Vamonos.
-Si, Capitane, Si.

175
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,154
-Put your into it you skunks!
-Que paso?
-We've got ourselves some trouble. Bandidos!

176
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:50,284
-Bandidos? Are they many?
-Six I saw for sure.

177
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:55,123
-Now get those mules moving
-Where are the rifles?
-Under the seat.

178
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,508
I have no weapons.

179
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:10,263
Give me something. You are my friend.

180
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,983
Bueno diaz!

181
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:35,079
Bueno diaz, amigos

182
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,583
Hi there. Good day to you.

183
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:43,504
Where are you and your frineds going?

184
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:48,134
Well sir. We were headed for Presidio, but
I think we've got ourselves lost.

185
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:53,056
-Maybe you can put us on the
right track?
-Maybe

186
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:57,393
-We would be much abliged.
-Oh. sure..sure.

187
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:04,567
-How long afar did you come?
-All the way out from Rosewell.

188
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:11,032
Well now. Where did they come from?

189
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:15,203
Poof! Just like that.

190
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:21,125
-Big surprise, no?
-Yes, it is!

191
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:27,298
Look! There's more. More poof!

192
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,811
More surprise, huh?

193
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:48,486
-Big surprise.
-Well poof... and five men!

194
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:54,409
Gringo, ole, ole, and poof!

195
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:58,204
( How are you?
-We're good. )

196
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:04,377
( Medaljon! nice.
-Leave him alone, man. )

197
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:10,049
( I will, but it is beautiful. )

198
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,664
Mucho gun!

199
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:47,295
-Yes sir Have you seen one like that before?
-No..never.

200
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,381
Well it's brand spanking new.

201
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:58,890
-Too much bullets? You know,
bang-bang -bang. too much?
-That's right.

202
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:03,061
It is a good gun. Hey, let me show you.

203
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,938
Gringo, I don't think...

204
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:22,872
Gracias.

205
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,545
Friend of yours?

206
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:16,759
-He is number 6
-Let's take a look and see
how many more friends you got around.

207
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,805
You first.

208
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:39,073
Apache! Rodriguez, 

209
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,209
Hold it! You led us right into this trap.

210
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:54,130
Would now would it have been better if went
around and have them sitting up there taking
pot shot at our waggon...

211
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,675
..load of gunpowder?

212
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,014
Why didn't you shoot this man while you had a chance?
If I saw him number 6 up here so did you.

213
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,850
Drop it!

214
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,396
He's got parts of the same uniform as you have.

215
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:14,275
And that's second stolen
repeater we've come across.

216
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:19,155
I came from the same place, Pardee..
who is now going to be hard as hell to find

217
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:24,535
..because you were so trigger happy down there
I told you not to move until I did!

218
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:28,581
Of course I saw him up here.
I was looking for a deal!

219
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:32,835
He is one of Pardee'smen and he could have
taken us to him.... You!

220
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:42,595
What I wanna know from her is how they found out
How come they were weaiting for us?

221
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:46,349
Come on!

222
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,148
I don't think this one will talk.

223
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:57,527
-No? Give me the knife.
-What knife? I have no knife.

224
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:02,365
-I lost there in the fight below.
-Look in your shirt 
-My shirt?

225
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:06,661
Si? I forgot.
I am sorry, amigo.

226
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:17,422
Now you tell her that I will split her nose
So everyone can see...

227
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:20,675
...how she dirties herself with the white man.

228
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:37,025
She said it did not matter since
we will all die very soon.

229
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:41,863
In three suns time all the clans of the Apache
will gather to be given great new medicine.

230
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:47,326
-She must mean the trade. You ask her where
it is going to take place.
-Who cares?

231
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,872
-What does it got to do with me?
-Everything.

232
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,542
The Apache has been raiding further
south than ever before


233
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:59,672
They are not interested in picking up any live stock
What they are looking for are gold and jewels.

234
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:05,970
It's gonna be a trade allright. And if we know
when and where, we can be there to stop it.

235
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,475
So you can be there. All I
gotta do is to find Pardee.

236
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:16,522
-Maybe you can't. Or won't.
-Wait and you'll see. Lets go!

237
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,318
Well, what about her?
-Shoot it.

238
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:26,407
-Better yet.Save the bullet.
-Nobody is touching that girl

239
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:30,119
-She's going with us.
-Like Hell hew is!

240
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:34,749
You are not giving any order
While you're looking Pardee,

241
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:38,920
..she just might remember where
will be trade is going to take place.

242
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,757
What harm can she do this little Indian, heh?

243
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,721
-Tell her she is going with us.
-Si. Capitane si.

244
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,697
-Hey Captain, two of them are Indians.
-Rodriguez? Apaches?

245
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,326
Membrano clan. And that one too.

246
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,584
Rodriguez.

247
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,340
Can you read that?

248
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,805
No

249
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:36,477
-If you are parallel to the Rio Grande, 
they are too.

250
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:41,315
Apache and Pardee people are already working together.

251
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,610
Sergeant, are these mules ready to move?

252
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,990
-As soon as we bury these men.
-Who says you were?
-There isn't time.

253
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:54,245
-What about the guns, Captain?
-Put them on the waggon.
-But hey, Capitane., I have no weapon.. only,

254
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,416
-..this little knife 
-You do not need no weapons. And you don't need this.

255
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:02,795
Franklyn, put her
on the waggon too.

256
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:08,968
Tell her not to have nothing to be afraid of
as long as she does as she is told.

257
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,807
She might believe you more if you
gave her something to eat.

258
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,319
You! You opened this last night, huh?

259
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:31,199
The fuse is gone.
What did you do with it?

260
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:35,286
-Lower the gun, senor.
-What did you do with it?

261
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,790
-It is there. La Reata !

262
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,086
-The lariot!
-Si.

263
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,046
Vieda.

264
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,888
I wove it during the night thinking of hiding it for you
better that way

265
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,266
When a man sets out oin what may be he last ride,

266
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:00,520
he should go with people he could trust.

267
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:07,026
-I'll take the gun me and Lassiter.
-No gun for you. You mount up.

268
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,703
Well the reasons for staying with this detail
are getting less and less.

269
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:22,875
-Just try leaving it
-Whoo Captain. You wouldn't shoot an
unarmed man?

270
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,129
You try me.

271
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,401
I'll see how deep it is.

272
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,346
-The water would build on top of the waggon before we
get to the middle.
-I know.

273
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,682
The Major and I told you so, heh?.

274
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,811
Si and the water is low as here for 100 miles.

275
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,481
We will move on to Presidio.

276
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,735
But capitane. You can't just take the waggon across,
can you? How?

277
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:36,240
-There is a ferry in Presidio isn't there?
-Yes sir, Captain.

278
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:19,158
There you are, Captain. There is your ferry.
Now all you gotta do is to ride down..

279
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,121
...tell those Texas Rangers
that you have a waggon full of gunpowder...

280
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,375
...that you want to get to the other side so you
can trade with the Apaches.

281
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,462
-Bueno tardes, senorita.
-Bueno tardes

282
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,757
You got any other bright ideas?

283
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:40,013
You know I have, but you know something.. I can't remember
one of them without my rifle.

284
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,437
Franklyn, let me have  Lassiter's rifle.

285
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:52,150
First thing we do.. is to see what we
can find out about Pardee.

286
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:57,447
You, and him and me. We'll ride up there
get us a drink and look around.

287
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:03,119
-And leave him with the waggon?
-Yes sir. And he'll need a rifle too.

288
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,748
Franklyn stays with the waggon.

289
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:11,794
Now what is Franklyn gonna do with the waggon
when he gets it across? If he gets it across.

290
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:17,925
-Do you know where the Split Mountain is next to the swamp?
-No
-Well Captain. Rodriguez does.

291
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:26,768
-How do I know that we won't desert us?
-Capitane, what are you saying?

292
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:31,522
-Rodriguez is my man. He wouldn't desert me
-Si, amigo !

293
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:36,694
You and I we will be...
... side by side. Shall we go, Captain?

294
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,283
Have fun, amigos.

295
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,750
-There is a loaded rifle under the seat.
-Thank you very much.

296
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:18,236
Savage is impossible.
Just wasting my time.

297
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,602
On the red!

298
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:57,650
-Pardee been in yet?
-Who?
-Theron Pardee.

299
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:01,988
-Sometimes calls himself Colonel.
-I've never heard of him.

300
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,284
-16 on the red.
-Let it ride!

301
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,791
( How are you, darling?
-Good. )

302
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:17,295
( As my friend Pardee?)

303
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,800
( I do not understand. )

304
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,724
-Ahhh. you ibuy me drink?
-In a little while.

305
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,937
Five ! red again. All bets down or your're out.

306
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,400
One more time. Where is Al?

307
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:46,199
Al, you say?
-The man who owns this place?
-I own this place.

308
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:51,162
-And so far mister. I don't know what you are talking about
-Well Al does

309
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:58,002
-Maybe that's why he died 
-You don't say. I didn't even know he was feeling poorly


310
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:04,592
23, red again.
You got $ 40 on the red, what is your pleasure?

311
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,264
One more time. Let's get ourselves a drink

312
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:22,026
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm terribly sorry sir.

313
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:26,489
He said he was sorry sir.
Now you sit down!

314
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:32,120
-28, black. You loose mister.
-That comes as no surprise at all.

315
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:37,834
-You're not accusing me of...
-Oh, no! Whiskey and three glasses, please.

316
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,383
I've got no more whiskey.

317
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,636
-I've got no beer either.
-Franklyn...

318
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,851
Everybody relax.

319
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:04,402
I want you to listen to me... real carefully.

320
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,698
Are you listening?

321
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,534
-Yeah.
-That's good. Now...

322
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:15,997
I want a bottle of whiskey and three glasses.
Right up here.. Come on!

323
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,250
Give'em. Right now. Come on.

324
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:25,798
Oh friend, you are not listening.

325
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,844
I said one bottle and three glasses.

326
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:37,894
That's right. I want you to pour carefully.
I don't want you to spill any


327
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,441
That's right. There is one.

328
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,571
Here you are! And one more to go.

329
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,992
Gentlemen !

330
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,746
Here is to the Union !

331
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,968
Now friends, just keep the peace.
Each man his own pew and we'll be taking our leave

332
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,111
Guys, there's some crazy Reb out ther!

333
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,453
Come on, Sergeant !

334
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,923
What music ! Bravo !

335
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:14,967
-Split Mountain! No Rodriguez no waggon!
-Thats right.

336
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:31,984
-The man's been and gone.
-He's got the waggon across and he left a clear track.

337
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,414
The trail heads right into that swamp.

338
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:51,879
-We lost five hours in this God forsaken place.
-Well Captain. We could have lost a lot more.

339
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:56,509
Indian ponies. Unshod.

340
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:02,557
-Let's head on in
-Nobody could get that heavy waggon through there


341
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:08,563
-Maybe it's Rodriguez.
-Yes, sir, Captain.

342
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,900
Now drop it.

343
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,365
Thank you to all the saints, it is you amigo,
I'm glad to see you.

344
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,784
Drop it

345
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,203
What this?

346
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,083
And thank you for taking that shot at me.

347
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:57,714
-Oh, but I did know it was you, amigo.
-Stay were you are
-In the mud?

348
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,012
-In the mud.
-I do not understand ! Ah, Capitane!

349
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:10,476
-You are a long way from Split Mountain.
-Where's the girl? 
-Gone.

350
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:15,606
-Gone. Gone where?
-She tried to give me to the Apache.

351
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:22,947
Si, si it's true. We crossed 
and were waiting at Split Mountain.

352
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:27,618
There weere the sound of horses. I knew
it was too soon to be you

353
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:33,249
Then I hear the Apache talk. She called out to them
I put her head into the water.

354
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,878
-Did you drown her?
-That is my sincerest hope, amigo.

355
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:42,342
-How many were they?
-You forgive me, I did not wait to count them,

356
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:47,638
You know amigo, I think the Captain here were a little worried
that you took this waggon for yourself.

357
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:56,564
Hey, Capitane! And you, compadre?
What did you think, huh?

358
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,651
I wondered.

359
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,324
All right.Let's get this waggon moving.

360
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:11,371
-Can I get out of the mud?
-Yeah, get out of the mud.

361
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:31,015
-Rodriguez doesn't kill so good.
-Could be an ambush.

362
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:37,271
Maybe. maybe not. But
we just can't leave it there.

363
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,486
-You can't. I can.

364
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:01,879
I hate to see brave men die.

365
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,758
Better we ride now, huh?.

366
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,514
Too bad !

367
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:16,060
Amigo, amigo, why?
Because you gave your word, huh?

368
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:28,322
This man is crazy. You gringos
drive me out of my mind!

369
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:27,131
She waited for us to come with the waggon
and we came.

370
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,134
She is the bait, this one.

371
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:46,234
Captain, take a good look.

372
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,565
We're moving out.

373
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:39,365
Do you have any orders, Captain?

374
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:43,286
You were right.

375
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:47,081
About her... or everything?

376
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:21,115
About sundown they will picking
us off one at a time...


377
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:24,744
...and we're sitting here
and waiting for orders.

378
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:30,833
Captain, you must have studied situations
like this at West Point?


379
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,338
-I bet you wre the first man in your class
-Thats right.

380
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:39,759
Amigo. You got nothing to worry about
You'll live to be a a hundred,

381
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:43,096
..and die in bed with some muchacha.

382
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:46,474
This is not very funny, my friend.

383
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:51,646
There is only one thing thats worries me, Captain,
That detail that were guarding those guns that were stolen.

384
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:57,568
Who was in commanded of that detail?
Was it you?

385
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:06,577
-I didn't hear what you said.
-Yeah, it was me.

386
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:14,794
What a shame to die out here in a place like this
and in blight of a great career

387
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:18,631
You are stupid enough
to become a general.

388
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:23,302
And don't you worry about it. You just live
long enough to see it.

389
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:01,341
-He's¸ taking off!
-He just may be trying to draw them off, Captain.

390
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,052
What a man !

391
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:56,312
Bueno amigo.. Bueno.

392
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:35,393
No! Let him burn! Let him burn!

393
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:45,486
If you don't like what they do,
don't make it right.

394
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:03,880
-You have killed him?
-No. He will be all right. I'll get some water.

395
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:06,966
No. there's no time for that. Two of those
Apaches got away.

396
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:11,304
You! You tie him up and put him on his horse.
-Si, Capitane.

397
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:01,312
The captain thought it was better
until you came back to yourself again.

398
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:10,488
-Who hit me?
-You were clear out of your head
-All right.

399
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:14,659
-No more problems.
-Captain!

400
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:17,745
He stays tied!

401
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:26,170
-Well, Captain. I've got a bottle in my saddle bag. Do you mind?
-Give him his bottle.

402
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:35,179
-Amigo, how do you feel, heh?
-Untie me and I'll feel better.

403
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:38,725
Oh I can not break the rules.. You heard the capitaine.

404
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:45,690
Maybe you can help you hold the bottle.

405
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:57,035
-Rodriguez ! Come here
-Hey, you save me some, heh?

406
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:01,122
I do not know what this man wants in this rain.

407
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:12,675
Ask her if there is anything more we can
do for the baby.

408
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:33,988
The baby is dead.

409
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:43,748
-Well do you think she knows it?
-She knows.

410
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:23,788
A chant for their own dead.
I think she will let you have the baby now.

411
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:29,228
-Maybe she'll tell us now.
-What?

412
01:01:31,439 --> 01:01:34,984
Ask her where the trade is going to take place


413
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:43,368
Even if she knows, she would never say.

414
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:49,207
Tell her we know about the guns, new
Medicine, her people are going to be given.

415
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,377
Tell her.

416
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,469
Tell her that we had come here
so we can keep her people from getting those guns.

417
01:02:01,678 --> 01:02:05,973
Not because I want my
people to be stronger in war than yours.

418
01:02:06,391 --> 01:02:09,227
We want no war.

419
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:14,649
None more babies.. our peoples or your peoples
shall ever die like this one day.

420
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,085
When we found her, she said three suns.

421
01:02:36,045 --> 01:02:39,716
There is still time if
the trade of place is not too far.

422
01:02:49,726 --> 01:02:54,230
Ask her.Ask her if she would lead us there.

423
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:03,489
Will you lead us there?

424
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:54,749
-Rodriguez is gone.
-Has he now?

425
01:03:56,751 --> 01:04:00,171
He took one of the repeaters too.

426
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:12,100
-Well, you don't look very surprised.
-Which way did he head?

427
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:19,816
Wich way would you think he was heading? You brought him along.

428
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:24,404
-Well, that depends on why Rodriquez left.

429
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:29,033
He might have decided that this
mission was all over...


430
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,495
...and you wouldn't be needing him no more.

431
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:36,749
You got two mules to pull this waggon and you
are not going to get very far


432
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:40,753
It sound like you want out too.

433
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:44,716
I told you I'd find Pardee.

434
01:04:44,882 --> 01:04:49,178
-When and where you'll find Pardee?
-I can't say.

435
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:53,391
-Maybe in two more days. Maybe.
-Maybe never.

436
01:04:55,309 --> 01:05:00,815
And if what she says is right, tomorrow
are gonna be too late. The Indians are gonna have those rifles.

437
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:05,903
-Now why don't you just go back to Presidio.
-Now, you would just like that wouldn't you?

438
01:05:06,738 --> 01:05:10,867
I give my big chance of becoming
a general?

439
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:17,874
Look Lassiter. I liked what you did back there.
Maybe you did save our lives.

440
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:22,837
Now, I don't know what you got in mind,
But if you want to get, then just get.

441
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:32,388
-Now, have you got some idea that she is goinna guide you?
-Well, I don't know.

442
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:39,729
-But your are going on anyway?
-Yep.

443
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:43,733
-To do what?
-Do what we came out here to do.

444
01:05:48,237 --> 01:05:52,533
-And you. You are going to go with him?
-Yeah.

445
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:58,081
Well, are you planning on becoming a general too?

446
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:02,752
Heh. That really would be something, wouldn't it?

447
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:08,424
Sergeant. I would be obliged if
you would get me my horse


448
01:06:27,694 --> 01:06:31,739
-Good luck to you !
-Thank you, Sergeant. And good luck to you.

449
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:47,839
About half a day's ride southwest of here
the Rio Conchos.

450
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:52,844
If Pardee's is not operating out of Presidio,
the Conchos is a good place to find him.

451
01:06:55,054 --> 01:07:00,393
You get to the Conchos, follow it
downstream about 3 miles past the big bend.

452
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:05,690
There is a box canyon with live oaks in it.
Makes good hiding place for the waggon.

453
01:07:05,898 --> 01:07:09,694
If I find my Pardee,
I'll bring him to you.

454
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,614
Thanks, Major.

455
01:07:15,283 --> 01:07:17,577
Major!

456
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:27,587
-And good luck to you, Captain.
-Good luck to you, Major.

457
01:08:16,386 --> 01:08:19,472
Tequila, heh?

458
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:34,404
-Dinero?
-Si
-Do you know many people here?

459
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:37,240
-Money! Molto dinero

460
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,703
-You have heard of a man Pardee?
-Never.

461
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,708
He is a gringo. He is very rich.

462
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:52,797
-I am a gringo myself and I am poor.
-Like me. On the side of my father.

463
01:08:53,965 --> 01:08:57,760
This is all I have to remember him by
It is bery nice, no?.

464
01:08:58,344 --> 01:09:01,264
Look. Solid gold.

465
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:06,477
And this was Mother's.
She was a very nice lady, my mother.

466
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:12,191
The chain is of gold too.
They are all gold. Nice, heh?

467
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:21,284
Senor, do you want something to eat?
Isabel !

468
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:26,456
Give something nice to this hombre to eat, huh?

469
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:28,499
Do you want something else, senor?

470
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:34,714
No I do not wish to sell such fine things
for a plate of beans.

471
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:38,593
We will serve you up stairs, senor.

472
01:09:40,178 --> 01:09:43,473
-Anita !
-Una momento!
-Pronto!

473
01:09:57,612 --> 01:10:01,115
Take a shot of tequila. Go on!

474
01:10:01,532 --> 01:10:05,119
It would be a pleasure to
be your guest...

475
01:10:05,328 --> 01:10:09,624
-.. if I did not have to find this Pardee.
-Pardee?
-Si.

476
01:10:12,835 --> 01:10:17,757
It seems to me I've something about such a man
.

477
01:10:18,049 --> 01:10:21,219
-Wait.
-Si. I wait.

478
01:10:34,482 --> 01:10:37,443
You were right.
There is such a man.

479
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:42,782
-But on a night like thist, it will gonna
take some time to find him
-Oh I'll wait.

480
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:47,870
Upstaris. Make yourself comfortable.

481
01:10:48,955 --> 01:10:53,126
( Pusti! He chose me !
-How? I saw him first. )

482
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:58,715
( I am beautiful. Thin. -It
cow. Skinny Cow... ). Maybe !

483
01:10:59,215 --> 01:11:04,804
-Tell me something, do you think she is too skunny this one?
-Take them both !

484
01:11:05,013 --> 01:11:08,891
-What are you waiting for, amigo?
-Of course !

486
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:38,546
-Jim!
-Chico !
-I see that gun and thought it was the crazy one here.

487
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:45,678
-Crazy one?
-He is upstairs. Come on sit down.
I'll buy you a drink, huh?


488
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:51,934
-What brings you here in the middle of such a night?
-Business.

489
01:11:52,769 --> 01:11:54,645
-With Pardee?

490
01:11:54,812 --> 01:11:59,650
-Now how did you know?
-Tonight, everbody is trying to find Pardee.

491
01:12:00,443 --> 01:12:05,156
-Including the crazy ones? Mexican
speaks english, got a rifle like this?

492
01:12:06,783 --> 01:12:11,996
-Yes. If it's going to be any shooting, Jim
-What are you talking about. He is
my partner. I sent him on ahead.

493
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:17,794
-Where is Pardee?
-His man is gonna be here soon
-In that case I'll better wake that one up.

494
01:12:18,628 --> 01:12:22,048
He did not go to sleep. Hey Anita!

495
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:28,680
Theres is not one, Theres is two, Jim!

496
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:38,981
Mi amigo! Come on up and bring a bottle !

497
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:47,031
-He never told me once that he had a partner.
-He is very careful man!

498
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:53,538
That's why I picked him. Pardees man gets here
you call me.

499
01:12:59,252 --> 01:13:01,838
Come in!

500
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:09,429
-I missed you this morning.
-Oh, you did not think I deserted you?

501
01:13:09,595 --> 01:13:13,266
To my fathers honor, whoever he was.

502
01:13:13,474 --> 01:13:17,061
Believe me, amigo. It was my plan
to share with you


503
01:13:17,228 --> 01:13:21,149
Just like now. Which one of these beauties
do you like?

504
01:13:26,863 --> 01:13:29,991
Come on, Anita.

505
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:43,046
This is better than being
the capitaine. That loco.

506
01:13:45,757 --> 01:13:49,052
You fooled me with that giving your word, amigo.

507
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:53,681
Well, I said that were going to bring his waggon to Pardee
Thats what we are doing, aren't we?.

508
01:13:53,973 --> 01:14:00,104
Hey stop it you drive me crazy. How much do
you think it is worth? 50 barrels of gunpowder, heh?

509
01:14:00,772 --> 01:14:04,025
About hundred american dollars a piece.

510
01:14:05,026 --> 01:14:08,946
-And we will share?
-Just like brothers.

511
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:12,408
We will drink to it, amigo.

512
01:14:23,586 --> 01:14:28,216
Amigo, who would have thought the night we got out
of jail...

513
01:14:28,424 --> 01:14:32,553
...that we would be here
like... a rich man,heh?.

514
01:14:35,348 --> 01:14:40,853
But I knew. You remember,
the time with a rope almost around my neck

515
01:14:41,813 --> 01:14:46,109
I said that my luck had changed

516
01:14:46,943 --> 01:14:49,696
We donn't have the money yet.

517
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:53,157
But we will. Tomorrow or the day after.

518
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:56,536
The waggon is where we can find it, yes?

519
01:14:56,703 --> 01:15:00,373
And the captain. And Franklyn.

520
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:04,669
You did not kill them?

521
01:15:05,795 --> 01:15:10,091
You left and they just let you go?


522
01:15:10,967 --> 01:15:14,303
I told them to was gonna find
Pardee.

523
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:19,017
You told them were gonna find Pardee?

524
01:15:27,734 --> 01:15:32,447
Lassiter, you and I.
We will live like kings.

525
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:36,868
If we sell the waggon instead of
blowing it up.

526
01:15:37,744 --> 01:15:42,999
To.. to blow it up?

527
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:48,379
-Everyone but us.
-Why should we do such a thing?

528
01:15:50,965 --> 01:15:54,052
You make a joke, heh?

529
01:15:55,345 --> 01:15:58,348
What do you think?

530
01:15:59,974 --> 01:16:06,105
-I think you're trying to fool me, amigo
-Rodriguez...

531
01:16:07,148 --> 01:16:12,945
Tell me something. Just one time in your life
did you ever think about doing something for somebody else,

532
01:16:13,154 --> 01:16:17,909
...somebody besides Rodriguez?
-Si. For you, amigo. For you

533
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,311
You did fool me, amigo.

534
01:16:46,729 --> 01:16:49,649
and I was wrong about the good omen.

535
01:16:49,899 --> 01:16:52,527
I remember now.

536
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:57,740
When I said meeting you again
had changed my luck

537
01:16:59,075 --> 01:17:04,539
And you said..for the worse!

538
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:45,621
The americano. Pardee's friend.

539
01:17:45,997 --> 01:17:49,584
Well now, you must be Lassiter.

540
01:17:49,876 --> 01:17:53,921
-Who are you?
-That's Pardee's man. New one

541
01:17:54,255 --> 01:17:59,052
-This Mexican I was sent here to see?
-We had a slight disagreement.

542
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:05,141
I dissolved the partnership and I
speak for him now.

543
01:18:08,978 --> 01:18:12,398
Well? Where is the Pardee?

544
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:17,195
Hand your weapon over to my men
and follow me.

545
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:25,328
Now, you can either hand them over or have them taken.
Live or dead, makes no difference to me

546
01:18:47,058 --> 01:18:51,270
-Fourteen pounder?
-Thats right.
-That's the fourth one I've seen.

547
01:18:53,064 --> 01:18:56,901
We have a brigade of light artillery
disposed through the heigths..

548
01:18:57,193 --> 01:19:02,573
This we are camped here permanently,
we take special precautions


549
01:19:18,506 --> 01:19:22,093
Corporal Dennis G. McWherter,

550
01:19:22,176 --> 01:19:26,597
charged with violation of Article 3,

551
01:19:26,848 --> 01:19:32,186
prohibiting officers to
possess personal firearmss

552
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:37,734
..further charged with dereliction of duty

553
01:19:38,109 --> 01:19:43,656
reflection the most grieving discredit
upon the arm and tradition of the army of the Confederacy.

554
01:19:44,824 --> 01:19:49,037
the general court marshall,

555
01:19:49,245 --> 01:19:52,915
The accused had obtained the benefit of counsel

556
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:56,627
...and judged his fellow officers are...
-Colonel Pardee?

557
01:19:56,836 --> 01:20:02,884
How dare you to interrupt a military
formation! Put yourself at attention!

558
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,220
-Yes, sir.

559
01:20:06,387 --> 01:20:08,765
Carry on !

560
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:12,769
-Fellow officers.. who have due the liberation

561
01:20:13,186 --> 01:20:18,191
...handed down the unanimous verdict.
Guilty.. as charged!

562
01:20:18,775 --> 01:20:24,822
-Proceed
-Firing squad, ready. Aim! Fire!

563
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:31,579
Dismissed! James, my boy!

564
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:37,585
It's good to see you!

565
01:20:37,919 --> 01:20:40,880
-Thank you, sir.
-Come on.

566
01:20:42,882 --> 01:20:47,053
I comissioned that man myself,
but he turned out a petty thief.

567
01:20:47,261 --> 01:20:49,806
Major at ease !

568
01:20:55,603 --> 01:21:00,608
What do you say now? A miracle, isn't it?

569
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:05,697
Chihuahua instead of Louisiana. Rio
Conchos instead of the Mississippi.

570
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:11,953
Riverview ! Back to life again
rising from the ashes.

571
01:21:12,161 --> 01:21:14,288
Beautiful, isn't it?

572
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:21,671
You have no idea how happy I am
to see you

573
01:21:22,088 --> 01:21:24,882
Come, my boy. Come.

574
01:21:25,091 --> 01:21:29,220
-I have been expecting you, you know.
-How is that sir?

575
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:34,767
Naturally your little little escapade in
Presidio were reported to me. We are well organized.

576
01:21:34,934 --> 01:21:39,105
It reminded me of our own
conversation.

577
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:41,691
-Colonel, may I talk to you?

578
01:21:41,816 --> 01:21:45,820
Out! I remember, you looked at
me as if I were mad.

579
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:52,201
-Sir, that is not so.
-No need to deny it, James.
I was not offended.

580
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:58,583
Here you can see for yourself
Here it is not all a dream, but reality.

581
01:21:59,751 --> 01:22:05,840
Actual wood and stone, land and an
army.Now.. What do you say?

582
01:22:08,426 --> 01:22:12,180
I'd like to join you, sir
If you still want me

583
01:22:13,014 --> 01:22:18,186
Tell me James. What did make you return
at this particular time?

584
01:22:25,902 --> 01:22:30,156
You do not know what day tomorrow is?

585
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:33,493
No, sir. I'm afraid I don't.

586
01:22:33,868 --> 01:22:36,496
I can't say I blame you.

587
01:22:36,662 --> 01:22:41,417
Not a pleasant day to remember.April 9th.

588
01:22:41,626 --> 01:22:46,673
It is just two years ago tomorrow that Lee
surrendered to Grant at Appomattox.

589
01:22:49,175 --> 01:22:55,056
We were better soldiers, better men,
a spiritous course, full of battles,

590
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:58,976
...and still we did not win the war.

591
01:23:00,395 --> 01:23:03,898
Have you ever asked yourself why?

592
01:23:04,607 --> 01:23:08,236
Because we were insufficiently ruthless!

593
01:23:08,778 --> 01:23:13,449
We allowed our own code of
honor to destroy us


594
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:17,870
But tomorrow, on the anniversary of that battle,

595
01:23:18,538 --> 01:23:23,751
I shall dispatch at least one thousand
mounted men against the enemy

596
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:29,090
...and they will be ruthless. I do not need
to organize them, instruct them or lead them,

597
01:23:29,507 --> 01:23:34,095
...and  ye they compare to the best
troops I've ever seen


598
01:23:37,223 --> 01:23:39,600
The Apache!

599
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:45,314
Ah, James...

600
01:23:45,648 --> 01:23:50,695
The plan is flawless. I give the Apaches these, they give
me gold and silver for them

601
01:23:50,862 --> 01:23:55,074
...and attack the enemy without pause or quarter
in the rear of this army,

602
01:23:55,616 --> 01:23:59,495
..in his home, as the enemy did to us


603
01:23:59,954 --> 01:24:03,750
Well Major, do you
approve of my tactics?

604
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:07,712
Sir. I think I can give you something that
will make your tactics more effective


605
01:24:07,962 --> 01:24:11,424
You mean the waggonload of gun powder?

606
01:24:15,595 --> 01:24:21,559
Theron Pardee, The Grey Fox. 
How in the world did I think I could fool you?

607
01:24:22,101 --> 01:24:26,022
Do you really know me, Major? Come.

608
01:24:30,109 --> 01:24:36,240
-It was picked up late yesterdaym
by one of my patrols.
-Well sir. That comes as absolutely no surprise.

609
01:24:36,449 --> 01:24:41,496
The only surprise is that it took
your people so long to find us


610
01:24:41,621 --> 01:24:44,999
...when we were trying so hard to be found


611
01:25:07,438 --> 01:25:11,776
Well. I see  there is no blood on any of you as I can see.
I told Colonel Pardee...

612
01:25:11,901 --> 01:25:16,239
...that you let yourself be taken.
-Please James, I'll talk first.

613
01:25:16,406 --> 01:25:21,160
-Or let them speak themselves.
-What good would that do? They would lie.
Deserters always do.

614
01:25:21,327 --> 01:25:24,789
That tells me nothing.
Renegades are always a risk.

615
01:25:24,956 --> 01:25:29,168
The man turns his coat once.
What is to prevent him for doing it again.

616
01:25:29,293 --> 01:25:33,840
-As for the black. Why should he wants to join us at all
-Well sir. I think
-No, James!

617
01:25:34,007 --> 01:25:39,303
-No, James. Let him talk. He's capable of talk I assume
-Yes


618
01:25:40,138 --> 01:25:43,099
Remove your hat !

619
01:25:47,854 --> 01:25:53,943
Well? Meaning no offense to you,
all I want of this is the money.

620
01:26:00,283 --> 01:26:05,663
-And you?
-Money. but alot more than you pay him.

621
01:26:06,164 --> 01:26:09,959
Ask the girl what she knows of these men.

622
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:28,853
They tried to make her to lead them
to the place where the guns would be traded,

623
01:26:29,103 --> 01:26:33,399
..to her people but she would not do it
-Well, sir. We figured that weherever the trade
where going to take place

624
01:26:33,524 --> 01:26:37,445
..that's were we would find the highest bidder.
whoever he might be.

625
01:26:40,031 --> 01:26:42,992
Open the canvas.

626
01:27:06,015 --> 01:27:09,811
-Do you want to see more, hefe?
-No, that's enough.

627
01:27:17,777 --> 01:27:21,698
Tell the girl to join her people.

628
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:34,544
Allright. I'll meet your price.

629
01:27:34,669 --> 01:27:37,672
Have the mules unhitched. We will leave the waggon here
for the time being.

630
01:27:37,797 --> 01:27:42,343
Tell them below to have a raft ready.
We will probably be shipping them the
same time the guns goes


631
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:47,473
-What about the money?
-Later today when I get mine

632
01:28:01,404 --> 01:28:06,242
Gold at $ 20 an ounce, 250
ounce, makes $ 5,000.

633
01:28:07,618 --> 01:28:10,872
$ 100 a barrel.

634
01:28:11,873 --> 01:28:15,543
As soon as the customer arrives, we strike the balance
and you will be paid. 

635
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:19,297
-Meanwhile I think this calls for a drink.
-Open the door!

636
01:28:26,512 --> 01:28:29,515
Give me the gold.

637
01:28:30,475 --> 01:28:35,438
Guns all here as you give word.
Here is gold that I promised.

638
01:28:36,773 --> 01:28:40,360
This gentleman is.
chief Blood Shirt.

639
01:28:40,526 --> 01:28:44,113
And here are the men that brought you
the wagonload of gunpowder.

640
01:28:44,322 --> 01:28:50,411
And this is their leader, Major James Lassiter.

641
01:28:52,038 --> 01:28:56,000
I drink to our coming victory!

642
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,923
You are not drinking, James.

643
01:29:03,675 --> 01:29:08,471
Lassiter. Lassiter.

644
01:29:10,223 --> 01:29:14,686
They tell me that there is such a man.
The great killer of my people.

645
01:29:16,187 --> 01:29:20,692
Often I think. What kind of man is this
Lassiter?

646
01:29:21,192 --> 01:29:25,571
..who hunts Apache as the
Apache hunts the white-eyed.

647
01:29:26,656 --> 01:29:30,034
Now I look, I see.

648
01:29:30,243 --> 01:29:34,372
It's the same as me.
The same hate here.

649
01:29:34,622 --> 01:29:39,335
Now, you say Lassiter come
to help Apache? Why?

650
01:29:41,462 --> 01:29:43,172
Why?

651
01:29:43,673 --> 01:29:45,842
-Gold. That gold.

652
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:49,846
-No, not for a waggon load full of gold.

653
01:29:50,096 --> 01:29:53,391
I will tell why Lassiter come.

654
01:29:53,641 --> 01:29:58,980
-To kill. And then to die.
-Is this the truth, James?

655
01:29:59,147 --> 01:30:03,234
-No.
-Yes! You know I speak truth !

656
01:30:03,609 --> 01:30:08,531
Here we are like brother.Same
dead seeds. Same alone.

657
01:30:08,698 --> 01:30:13,786
No women, no child
Only left to kill, to die.

658
01:30:13,953 --> 01:30:19,167
But new guns good.
With new guns Apache will kill. Kill. Kill.

659
01:30:19,709 --> 01:30:24,589
Until white-eye never forget
what he take from Apache.

660
01:30:24,797 --> 01:30:29,052
Always the blood of wife and child to remind him

661
01:33:30,692 --> 01:33:33,111
You want water?

662
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,781
Drink?

663
01:33:41,494 --> 01:33:46,958
It is good that you are strong.
At the next sun I come back for you

664
01:33:48,292 --> 01:33:51,129
We'll see how strong

665
01:34:07,937 --> 01:34:10,815
( Tomorrow we'll have a good time. )

666
01:34:32,337 --> 01:34:35,006
( Do not fall asleep.
-I will not, Chief. )

667
01:35:02,116 --> 01:35:06,996
( One of you will not be greeting
dawn. We want to have fun?)

668
01:35:07,288 --> 01:35:09,832
(Why not?)

669
01:35:12,543 --> 01:35:17,548
( Look at that one! Barely MIEE !)

670
01:35:25,765 --> 01:35:29,560
( Orders are orders, go. )

671
01:35:29,852 --> 01:35:35,149
( You're betraying the order?
-Yes, I do. )

672
01:35:37,026 --> 01:35:41,906
( If it is for the general good...
-If it is for evil. )

673
01:37:41,401 --> 01:37:45,530
Get him over there in that gulley.
You have a cover there.

674
01:37:45,738 --> 01:37:49,367
Where are you going? Blood Shirt, heh?

675
01:37:51,661 --> 01:37:56,332
-I'll give you plenty of time before I start shooting
-What about the guns?

676
01:37:56,499 --> 01:38:00,962
Isn'n that why we came here?
Or was that Apache right?

677
01:38:01,129 --> 01:38:04,090
You just wanna kill and be killed.

678
01:38:04,257 --> 01:38:08,886
That powder is a hundre yards from those guns and
you got nothing to light that fuse with.

679
01:38:09,095 --> 01:38:12,640
Help me to take my boot off.

680
01:39:06,986 --> 01:39:10,448
You know. He may be to be a general yet.

681
01:40:49,589 --> 01:40:52,508
You out for a little stroll, Lassiter?

682
01:40:52,717 --> 01:40:56,346
Major Johnson,
if you are gonnna pull that trigger...

683
01:40:56,429 --> 01:41:00,767
You had better aim good. Real good.

684
01:41:00,933 --> 01:41:04,103
You wouldn't wanna wake up the chief?

686
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:39,837
Major Johnson !

687
01:45:41,923 --> 01:45:45,385
Major Johnson !

688
01:46:34,308 --> 01:46:38,021
