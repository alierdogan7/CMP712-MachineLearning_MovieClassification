00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,941
BURT: My name is Burt Gummer.
And I've been called many things.

2
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,016
Gun enthusiast, monster-hunter,
doomsday-prepper.

3
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,584
I reject all these labels.

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,984
What I am is a survivalist.

5
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,713
I've scoured the dirt and dust
of Nevada and Mexico,

6
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,983
putting my life on the line to hunt
super-size subterranean

7
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,485
man-eating predators called Graboids.

8
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:56,723
Using a combination of local knowledge,
intuition and firepower,

9
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,758
I've managed to control
this deadly species,

10
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,769
and keep them confined
to the Northern Hemisphere.

11
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:02,537
Join me.

12
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:06,507
As I enter into and beneath
the Sands of Hell.

13
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:11,671
1500 hours. Moving through
the desert of Perfection, Nevada.

14
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,717
Ground zero for war with the Graboids.

15
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,013
For those of you newcomers,
who don't have a clue about Graboids,

16
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,754
let me bring you up to speed.

17
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,748
The Graboid is a vicious
subterranean predator,

18
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:25,022
about 30 feet in length
with a semi-rigid internal structure.

19
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,153
It senses its prey seismically,

20
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,057
and employs three powerful,
snake-like oral tentacles

21
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,602
to ensnare its prey,
and pull it into the Graboid's gullet.

22
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,638
It is not a pleasant venue.

23
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,400
Trust me. I've been there.

24
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,500
If that weren't enough,
Graboids give birth

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,671
to three ugly spawn we call Shriekers.

26
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,872
Short, squat, and blind bipedal bad boys

27
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,942
that sense and hunt their prey
using infrared sensors.

28
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,378
These, in turn,
give rise to the Ass Blaster,

29
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,113
a winged, predatory carnivore

30
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,989
which uses a mixture
of volatile chemicals in its...

31
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,051
(CLEARS THROAT) ...nether regions

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,859
to blast into the air
and swoop down upon its victims.

33
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,391
Ass Blasters carry eggs that hatch
and become new Graboids,

34
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,559
beginning this hellish cycle anew.

35
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,031
I have survived a great many
skirmishes with Graboids,

36
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,577
along with their Shrieker
and Ass Blaster kin.

37
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,970
And that makes me uniquely qualified

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,643
to teach you how to survive
whatever life throws at you.

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,381
And remember, life and survival

40
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,222
starts here.

41
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,193
(RATTLING)

42
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:32,986
Who's hungry?

43
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,775
- BASSON: What're you doing?
- (SHUSHING)

44
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,479
Shut your blow hole.

45
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,651
I'm tracking.

46
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,924
You feel that?

47
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,518
The only thing you're gonna feel
is my boot in your bum.

48
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,427
Yeah, good luck,
with that gimp leg of yours.

49
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,289
This place is gut boring.

50
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,959
Yeah. And I'm tired, and I'm starving.

51
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,935
And the only thing we've seen all day
is a pack of spotted hyena.

52
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,871
JOHAN: Yeah, it's just
the nature of things, boet.

53
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,732
Yeah, well, talking about nature,

54
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,709
I'm gonna drop the kids off at the pool.

55
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,948
Looking northwest, over the Highveld.

56
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,385
All those reports about exotic animals,
there's no wildlife here.

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,087
Well, speaking of wildlife, I wonder
if my wife's gonna come back to me.

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,484
If she's got brains, definitely not.

59
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,190
BASSON: You're a complete
and utter idiot.

60
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,798
I mean, I'm hurting here. I'm in pain.

61
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,536
And you mock me.

62
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,731
Basson. You hear that?

63
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,742
I didn't hear anything.
I'm in conference.

64
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,468
It's right here. Here, here, here, here.

65
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,070
(RUMBLING)

66
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,619
Whoa! Whoa!

67
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,015
(GRUNTING)

68
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,321
(SCREAMS)

69
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,227
Basson?

70
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,136
Dreyer!

71
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,104
That's a long drop.

72
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,102
Didn't you see this gigantic hole?

73
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,508
I think I broke my butt.

74
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:31,975
I'm gonna grab a rope.

75
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,404
(FLUTTERING)

76
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,676
Bro!

77
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,445
I'm coming, man, relax.

78
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,473
- Basson?
- Yeah?

79
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,574
I'm gonna throw this rope down.

80
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,576
You grab onto it,
I'm gonna pull you up, all right?

81
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,316
Hurry up. There's something down here.

82
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,016
Okay, grab the rope.

83
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,451
Get me out of here,
there's something down here.

84
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,552
Just get me out of here.

85
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,962
Yeah, probably my ex-wife, Teresa.

86
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,389
Pull!

87
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,162
Yeah, just help me out man, come on.

88
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,737
You need to lose some weight.

89
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,311
Get me out of here. I'm pissing myself.

90
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,553

00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,161
Basson!

00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,896
Basson!

(TINKLING)

96
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,204
Whoo!

97
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,848
107 degrees Fahrenheit.

98
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,051
Hello, Nevada.

99
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,292
Oh, yeah.

100

BURT: Everything tastes better outdoors.

101
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,976
However, if one wants to enjoy
a source of sustenance out here,

102
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,745
one has to seize the culinary initiative

103
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,348
when it rears its ugly head.

104
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,326
So, let's review.

105
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,953
It took me 50 minutes to build
this improvised clay oven.

106
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,523
Thirty-two minutes to
fire up the scrub wood,

107
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,391
heat the interior,

108
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,494
feed in that snake and seal the door.

109
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,631
Now we wait as this little baby

110
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,371
turns snake into snack.

111
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,485
Whoa!

112
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,087
That's hot!

113
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,355
Ah!

114
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,401
And voilá!

115
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,806
One sizzling, succulent
piece of pure protein.

116
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,265
(INHALES) Whoo!

117
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:04,737
And you can bet that Burt's Bullseye
Brand Cactus Juice Marinade

118
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,773
will eradicate any trace of that

119
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,877
"tastes like chicken" residue.

120
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,360

Yowza!

Smells like chicken.

Sorry, sir. I should've told you that.

127
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,137
Don't mean to be all stalkery,
but I've been a big fan of yours

128
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,217
since your Y2K conspiracy series.

129
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,778
Well, I guess that's a wrap.

143
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,512
All right, I got something for you here.

144
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,511
This is called a digital file.

145
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,013
It's gonna speak to my
awesome capabilities.

146
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,285
Kind of wish your website could do
the same for you, but I can help.

147
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,388
I beg your pardon?

148
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,363
I'm a big fan. You know,
possibly your biggest.

149
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,193
But the fact that you're out here
in Who-The-Hell-Cares, Nevada,

150
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,027
smokin' rattlesnake says something.

151
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,662
You know what it says?

152
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,072
It says you're underachieving
big time, my man.

153
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,442
You should be a global brand. Come on!

154
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,179
I mean, how many monster-hunters
do you know? Huh?

155
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,377
I know one. Burt Gummer.

156
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,950

followers did you have, huh?

157
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,779
Zilch.

158
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,682
Your opinion is duly noted.

159
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,586
It's what I'm here for.
To help build out the Burt Gummer brand.

160
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,463
I'm thinking, "Paranoid loner
meets charming whack job."

161
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,101
I can fix you.

162
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,870
I don't need fixing.

163
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,932
Yo, what happened to your dome, my man?

164
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,897
You binge watch Breaking Bad, again?

165
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,770
You trying to appeal to a younger
demographic, get a little Pitbull on us?

166
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,637
What I choose to do with my cranium
is none of your business.

167
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,476
All right.

168
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,420
This is snake, right, not rat?

169
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,649
Whoa!

170
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,254
That is a win.
That's a yummer from The Gummer.

171
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,822
You know what, you look
like you could use a cold one.

172
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,957
I know I can. You want?

173
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,060
Hey, I think we're vibing right now,
right, Pop? You feel it?

174
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,935
It's good talk. Where's your beer?

175
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,631
Hey.

176
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,239
Hands off my gear.

177
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,438
Lighten up, Pops.

178
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,672
You from the government?

179
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,542
Nope. Florida.

180
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,908
Grew up on the Gulf Coast.

181
00:12:56,008 --> 00:13:00,112
Panama City, Trampa, Pensacola.

182
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,850
- Pensacola?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,550
They got a great gun show.

184
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,357
Yeah, right off the Interstate.

185
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,397
I was there in '74.

186
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,722
You got that look.

187
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,058
What look?

188
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,229
The "I did some dirty
things in Florida" look.

189
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,634
Hey, I get it. It was the '70s,
free love, you were young.

190
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,064
(HONKING)

191
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,307
What now?

192
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,750
Looks like the IRS finally
caught up with you.

193
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,888
Mr. Gummer. Mr. Gummer.

194
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
(CHUCKLES)

195
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:40,990
You are way off grid, sir,
you're a very difficult man to find.

196
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,389
Evidently, not difficult enough.

197
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,324
I am Erich Van Wyk.

198
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,600
I'm with the South
African Wildlife Ministry.

199
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,932
South Africa? You with the government?

200
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,842
What? No, no. I'm a big fan of yours.

201
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,036
Go on.

202
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,144
Well, we have a rather pressing
situation in Gauteng.

203
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,544
Gauteng. The Cradle of Humankind?

204
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,045
Yes, that's right.

205
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,187
We have a confirmed sighting of what
you would refer to as an Ass Blaster.

206
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,119
That's impossible.
The species are confined

207
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,620
to the Northern Hemisphere.

208
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,257
Oh, well, then, I suppose
it's some other flying carnivore

209
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,328
that shoots flame out of its rear end
that we have wreaking havoc in Africa?

210
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,073
Is this a confirmed sighting?

211
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,006
Oh, yes, sir. Although the witness
is no longer alive.

212
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,911
- When do we leave?
- Excellent.

213
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,422
Slow your roll, there, Gums. Okay.

214
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,756
You're quite the fetching bushman,
Mr. Van Dick.

215
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,218
It's Van Wyk.

216
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,721
Van Wyk, right, okay. Um...

217
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,558
Mr. Gummer really isn't
in the monster business, anymore.

218
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,536
I'm what?

219
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,667
Give us a minute, will you?

220
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,429
What the hell are you doin'?

221
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:58,664
I'm working this dude for some paper.

222
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,832
Paper?

223
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,535
Cash. Listen.

224
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,774
You don't take the first offer.
Let me close this deal.

225
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,506
Request denied. I work alone.

226
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,141
Come on, but you need
a videographer, okay?

227
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,377
You need to take
the long view on this, okay?

228
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,253
Think about it. The Gummer in Africa.

229
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,416
This is our chance to catch you
on tape really doing what you do,

230
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,655
and really giving it
to those Ass Blasters.

231
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,759
Okay, that came out weird,
but you know what I mean, right?

232
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,768
This is real world, son.
You're a newbie.

233
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,661
Newbie?

234
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,530
Okay, stop being Burt for a second,
and just listen.

235
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,901
I may have not spent most of my life
fighting giant, blind worms,

236
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,513
but I spent the last 10 years
of my life deep in the shit.

237
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,609
Pulling gigs for CNN
and Fox in the sandbox.

238
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,219
Yeah, Afghanistan, Syria.
You know those places?

239
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,446
Yeah.

240
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,518
And as for firearms,

241
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,199
I just added this baby to my collection.

242
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,029
HK 91.

243
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,302
- Where'd you get that?
- Uh-uh-uh!

244
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,529
You punch my ticket to South Africa,

245
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:09,140
and will I hand over this beautiful,
semi-automatic Mr. Shotty to you.

246
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,373
Deal.

247
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,779
Erich. May I call you Erich?

248
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,308
Of course.

249
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,743
We really appreciate your offer,

250
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,381
but Mr. Gummer's monster-hunting
schedule's all booked up.

251
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,453
Sorry.

252
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,960
Oh, uh... That's a pity.

253
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,397
Bigfoot in the Ozarks.

254
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,229
Possible gremlin in Fresno.

255
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,435
Family of werewolves
in Peru we heard about.

256
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,504
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

257
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,846
I don't suppose it
would make any difference

258
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,683
if I offered to fully fund

259
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,024
Mr. Gummer's videos
for the next two years?

260
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:01,820
Four.

261
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,122
Three.

262
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,059
What time does your plane leave?

263
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,896
How quickly can you roll your tents?

264
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,567
Rolled.

265
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,711
Burt Gummer. In Africa.

266
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,946
MR. BRAVERS:
Africa's not for sissies, yeah?

267
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,816
We eat what we kill here, boet.

268
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,844
You mind if I call you boet?

269
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,010
Boet?

270
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,612
Yeah. It means brother.

271
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,992
So, you're the monster-hunter?

272
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,684
- Yeah, somethin' like that.
- (MR. BRAVERS LAUGHS)

273
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,129
BURT: This doesn't look like
any Ass Blaster I've ever seen.

274
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,230
- Strange attraction.
- Come again?

275
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,669
A man who hunts a monster.
It's a strange attraction.

276
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,041
Mr. Bravers, are you drunk?

277
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,303
(GRUNTS)

278
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,004
Not yet.

279
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,441
Mr. Gummer?

280
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,277
We're heading for a safari lodge,
just south of the river.

281
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,022
The owner's been kind enough
to let us base our operations there.

282
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,654
Hey, where's my bug-out bag
and the weapons I brought from home?

283
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,918
About that.

284
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,821
We have very strict customs laws
here in South Africa.

285
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,629
I should have warned you about
the three-day weapons quarantine.

286
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,725
Three-day what?

287
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,094
Don't worry about it.
I've procured us some weapons.

288
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,229
They're waiting for us at the lodge.

289
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,973
There, there it is, there, there.

290
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,400
Nice digs, Van Dyke.

291
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,175
It's Van Wyk.

292
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,369
- Hey, boet.
- Yeah?

293
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,971
I got a story for you.

294
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,607
Every morning in Africa,
a gazelle wakes up.

295
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,453
And he knows he's gotta run
faster than the fastest lion,

296
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,922
otherwise...

297
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,092
He gets killed.

298
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,264
Every morning, a lion wakes up.

299
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,156
And he knows he's gotta outrun
the slowest gazelle,

300
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,135
otherwise he's gonna starve to death.

301
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:58,067
So, it doesn't matter if you are
a lion or you're a gazelle,

302
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,871
in Africa, when the sun rises,
you better be running.

303
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,403
(CHUCKLES)

304
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,576
Hey, if you need my help,
call me on the horn.

305
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,110
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

306
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,211
(SPITS)

307
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,283
(LAUGHS)

308
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,021
- Now, you go well, boet.
- Thank you.

309
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,361
Chop-chop, Pops.

310
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,163
Stop calling me "Pops."

311
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,598
Got you.

312
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,109
Old man.

313
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,346
And we're clear!

314
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,771
What? I don't understand.

315
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,873
This is a seismic vibration monitor.

316
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,910
It's uplinked to the South African
National Grid of Seismology

317
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,080
and can detect Graboid movement
within a 50 square-mile area.

318
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,318
Next level type stuff.

319
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,816
Graboid? Worms?

320
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,156
Exactly.

321
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,852
This is Johan Dreyer.

322
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:58,123
He's my local field representative
and a safari guide in the area.

323
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,591
He's the one who witnessed
the fatal attack.

324
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,792
That's right.

325
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,806
And this towering hunk of dark chocolate
is my assistant, Thaba.

326
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,934
That's quite a gun you got there.

327
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,300
Rifle.

328
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,243
Bet it makes you feel like
you got a lot of power.

329
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,139
I can drop a charging
rhino at 100 meters.

330
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,510
You wanna go for a run?

331
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,015
How's life in the Thunderdome?

332
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,011
Well, you wouldn't know
what a rhino looked like

333
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,556
if it shoved its horn
through your throat.

334
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:27,262
Graboids and Ass Blasters are immune
to any known form of tranquilizer,

335
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,959
rendering your weapon useless against
the creatures we're hunting.

336
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,102
Capturing. Capturing,
that's the plan, right?

337
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,403
You don't capture these things.
You kill them.

338
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,598
Kill them, capture them, I don't care.

339
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,440
But what we have in Africa, sir,
is not Graboids.

340
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:48,180
If you've got Ass Blasters,
you've got Graboids.

341
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,569
Odontotermes baadi.

342
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,503
Yes.

343
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,140
But on a massive scale.

344
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,508
It has the same magnesium mandibles.

345
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,149
That explains the presence of formic acid
in the bedrock surrounding it.

346
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,186
It spits out the acid to soften the rocks,
while the mandibles chew through it.

347
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,454
This is a super digger.

348
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,065
We're going to be on the cover
of Science magazine.

349
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,090
Been there, baby.

350
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,232

Okay, let's go.

1066
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,182
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1067
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:28,784
Come, come, come, come on.

1068

1070
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:37,659
They're here.

1071
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,398
Okay. All we need to do
is get to your truck.

1072
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:44,069

Again with the roof?

1075
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:55,544
Whoo!

1076
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,582
I like this badass Baruti.

1077
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,888
Come. Come, Amahle.
Come on, get in the back.

1078
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:09,925
Good girl.

Shit!

1081
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,894
It couldn't make it
through the concrete slab.

1082
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,022
Okay, it's turning around.

1083
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,995
I've got an idea.

1084
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,637
All right. Stay here, baby, okay?

1085
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,213
Give me a light, give me a light.

1086
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:04,813
There you go. Thanks.

1088
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,659
- Thanks for the gas.
- No worries, boet.

1089
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:54,429
Hey, look, I've gotta go
and fight a fire in Zululand,

1090
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,365
and my girl's running on fumes.

1091
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,235
- So, if you need me...
- I can reach you on the horn.

1092
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:00,739
Yebo.

1093

I've got a feeling
you're gonna be needing this.

Sunshine State. Lotta ladies.

1105
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:38,840
I'm askin' what you know
about me and Florida.

1106
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,276
I know that you went
to a Grateful Dead concert once

1107
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:42,411
when you were there.

1108
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,889
How could you possibly know that?
That was 40 years ago.

1109
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,855
Pretty sure I know who you went with.

1110
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,431
What do you know about Jasmine?

1111
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:03,635
Flower child meets heroin chic. Model.

1112
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:07,076
Hated disco. Loved Hendrix.

1113
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:11,379
You were selling your dad's old guns.
She was in the parking lot.

1114
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:13,875
Burning her bra.

1115
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,886
Far left meets far right.

1116
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,018
They spend the night.

1117
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,056
Love's a bitch, huh, Burt?

1118
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:24,759
Who is she to you?

1119
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,695
I call her "Mom" most of the time.

1120
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,227
Boom!

1121
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,273
Well, that's gotta stir up
some shit, right? Huh?

1122
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,165
You mean, you and me are...

1123
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,677
That's right. Bloodlines.

1124
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:41,742
Feel the theme happenin', here?

1125
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:44,606
- No.
- Yes.

1126
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,109
No. Impossible.

1127
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,844
You're tellin' me.

1128
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:51,652
I don't believe it.
There's no way you're my offspring.

1129
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,117
What? Well, that's a dick thing to say?

1130
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,321
What, do you think
you're better than me?

1131

I just don't... I mean... Crud.
Look at you!

1132
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:02,924
Yeah, look at me.

1133
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,960
How could I be the son of Burt Gummer?

1134
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,698
A man of such towering importance.

1135
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,765
You know what? Forget it.

1136

We don't have to do
this whole Dr. Phil thing, okay?

Let's just survive this
African worm invasion,

1138
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,643
and we'll go back to never speaking
to each other again. Cool?

- Amahle.
- What's going on?

I think I know why we're under attack.

Where would they go?

No, no, no. We can't
risk hitting the girl.

1179
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,099
What does she have in that basket?

1180
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,701
I think she's got an Inkanyamba egg.

1181
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,937
- That egg is the last of the bloodline.
- NANDI: Why do you say that?

1182
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:44,305
Because we blew up their nest.

1183

Look, we have a hostage situation.

1184
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:50,779

as long as she has the egg.

- TRAVIS: Yeah.

Okay. One of us is gonna be bait
and one of us has gotta snatch the kid.

- I'll get her.

- I think I have an idea.
- Shoot.

1198

Amahle always uses her earthworm
zapper to catch worms.

1199
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,523
We can build one on a much larger scale.

1200
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:44,263
We have the worm.
What do you suggest we use for the zap?

1201
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:46,596
The lightning.

1202
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:51,309
We can use the pile rods from the drill rig
and wire them together.

1203
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,536
You can set your watch
to the lightning, right?

1204
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:56,571
Yes, and right now we've got 13 minutes.

doesn't get cold feet.

01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,945

- I can try.

she'll follow your seismic signature.

Send them to the river
and bring them back on my signal.

1210

- Your signal?
- I'll send up a flare.

1211
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,207
Give me some slack.

01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:23,082
You're a good man. Deep down there.

1235
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:24,338
What, it's not on the surface?

1236
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:28,013
It rarely ever is.
You've gotta dig deep.

1237
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:33,714
See ya.

1238
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:36,020
NANDI: Amahle!

1239
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:51,775
Good work today.

1240
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:53,903
Yeah.

1241
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:56,007
You, too.

1242
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,751
So, what's the next stop
on the Burt train?

1243
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,950
More Who-The-Hell-Cares, Nevada?

1244
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:06,984
It's home.

1245
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:10,518
Where you goin'?

1246
01:33:10,618 --> 01:33:11,653
I don't know.

1247
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:14,629
Probably back to Florida.

1248
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:19,900
Okay. You take care, you hear?

1249
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:34,642
Hey, wait a minute.

1250
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,578
What about my career?

1251
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:38,918
What about it?

1252
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:40,453
We had a deal.

1253
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:45,057
You said you were gonna take
the long view, build the Gummer brand.

1254
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:47,193
Said you were gonna fix me.

1255
01:33:58,366 --> 01:34:00,107
You don't need fixin', Pops.

1256
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:05,182
Now, come on.
We got a gremlin to catch in Fresno.

1257
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:08,147
Pops.

1258
01:34:45,146 --> 01:34:48,149
BURT: My name is Burt Gummer,
and I've been called many things.

1259
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:51,492
Gun enthusiast, monster-hunter,
doomsday-prepper.

1260
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:53,421
I reject all these labels.

1261
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,967
What I am is a survivalist.

1262
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:58,292
TRAVIS: And I'm Travis B. Welker.

1263
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:01,729
I've been accused of being a ninja
photographer, an adrenaline junkie,

1264
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:03,864
and hitting on hot 22-year-olds.

1265
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:05,238
I'm guilty on all accounts.

1266
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:07,902
I embrace these labels,
and I live by them.

1267
01:35:08,002 --> 01:35:13,174
BURT: And together, we're taking
on the bizarre, the deadly, the weird.

1268
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:14,878
TRAVIS: It's a dirty job.

1269
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:16,987
But dirty guys are sexy.

1270
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:20,548
BURT: We've cracked the code of survival.

1271
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:24,622
We are the cure that ails anything
crittery, creepy or crawly.

1272
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:29,123
TRAVIS: We are the knockout punch
to the shadowy world of monsters.

1273
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:30,668
BURT: Go, go, go!

1274
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:34,428
MAN: I don't know what the hell
you unleashed in there.

1275
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:36,163
BURT: So, if you need us
for anything that goes

1276
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:38,099
bang in the night
or fluff under your floor...

1277
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,600
- It's over here!
- Watch your back!

1278
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,701
- TRAVIS: Or just...
- (EXCLAIMS)

1279
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:43,337
BURT: ...reach us on the horn.

1280
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:48,045
And remember, survival
and life starts here.
