(<i> audience oohing, applauding</i> )

3
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,569
Now, if the young lady
will open her eyes

4
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,170
and examine
the spots on the card.

5
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,205
They're gone!

6
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,806
But not your fingers,
I hope.

7
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:48,740
No...

8
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:49,975
Ladies and
gentlemen,

9
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,411
any of you can
shoot the spots
from playing cards,

10
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,048
given a steady hand,
keen eyes, iron nerves...

11
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,549
and 12 years
of practice.

12
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,792
My gratitude
for your assistance.

13
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,160
And to show
my appreciation,

14
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,361
I'd like to present you

15
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,996
with these
beautiful earrings.

16
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,397
I was told that
they once belonged

17
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,500
to the grand padishah
of Hindustan.

18
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:15,534
(<i> audience laughs</i> )

19
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,802
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Carter.

20
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,903
Thank you.

21
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:18,837
You're very welcome;
thank you.

22
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,172
(<i> applause</i> )

23
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,907
Now, would another intrepid soul
step forward

24
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,442
to assist in a demonstration

25
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:26,078
which has astounded the crowned
heads of 11 countries?

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,179
(<i> audience murmuring</i> )

27
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,514
Anyone will do.

28
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,216
No harm can possibly
come to you.

29
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,519
Aha, I see I have a candidate.

30
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,454
That's the spirit, young fellow.

31
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:37,256
Up the steps
right onto the stage.

32
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,390
Bring your feet with you.

33
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,758
(<i> audience chuckles</i> )

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
Stand there.

35
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,328
Take this deck of cards.

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,364
While my back is turned,
choose one--

37
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,365
any card will do.

38
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,366
CARTER:
Do you have it?

39
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,500
YOUNG MAN:
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,902
CARTER:
Show it to
the audience.

41
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,103
What do you
think?

42
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:52,571
Sure enough
resembles him.

43
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,439
Exceptin' the time I seen him,
he had whiskers.

44
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,741
(<i> someone shushes men</i> )

45
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:58,410
Well, the best thing is
to catch him outside.

46
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,145
CARTER:
Now put it back
in the deck.

47
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,814
Now watch closely.

48
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,883
In my left hand
I have the deck of cards,

49
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,252
in my right, the personal
throwing weapon

50
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,021
of the late
Colonel James Bowie.

51
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,056
With its help,
I shall endeavor

52
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,458
to discover the card
in question.

53
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,529
(<i> audience gasps</i> )

WOMAN:
Well, I'll be!

55
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,734
The ace of hearts.

56
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,770

58
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,913
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Here he comes.

00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,915
(<i> whistling continues</i> )

60
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,286
Colonel
Desmond?

61
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,622
Colonel
Desmond?

62
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,090
You gentlemen
speaking to me?

63
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,191
We were.

64
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,559
Afraid there must be
some mistake.

65
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,827
The name is
Johnny Carter.

66
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,761
Ah, no it
ain't.

67
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,163
I couldn't forget you,
Colonel.

68
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,931
Our outfit fought
right alongside of you

69
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,932
at Forest Ridge.

70
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,033
Just a minute,
Scamper.

71
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,102
Maybe introductions
are in order,

72
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,203
Mr., uh, Carter.

73
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,938
This is Mr. Newton,
Sergeant Joad,

74
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,406
and I'm Jeb Bassett.

75
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,176
All formerly of
the Ninth Virginia.

76
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,577
How do you do?

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,816
You were in the Confederate
Army, Mister... Carter?

78
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:11,883
Why, yes.

79
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,719
Yes, I was.

80
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,620
Good.

81
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,021
We want to make you
a proposition.

82
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:19,091
We need a man like you
where we live-- Coppertown--

83
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,093
to keep us from losing
our claims.

84
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,861
I know nothing
about mining.

85
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,296
The mines are all right.

86
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,831
There's something else.

87
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,834
We're being frozen out
because we're Southerners.

88
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,535
Coppertown's smelter
won't buy our ore.

89
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,237
We've had accidents
in the mine.

90
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,672
Three men killed already.

91
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,907
When one of us tries
to take ore to Mesa City,

92
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,310
something always happens
to him or his wagon.

93
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,311
What about
the law?

94
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,312
Get away
from me,

95
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,913
you overgrown
jackrabbit.

96
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,050
The law's against us, too,
won't raise a finger to help.

97
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:48,754
That's why we need a man like
you, Colonel-- er, Mr. Carter--

98
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:49,988
as a leader and...

99
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,356
Law breaker?

100
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,425
Let's say someone
who can face up to the law

101
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,693
if it isn't doing right.

102
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,429
What in tarnation do you want?

103
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,598
Chewing tobacco,
Sergeant.

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,899
SCAMPER:
Chewing tobacco?

105
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,735
Why-why, I never heard
of anything like...

106
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:04,836
What brand?

107
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:05,837
Here you are.

108
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,705
Well, gentlemen,

109
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,173
it's true I was
in the war,

110
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,241
but as a corporal.

111
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,642
But now I'm
a peaceful man,

112
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,544
following
a peaceful occupation.

113
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,180
I'm sorry, but I must refuse
your invitation.

114
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:17,616
Good night.

115
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,017
Colonel?

116
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,986
We were told to give you
a special message

117
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,088
from the man who brought us
out here--

118
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,589
Mr. Theodosius Roberts,

119
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,559
formerly of
Beardsville, Virginia.

120
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,760
Name's unfamiliar.

121
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,596
We got the wrong man,
Jeb.

122
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,831
I guess
you're right.

123
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,700
Nothing on earth could
keep Colonel Desmond

124
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,001
out of the fracas
we got.

125
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,369
Let's mosey.

126
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,441

You done nothing
against the law.

140

Some people are kind of fussy
about ladies smoking.

know better by now.

something.

Go ahead, Cora.

Not at all.

What can I
do for you?

Today is payday

your protection.

Now, Mr. Balfour,

185
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,849
there ain't gonna be
any trouble.

186
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,051
The Southerners have been
acting strange

187
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,052
the last few days.

188
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,287
Secretive and arrogant.

189
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,424
They're planning something,
maybe robbery.

190
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,559
Robbery?

191
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,127
You better go hold
his hand, Sheriff.

192
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,595
Who, me?

193
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,797
I'm no man for robberies,
I don't even carry a gun--

194
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,165
can't stand the noise!

195
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,067
You go, Travis, and take
Bat here with you.

196
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,435
You're my deputies,
ain't you?

197
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,570
All right.

198
00:08:58,572 --> 00:08:59,771
But I'll tell
you this, Balfour,

199
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,106
the Rebs is
done for.

200
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,641
I disagree.

201
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,777
They're like wolves--
vicious, desperate.

202
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,179
They're just
a defeated people,
Mr. Balfour.

203
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,848
And rightfully so!

204
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,053
Slavers, secessionists,
lawbreakers and murderers!

205
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,323
They're like anyone else--
human beings.

206
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,859
I never could understand
why you won't deal with them.

207
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:24,129
Perhaps you would, ma'am,
if you lost a son at Gettysburg!

208
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,165
NEWTON:
Seems we had
the wrong man,

209
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,099
Mr. Roberts.

210
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,368
Some fly-by-night
vaudeville actor.

211
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,469
Name of
Johnny Carter.

212
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,737
That's strange...

213
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,973
He must look
mighty like
Colonel Desmond

214
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,942
because Scamper
was fooled.

215
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,810
Still am, 'ceptin'
it couldn't be,

216
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,412
not after the way
he acted.

217
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,513
We put it
straight to him;

218
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,148
mentioned your name,
like you said,

219
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,949
and told him
that....

220
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,083
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

221
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,484
Who could that be,
Caroline?

222
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,886
I'll go see,
Gramp.

223
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,491
Oh, it's you.

224
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,759
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

225
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,428
You see, I've got
orders to find out...

226
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,562
Same old orders,
Lieutenant,

227
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,930
or some nice,
fresh, new ones?

228
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,732
Well, it's just that
I have to make inquiries

229
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,534
as to whether you've
had any news of...

230
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,336
Oh, no, not again?

231
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,337
Sorry, ma'am.

232
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,771
My dear Lieutenant,

233
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,807
I may not look it,
but I'm quite grown up.

234
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,308
I can count up to ten

235
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,644
and I can even remember
as far back as a week ago.

236
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,446
I feel awful about this,
ma'am, but...

237
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,780
Oddly enough,
I can even remember

238
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,349
the questions
you asked me.

239
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:20,185
Now, since you've obviously
forgotten my answers,

240
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:23,288
I'm going to repeat them
to you again very slowly

241
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,224
and maybe it will save you
another visit.

242
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,861
Now, about my
brother-in-law,
Colonel Desmond.

243
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,695
One.

244
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,896
I haven't
heard from him.

245
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,398
In fact, I've never
heard from him.

246
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,599
Two.

247
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,034
I've never seen him
in my whole life

248
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,902
and I wouldn't know him
if I did see him,

249
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,671
because he was in
one of your prisons

250
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:40,905
when Tom and I
were married,

251
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,242
and he was still there
when Tom was killed.

252
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,243
Three.

253
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,078
And if I had him
right here in my pocket,

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,448
I certainly wouldn't
tell you!

255
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,616
Now...

256
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,219
do you think you can
remember all that?

257
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,353
Uh, yes, Mrs. Desmond.

258
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,788
Wonderful.

259
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,856
And isn't it enough

260
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:58,957
that he's
a defeated soldier

261
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,558
without your
persecuting him?

262
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,627
Oh, in this case, ma'am,
it isn't exactly persecution.

263
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,129
Well, what is it?

264
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,564
Well, you see, when Colonel
Desmond was a prisoner of war,

265
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,300
he escaped with the contents
of the Commandant's safe--

266
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,702
$20,000.

267
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,203
Good for him.

268
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,239
Well, now, why didn't you
tell me that before?

269
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,573
That's wonderful!

270
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,143
I'm afraid the United States
government feels different.

271
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,845
It'd like both him and
the money locked up again.

272
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,949
Oh...

273
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,685
Well, how long a term
would he receive?

274
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,188
They're saying ten years.

275
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,923
I know how you feel,
ma'am.

276
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,826
If you happen not to be
telling all you know,

277
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,327
I... wouldn't
blame you.

278
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,462
I think you better go.

279
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,730
What I'm trying
to say

280
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,065
is I'd much rather
be chasing Indians,

281
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,599
but since I have orders,
it's not...

282
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,934
ROBERTS:
Did you hear

283
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,536
what my granddaughter said,
Lieutenant?

284
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,437
Yes, sir.

285
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,671
And in the future,

286
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,207
please remember you
are not welcome here.

287
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,649
Is that the young fellow
who was here before?

288
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,017
Yes.

289
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,785
But I don't think
he'll come back again.

290
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:01,853
Couldn't be
he's the reason

291
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,154
Colonel Desmond
wouldn't come,

292
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,522
wouldn't admit
who he was?

293
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,557
SCAMPER:
Might be.

294
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,492
No, Gramp,
it couldn't be.

295
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,560
If he were
Tom's brother,

296
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,694
he'd have come
regardless.

297
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,262
I reckon
you're right.

298
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,265
I reckon I don't have to say
that I'm disappointed.

299
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,335
Seems every hope we've
cherished for a year

300
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,536
has been a mirage.

301
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,938
Fool's gold.

302
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,846
BALFOUR:
Joseph Senn.

303
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,914
Yes, sir, Joseph Senn!

304
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,717
Ah, mister,
I do like payday.

305
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,252
I guess
that's right.

306
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,053
Yes, sir,
just is.

307
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,554
Rainbow Saloon,
here I come!

308
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,589
(<i> all laugh</i> )

309
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,723
Save me a drink,
Joe!

310
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,991
William Barton.

311
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,460
That's me, and is this
a happy moment.

312
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,828
William Barton.

313
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,063
Nothing wrong
with that.

314
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,298
BASSETT:
Let me through here!

315
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,602
What do you want?

316
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,603
I want a word
with you.

317
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,737
I'm busy!

318
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,005
You weren't too busy
this morning

319
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,573
while you were smelting
my copper.

320
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,775
What do you mean?

321
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,176
Just what I'm saying.

322
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,245
While my boys was off hunting
and I was away,

323
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,480
some thieving scoundrel
carried my ore up here

324
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,548
and you smelted it
for him.

325
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,749
I want to know who.

326
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,417
I don't know anything
about your ore

327
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,418
or any other
Rebel's!

328
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,486
You're lying!

329
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,488
Either tell me who stole it
or pay for it--

330
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,489
I don't much care which.

331
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,490
Take it easy,
Bassett.

332
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,892
You keep out of this.

333
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,960
For once we're going to get
a square deal here!

334
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,464
Outside.

335
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,503
Get back,
all of you.

336
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,077
Keep moving!

337
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,513
I'm going, but
I ain't finished.

338
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,348
Watch that
door.

339
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,919
So you're telling me
to keep out of this,

340
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:41,920
huh, Bassett?

341
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,021
I certainly am.

342
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,122
Supposing
I don't?

343
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,657
We'll get someone
around here

344
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,458
who'll see
there's right.

345
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,694
Go ahead,
Ethan.

346
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,829
(<i> blows thudding</i> )

347
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,664
BAT:
Don't mark up
his face.

348
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,400
We want him pretty
for his folks.

349
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,874
Get him up and
out of there.

350
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,443
BALFOUR:
Travis!

351
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,881
You needn't have been
so brutal.

352
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,416
Why, Mr. Balfour,
you told me yourself

353
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,184
they're as dangerous
as wolves.

354
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,623
(<i> men cheering, firing guns</i> )

355
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,265
Whoopee!
Girls!

356
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,170
What is it?

357
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,938
Entertainers--
girls!

358
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,040
Ah, no, you don't!

359
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,881
Hooray!

360

00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:56,961
Mr. Bixby.

362
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:57,962
That's me.

363
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,997
Ma Tarbet's
my name.

364
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,098
Welcome to
Coppertown.

365
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,165
I own this place.

366
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,567
Get your troupe in

367
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,569
and I'll show them where
they're going to roost.

368
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,571
Get back, boys,
get back.

369
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,573
The show goes on
tonight.

370
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,574
Hello.

371
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:11,676
Hello.

372
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,677
Hello.

373
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,678
I'm the professor.

374
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,913
I play the piano.

375
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,381
I'm going to play
for you tonight.

376
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,482
Hey, hey!

377
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,484
(<i> crowd laughs</i> )

378
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,753
I'll help him, sonny.

379
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,288
Watch it,
Professor.

380
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,258
Whoopee! I'm going to put
my brand on this one!

381
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,861
Whoa! No,
put me down!

382
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,696
(<i> men yelling</i> )

383
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,864
(<i> gun fires</i> )

384
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,198
That a boy, Lew!

385
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,434
Hold it, boys,
hold it!

386
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,435
Hold it!

387
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,005
Lew Partridge,
put that girl
down.

388
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,041
I said put that girl down.

389
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,076
PARTRIDGE:
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Lisa.

390
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,478
I... I never meant no harm.

391
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,313
That's better.

392
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,781
MAN:
Good for you, Lisa.

393
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:54,052
(<i> crowd merrily conversing</i> )

394
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,226
By golly,
he did come.

395
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,128
Who'd you say came?

396
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,897
Oh, nobody.

397
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,332
Nobody at all.

398
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,500
I... I was just talking
to myself, that's all.

399
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,505
He must've come here
to help us.

400
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,343
Oh, thunderation,
it's you again.

401
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,944
Or maybe it's
your cousin.

402
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,179
Oh, well,
here, here.

403
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,182
(<i> donkey neighing</i> )

404
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,516
I thought we had troubles before

405
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,051
but it's nothing
to what's coming.

406
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,753
The boys
will probably be riding horses

407
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,054
up and down the halls all night.

408
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,789
Why don't you put
two in a room?

409
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,124
Two in a room?

410
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,492
I'm putting five
in a room.

411
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,694
Come on, gals,
I'll show you the way.

412
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,829
That leaves us two men.

413
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,364
Yes, you and
Signor Martelli.

414
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,565
Johnny Carter,
ma'am.

415
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,034
I thought you had
an Italian tenor.

416
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,669
Well, unfortunately,
he disappeared.

417
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,371
It's the strangest thing
I ever saw.

418
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,139
With us one minute
and gone the next.

419
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,507
Yes, luckily for you,

420
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,876
I had a few free days
between engagements.

421
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,644
You do sing Italian,
of course.

422
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,880
Only in the bath, ma'am.

423
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,981
What is this?

424
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,217
Mr. Carter
is a trick-shot artist.

425
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,318
Trick-shot
artist?!

426
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,153
Why, the town
is full of them.

427
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,287
TRAVIS:
Yes, it is.

428
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,657
And so is
the cemetery.

429
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,527
I hear you've got quite
an extensive one in Coppertown.

430
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,229
Well, I guess he'll
have to do.

431
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:12,663
You'll share
the same room.

432
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:13,998
Thank you,
Miss Roselle.

433
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,634
You know, ma'am, I never thought
the day would come

434
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,070
when I'd regret not being
an Italian tenor.

435
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,916
Well, I'm saying
we should pull up stakes.

436
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,518
And I'm saying
you're a quitter.

437
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,653
Ain't we got the
right on our side?

438
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,155
That we have.

439
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,724
Yes, and Moss Balfour
has got the might.

440
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,725
If we stick
together

441
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,093
like we done
through the war,

442
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,728
ain't nobody
gonna whip us.

443
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,029
As soon as my boys
get back,

444
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,165
I'm aiming to square
accounts with Travis

445
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,166
and that other
deputy.

446
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,267
WOMAN:
Jeb Bassett,

447
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,102
you lay back like
the doctor said.

448
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,370
MAN:
Sorry,
Mrs. Bassett.

449
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,538
We'll move along,
Jeb,

450
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,306
and let you get
a little rest.

451
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,208
Now, Martha, I'm fine.

452
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,743
We just heard
about it, Dad.

453
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,211
You hurt bad?

454
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,447
I'll be up and around
in a couple of hours.

455
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,216
Then we can decide what to do.

456
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,785
Jeb, you ain't gonna
pull them into this.

457
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,621
What's a man have sons
for if not to help him?

458
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,489
He's right, Ma.

459
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,191
I suffered enough
from the war,

460
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,325
losing Carey
and Tom,

461
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,960
worrying and praying
for you

462
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,061
and the other boys.

463
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,763
I'm wore out
with suffering.

464
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,902
Why can't we leave
like the others,

465
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,571
go someplace where it's safe?

466
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:30,675
A man's got to do
what he thinks best, Mother.

467
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:40,651
(<i> man whistling cheerfully</i>
<i>in distance</i> )

468
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:43,955
(<i> whistling grows louder</i> )

469
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,424
(<i> knock on door</i> )

470
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,725
Come in.

471
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,195
Mr. Roberts.

472
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,064
Yes, come in.

473
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,699
Come right in, please.

474
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,835
I was told you wanted
to see me.

475
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:58,903
My name is...

476
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,037
Why, of course.

477
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,539
I know who you are.

478
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,908
Can't escape a reputation
like yours, you know.

479
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,909
Well, thank you,
sir.

480
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,110
It is kind of
a showy act,

481
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,345
but people seem
to like it.

482
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, sit down,
Colonel, sit down.

483
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,114
No colonel.

484
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,016
Just plain
Johnny Carter.

485
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,918
Oh, well,
sit down anyway.

486
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,419
Thank you.

487
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,256
And, uh, Mr. Carter,
with a reward out

488
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,291
for Colonel Desmond's arrest

489
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:24,362
and every Yankee soldier
in the country out to collect,

490
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,898
I can readily understand
the colonel's reluctance

491
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,232
to admit
to his identity.

492
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,067
Haven't seen one of these
for years.

493
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,702
A useful gun in its day,

494
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:35,473
but like its owner,
no longer much good in a fight.

495
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:38,643
Tell me about Lisa Roselle.

496
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,747
Oh, you know it's very odd

497
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,516
that you should be so curious
about Lisa Roselle.

498
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,118
She's a beautiful woman.

499
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,686
Oh, come, come, sir.

500
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,721
I'll wager at my age
you'd be equally curious.

501
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:54,058
I say it's odd
because this Lisa Roselle

502
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,293
is within
the framework

503
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,528
of all the wickedness
that threatens us.

504
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,564
There's a scoundrel
named Henderson

505
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,066
who proposes to run us
out of the country

506
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,501
and take over
our mines.

507
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:07,004
Operating for him here
is this Lisa Roselle

508
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,073
and her crew
of bullyboys--

509
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,542
Deputy Sheriff Travis
and his men.

510
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,778
What do you know
about her?

511
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,012
Very little,

512
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:18,449
except that she's
a New Orleans
adventuress,

513
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,284
clever
and unscrupulous.

514
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,319
Quite a woman.

515
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:22,486
And quite an idea.

516
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,790
Yeah, that's part
of our trouble.

517
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,359
Travis and the others
we can handle, maybe,

518
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:32,496
but how does one
fight a woman?

519
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,232
Women are difficult,
sir,

520
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,833
but not invulnerable.

521
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,034
Somewhere along
the line

522
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,269
there's always
a weak spot

523
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,470
in their
fortifications

524
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,706
and to find it requires
vast experience.

525
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,640
But having found it,

526
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,375
they'll fold up
like army tents.

527
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,777
You certainly seem
to know your business.

528
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,614
And I might add that
their final capitulation

529
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,117
is always fraught
with the most charming
possibilities.

530
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,419
But one question,
sir.

531
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,787
Why am I being haunted

532
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,024
by the ghost of this...
this Colonel Desmond?

533
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,559
It's the simple arithmetic

534
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,794
of violence and oppression,
Mr. Carter.

535
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,564
My men are being killed
in the mines,

536
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,899
shot to death taking ore
to Mesa City--

537
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,302
the only smelter
that'll handle it.

538
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,105
They're panicked,
ready to quit.

539
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,773
They need a man who'll put heart

540
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,974
and guts into them,

541
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:20,244
a man strong enough
to blast Travis
and his men.

542
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:22,046
They need a leader.

543
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,616
Mr. Carter, won't you help us?

544
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,817
<i>Me?</i>

545
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:30,087
A vaudeville performer,
a trick-shot artist?

546
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,522
What chance
would I have

547
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,224
with a box
of toy pistols

548
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:34,892
against Travis
and his guns?

549
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:37,194
Besides, I'm
a man of peace.

550
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,963
I abominate
violence.

551
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,098
I'm sorry, sir.

552
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,434
I wish I could have helped you.

553
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,802
Good night.

554
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,745
I thought I heard voices.

555
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,213
You did.

556
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,648
(<i> Carter whistling outside</i> )

557
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,420
(<i> horse and carriage</i>
<i>thumps away</i> )

558
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,622
Tom used to sing that.

559
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,658
He was singing it
the last time he rode away.

560
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,826
Was that Tom's brother?

561
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,761
Was it Colonel Desmond,
Grandpa?

562
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:11,796
Was it?

563
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:12,830
I don't know.

564
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,998
I don't know.

565
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,834
Well, did you warn him
about the Yankee lieutenant?

566
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,770
Why, no, I didn't.

567
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,623
Anything I can do,
ma'am?

568
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,526
Oh, I... I was looking
for Mr. Bixby.

569
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,730
Well, you'd hardly expect
to find him in there.

570
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,431
That, I suppose, is
meant to be amusing.

571
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,866
Oh, I'm a very
amusing fellow.

572
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,700
Oh.

573
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,068
Here,
let me show you.

574
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,270
Here you are.

575
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,473
Are you interested
in pistols?

576
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,474
Not in the least.

577
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,675
Well,
that's too bad.

578
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,111
We might've had
something in common.

579
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:01,545
You know,
personally, I think

580
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,748
there are
only three things
worth living for--

581
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,350
fine guns, good horses
and beautiful women.

582
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,285
At least that's one item
we have in common.

583
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:09,320
Would you be
kind enough

584
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:10,621
to let me
get out of here?

585
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:12,156
Well, the obvious
answer to that, ma'am,

586
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,290
is why did you come in?

587
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,292
I told you I came
to see Mr. Bixby.

588
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:16,360
Oh, yes, Mr. Bixby.

589
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,428
That's right.

590
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,829
Well, as an excuse,
ma'am,

591
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,998
that has a faint odorant
of fish.

592
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,266
You're impossible.

593
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:25,069
At least it entitles me
to a question.

594
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,971
Is this your
establishment?

595
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,208
Why do you ask?

596
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,044
Well, if it isn't, it's an awful
waste of something or other

597
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,013
for such an attractive woman
to be here.

598
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:39,917
Oh, well,
it is not my establishment.

599
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,986
Oh.

600
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,354
What are you doing here?

601
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,790
That is none of your business.

602
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,892
TRAVIS:
Well, now, maybe
it is, Lisa.

603
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,995
Maybe he's the fellow
we've been hearing about--

604
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,329
the Reb colonel.

605
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,731
I wouldn't try
any monkeyshines

606
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,399
with those cap pistols
of yours.

607
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,268
Wouldn't think
of it.

608
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,436
Besides,
I should tell you

609
00:23:58,438 --> 00:23:59,737
that you've
been misinformed

610
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:00,838
about my military rank.

611
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,239
It's Corporal
Johnny Carter.

612
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,775
Corporal or colonel,
I got a piece of advice.

613
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,745
I wouldn't mix in things
that don't concern you.

614
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,612
Why not?

615
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,147
We don't like
troublemakers.

616
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,516
We got a nice
little community here,

617
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,285
chock-full of law and order,

618
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,320
and we aim
to keep it that way.

619
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,721
We?

620
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,857
Mr. Travis
is from the sheriff's office.

621
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:22,560
Oh, well, now, I'm all in favor
of law and order.

622
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,861
TRAVIS:
I'm glad to hear that,

623
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,162
because if you wasn't,

624
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,097
I might start remembering
I never did like

625
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,132
Rebs anyhow.

626
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,166
(<i> gun fires</i> )

627
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:31,969
Now we can talk
more sociable.

628
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,004
That was quite a shot,
Mr. Carter.

629
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,339
Yes, it was...

630
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,607
quite a shot.

631
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,008
It's my business--

632
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,646
eyes closed, mirrors,
upside down.

633
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,515
You take one
of these things,

634
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,251
liable to kill people--
that's no good.

635
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,385
Here, take it.

636
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,787
I never liked them

637
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,988
because when you
kill a man,

638
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,723
he dies just as bad
or just as stupid

639
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,525
as the moment you put
the bullet in him.

640
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:55,793
But if you let
him live,

641
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,528
he's still got a chance
to learn things.

642
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,863
Well, that's smart,

643
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,932
provided he learns
the right things.

644
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,469
Take what I just learned.

645
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,972
You're as full of tricks
as a tame crow,

646
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,907
but tricks don't mean much
in a showdown.

647
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,977
Face to face,
it's speed--

648
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:16,547
how quick you can throw out
pieces of lead like this.

649
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,015
Yeah,
that's a point.

650
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,450
Ma'am.

651
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:20,751
Yes.

652
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,553
I hope you'll honor
my performance

653
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,588
with your presence this evening.

654
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,793
I think I will.

655
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,030
How about you?

656
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,698
I'll be there.

657
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,871
MAN:
You reminded me
of the old lady.

658
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,507
All right,
all right.

659
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,610
Well, Mrs. Desmond, are
you here for the show?

660
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,778
No, I'm not.

661
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,046
If it's a church
benefit,

662
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,181
I've got tickets coming
out of my ears.

663
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,149
Oh, no, it isn't.

664
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,984
I came to see one
of the entertainers.

665
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,553
By the name of Carter,
I'll bet.

666
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,054
Why,
how did you know?

667
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,523
Oh, I had a husband once
looked something like him.

668
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,659
Drawed gals the way
molasses does flies.

669
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:02,860
He's in there
by the stage

670
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,328
getting ready
for his act.

671
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,396
Could I speak
to him?

672
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,463
Sure,
go right ahead.

673
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,565
Thank you.

674
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:14,004
(<i> crowd merrily conversing,</i>
<i>piano playing</i> )

675
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,673
Mr. Carter.

676
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:16,941
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,542
Could I speak to you
for a moment?

678
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,344
Why, certainly.

679
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,545
I'm Mrs. Desmond...

680
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,014
Mrs. Thomas Desmond.

681
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,316
How do you do?

682
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,085
Well, perhaps the name
doesn't mean anything to you,

683
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,454
but if it does,
I... I just want to warn you.

684
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:31,722
There's trouble here--

685
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:35,092
a Union officer
looking for Colonel Desmond.

686
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,427
A Union officer?

687
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,695
Yes, sir.

688
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,496
Could that be the one
standing there?

689
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,498
Your bet.

690
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,800
Oh, dear,
I'd better go.

691
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,568
Oh, not on my account,
please.

692
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,337
No, really,
I'd better leave.

693
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,476
Hey, ain't you going

694
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,211
the wrong way,
sweetheart?

695
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,112
I'm going out.

696
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,581
Hey, come on, have
a drink with me.

697
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,716
Please, let me go!

698
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,184
Oh, come on.

699
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,686
Oh, come on,
princess,

700
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,121
we got business
at the bar.

701
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:04,722
Let me go!

702
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:05,923
Why be so stubborn?

703
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:06,790
Please!

704
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,192
A couple of
drinks won't...

705
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,868
I'd count it a privilege,
Mrs. Desmond,

706
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,603
if you'd let me
escort you home.

707
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,772
Why, I appreciate
your kindness, Lieutenant...

708
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,707
If it's not wanting
to be seen with me,

709
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,209
well, I can walk
ten paces behind.

710
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,177
I don't suppose even
your grandfather

711
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,178
would object to that.

712
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,349
No, I... I don't
suppose he would.

Lisa.

00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:11,782
Come in.

728
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,885
Well.

729
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,253
Do you like my dress?

730
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,856
This time I'm asking
permission.

731
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,291
And again you're
being refused.

732
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,131
Couldn't be you're dressing up
for that Carter?

733
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:30,134
I always like to look
as well as possible.

734
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,469
What do you make
of him, Lisa?

735
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,271
I don't know.

736
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,072
Why?

737
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,173
Kind of like
to find out

738
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,708
if he's up
to anything or not.

739
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,076
Why not wait
and see?

740
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,744
Well, I'll tell you,
not waiting

741
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,613
is the main reason
I'm around today.

742
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,981
Found that out
during the war,

743
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,516
when it was shoot
or get shot.

744
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:46,884
Found out a lot
of things.

745
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:49,920
Take what the fellow said
about not killing people

746
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:50,954
so they can learn.

747
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,156
He's wrong.

748
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,457
Is he?

749
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,726
The important thing
is to stay alive
so you can learn.

750
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:56,760
That sounds
reasonable.

751
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,629
It is.

752
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,330
And I'll tell you an even
more reasonable thing
I found out.

753
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,498
What?

754
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,200
You never have
to dodge bullets

755
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:04,034
from a dead man.

756
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,335
You're being
too serious

757
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,905
for a man who's come
to take me downstairs.

And now, to assist me in my
final and most prodigious feat,

764
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,360
I need the services
of a volunteer.

765
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,361

766
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,362

768
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,232
Professor,
would you oblige?

769
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,033
Yeah.

770
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:37,034

BIXBY:
I guarantee you won't get hurt.

773
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:41,738
I hope his eyes
are in good shape.

(<i> laughter and applause</i> )

00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:48,946
I... I won't
get killed, will I?

776
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,547
Not this time.

777
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,182
Just stand there.

778
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,318
Take this ball
in your right hand

779
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,819
and hold it up.

Just hold it there.

784
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,429
Now, with this small
caliber pistol...

785
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,834
and with the aid
of this mirror,

786
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,503
I shall endeavor
to smash the globe.

788
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:15,706
Yeah?

789
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,874
I shall count three,

790
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,342
and on the word "three,"
I shall fire.

791
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,278
You... you'll count to three?

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,279
Yes.

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,949
Are you ready?

794
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:29,720
Oh... uh, yes.

795
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,889
One, two...

797
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,897
Quite a shot.

00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,865
Kinda evens the score,
doesn't it, Carter?

799
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,300
It does indeed.

Thank you,

805

By the way,
would you like

806
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,749
to become a permanent
member of the troupe?

807
00:31:58,751 --> 00:31:59,750
I, uh...

808
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:00,918
I see your point.

809
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,352
Ladies
and gentlemen,

810
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,087
it seems that
my performance
this evening

811
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,422
has been
concluded for me.

812
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:13,096
Miss Roselle, may I have
the honor of joining you?

813
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:14,898
If you like.

814
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,066
Thank you.

815
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,734
Suppose one of
those toy guns of yours

816
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,002
could sting
a man a little.

817
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,704
Oh, kill him
in the right place.

818
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:21,738
Think so?

819
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,073
I do.

820
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,908
Ma'am, you look as if
you'd just stepped

821
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,243
from a Mardi Gras
cotillion.

822
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,378
You've been
in New Orleans?

823
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,579
My favorite city.

824
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:30,580
I was there once.

825
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,682
Never liked it myself.

826
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,050
Well, perhaps
you didn't go

827
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,651
to the right places.

828
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,154
Do you remember those
wonderful restaurants,

829
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,922
charming people,
the Comus Ball?

830
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,791
How does a
vaudeville performer

831
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,392
happen to attend
a Comus Ball?

832
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,395
Oh, vaudeville
performers enjoy
such things, ma'am.

833
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,297
They enjoy good food,
pleasant surroundings,

834
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,333
dancing and...
beautiful ladies.

835
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,134
If that's
the case,

836
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,136
what are you
doing here?

837
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,838
Talking to
a beautiful lady.

838
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,239
Well, that I grant.

839
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,408
But if you can perform
in such fancy places,

840
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,576
why Coppertown?

841
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,844
As I told Miss Roselle,

842
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,446
I was persuaded to come.

843
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,114
A while ago,
I was talking to Bixby.

844
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,216
He was wondering how you
happened to be so handy

845
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,851
when his Italian singer
walked out.

846
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,687
Says it wasn't five minutes
later that you showed up.

847
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:11,922
BAT:
Travis?

848
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,490
Yeah?

849
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,361
They're comin',
just down the street.

850
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,597
Maybe we can talk
some more later.

851
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,569
Your friend
doesn't seem to like me.

852
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:26,903
No, he doesn't.

853
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:28,305
That's odd.

854
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,806
But then,
you're odd, too.

855
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:32,843
You wondered how I
happened to attend
a Comus Ball.

856
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,644
I might ask you
the same thing.

857
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,049
I never have.

858

Travis...

861
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,540
Keep away from me.

862
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,509
Is there going to be
any trouble?

863
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,078
You heard what I said--
keep away from me.

864
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,055
We'd better
stay out of this.

865
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,123
Come on.

866
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,293
Now's the time to make
your play, Colonel,

867
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,062
with that fancy
shootin' of yours...

868
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,430
while they
ain't expectin' it.

869
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,731
My gun's
right by your hand.

870
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,000
No, I don't hold
with violence, Sergeant.

871
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:32,769
I reckon I got
the wrong man.

872
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,212
Where's Travis?

873

(<i> piano music fades and stops</i> )

874
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,185
Right over here, Bassett.

875
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,262
I come
to give you warnin', Travis.

876
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,298
Do you hear me?

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,999
I've come to give you warnin'.

878
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,468
Go ahead.

00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,303
If you ain't
out of town by sunup,

880
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,839
I aim to hunt you down
and shoot you with this...

882
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,892
Professor, play some music,
and play it loud and fast.

883
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:29,826
Calm down.

Lisa.

886
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,306
You saw what happened--
strictly self-defense.

887
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,710
I saw three men
shot in the back.

888

send someone down here

to investigate.

892
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,685
Then where'll
you and Lisa be

893
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,420
with your copper mines?

I wish I could
change your mind.

895
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,463
But what have I
to stay for now?

896
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,298
They're all gone,

897
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,400
all of them except
the youngest here.

898
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,935
I'm takin' him
back home,

899
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:13,270
where he'll
have a chance

900
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,372
to learn how people
can live together

901
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,007
without killin'
each other.

902
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,475
But Mrs. Bassett,
I've got a plan

903
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,443
for getting the ore
through to Mesa City.

904
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,913
Now, if you and the others
will only wait a few days.

905
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:26,249
We've waited too long
already, Mr. Roberts.

906
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,484
Good-bye.

907
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,885
Good-bye,
Mrs. Bassett.

908
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,086
Good-bye, Rufe.

909
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,188
Good-bye.

910
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,290
LIEUTENANT:
Sergeant, take charge.

911
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,658
All right, son.

912
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,728
I'm, uh...
I'm deeply obliged

913
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,897
to you, Lieutenant,
for giving them escort.

914
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,333
Well, I'm glad to be
of some assistance, sir.

915
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,334
Good day, ma'am.

916
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,735
Good day,
Lieutenant,

917
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,736
and thank you.

918
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,171
Unless my plan works,

919
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,141
the others are going
to be leaving, too.

920
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:53,610
Scamper, I want you
to get to town.

921
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,812
Take a message to Mr. Carter.

922
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:56,613
I'll get it there

923
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,248
just as fast
as I can, sir.

924
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,918
ROBERTS:
You see, it's less than 30 miles
to Mesa City.

925
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,956
Not much of a haul, provided
nobody tries to stop the ore.

926
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,625
I was going to have the men
start at daybreak.

927
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,360
By nightfall they'd be there.

928
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:13,363
Then as soon as it was dark,
they were to double back

929
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,632
and cut off
onto the Old Red Creek Trail.

930
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,001
Yes, but look, Red Creek Trail
runs mostly in a canyon.

931
00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:19,736
There's a dozen places
for an ambush.

932
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,205
A scout could bring the men
over from the main road

933
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,974
in plenty of time
to catch the wagons.

934
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:24,975
What would you do?

935
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:25,976
I'd go the regular way.

936
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,510
Look at the terrain--

937
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,980
there's only one place
for an attack, right here.

938
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,281
ROBERTS:
But an attack is what

939
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,649
we're trying to avoid.

940
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,351
Sure, but if one comes,
you'll be fighting it

941
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,619
on ground of your
own choosing.

942
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,686
Still,
leaving at daybreak

943
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,887
would get them there
after dark

944
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,689
and that's no time
to be ambushed.

945
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,124
Well, let everyone think
you're leaving at daybreak,

946
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:42,292
then leave at midnight.

947
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,327
Might even get through
without a fight.

948
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,496
If we follow your plan,
Mr. Carter,

949
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,498
will you consent
to come along?

950
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,434
Well, I... I'll
be wishing you success.

951
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,669
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

952
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,738
I've got to get
back to the Rainbow.

953
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,240
You're leaving us now?

954
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:59,309
Yes, I have
some work to do.

955
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,945
He's got some work to do.

956
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,179
Good-bye
and good luck.

957
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,848
It was a mistake
asking him here.

958
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,951
NEWTON:
His plan doesn't sound so bad,
but after all...

959
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:08,952
By golly,
I got it.

960
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,253
What?

961
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,488
Know how
Colonel Desmond won

962
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,789
the Battle
of Maple Ridge?
No.

963
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,658
Let it be known
he'd attack at daybreak

964
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,159
and then hit 'em
at midnight.

965
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,861
The same thing.

966
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,729
Just about time.

967
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,072
Well, hello, Travis.

968
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,774
Hello.

969
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,910
It couldn't be the 31st
of February, could it?

970
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,314
Do you think
it ever will be?

971
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,381
What do you think?

972
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,050
I'll tell
you what I think:

973
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,318
She's no good for you.

974
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,286
You two don't
belong together.

975
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,155
You're different...

976
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,956
like whiskey
and champagne.

977
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,391
I'll be seeing you.

978
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,961
Cora... any day
of the month

979
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,596
is all right
with me.

980
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,714
Still set
for midnight?

981
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,115
Yeah.

982
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,617
They're still figurin'
on him goin' along.

983
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,052
All right, get going.

984
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,925
Do you want your dress
now, Miss Lisa?

985
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,927
Yes, please.

986
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,029
TRAVIS:
Lisa?

987
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,631
I thought I told you
not to come up here.

988
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,401
Just wanted to talk to you
about your elegant friend.

989
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,169
Seems he's got
the Rebs convinced

990
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,637
he's Colonel Desmond.

991
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,477
What do you mean?

992
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,178
He's taking charge
of their ore train.

993
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,279
Changed their plans

994
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,614
so they're leaving
at midnight,

995
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,249
and told them
he'd ride with them.

996
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,384
Where'd you find
that out?

997
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,451
Oh, I got
friends around.

998
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:49,652
Thought
you'd be interested

999
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,287
in how he pulled
the wool over your eyes.

1000
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,789
But don't worry...

1001
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,824
I'm meeting them
with a dozen men
instead of three.

1002
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,427
This is supposed to be
a business, not a war.

1003
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,497
Mr. Henderson's orders were
only to watch and to report.

1004
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,932
And make sure the Rebs
don't get prosperous.

1005
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,033
Yes, but in a legal way.

1006
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,403
Nothing was said
about using violence.

1007
00:40:06,405 --> 00:40:07,937
Now, Lisa...

1008
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,407
All we're going to do
is scare 'em a little...

1009
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,508
them and your friend.

1010
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,609
What about him?

1011
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,077
The Rebs might make
a fight of it

1012
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,078
if he's along.

1013
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,279
Wouldn't do...

1014
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:17,547
not when they're
on their last legs.

1015
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,682
Best thing
is to convince
him not to go.

1016
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,317
It's going
to be interesting

1017
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,653
to see how he acts
when the chips are down.

1018
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,789
Heard tell he was
a regular fire-eater.

1019
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,290
What are you
going to do?

1020
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,892
Depends on
what he does.

1021
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,860
How come
you're so worried?

1022
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:34,063
Couldn't be you're
soft on him,
could it?

1023
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,932
No, I'm not soft on him.

1024
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,202
Well, that's good, because
I wouldn't like to think

1025
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,572
of your grieving over him...
case he gets hurt.

1026
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:47,110
(<i> fast music playing</i> )

1027
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,949
(<i> cheering</i> )

1028
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,695
(<i> music slows</i> )

1029
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,964
(<i> cheering</i> )

1030
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:12,402
(<i> music ends</i> )

1031
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:15,171
(<i> cheering</i> )

1032
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,546
Evening, Sheriff.

1033
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:24,647
Seems like you
enjoyed the show.

1034
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,849
Oh, that I did.

1035
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,450
And I enjoyed your
act, too, Mr. Carter.

1036
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:28,685
You know everybody's
talking about

1037
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:29,686
how wonderful you are.

1038
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,687
Thank you, Sheriff.

1039
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:31,688
You know,
I heard something

1040
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,922
about you today, too,

1041
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,290
but, of course,
I didn't believe it.

1042
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,291
Huh?

1043
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,559
What did you hear?

1044
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,061
Well, I heard that you had
absolutely no say

1045
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,829
in appointing
those deputies of yours,

1046
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,398
that Travis and the others
just walked into your office

1047
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,867
and pinned the stars
on themselves.

1048
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,034
Wasn't
that way at all.

1049
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,070
I got well paid
for takin' em on.

1050
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,808
Well, I guess
certain people

1051
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,109
got a lot
of money to spend.

1052
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,410
Yes, they have.

1053
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,947
Guess they got a right
to spend it any way they...

1054
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,316
Say... why are you
so interested?

1055
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,851
Oh, just
idle conversation.

1056
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,852
Yeah?

1057
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,653
Hello, Lisa.

1058
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,854
Want to play?

1059
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:05,655
No cheating?

1060
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,123
All right.

1061
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,429
Ma'am, you're as lustrous
as Cinderella tonight,

1062
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,032
but unlike her, you<i> appear</i>
at the stroke of 12:00.

1063
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,667
I hope I don't
disappoint you.

1064
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:19,202
On the contrary.

1065
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,538
You're mighty glib with those
pretty speeches of yours.

1066
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,472
Where'd you get 'em?

1067
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:23,339
Oh, make 'em up.

1068
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,707
That's interesting,

1069
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,442
because I've kinda taken
a dislike to 'em.

1070
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:27,644
Many people have.

1071
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:28,778
And to you, too.

1072
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,013
That's not impossible.

1073
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,315
Don't provoke easy, do you?

1074
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:34,217
No.

1075
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,085
Maybe this'll do it.

1076
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Can I borrow your
handkerchief, Sheriff?

1077
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,366
Thank you.

1078
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,935
Now, if you people
will excuse me,

1079
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:54,103
I have several things
to take care of.

1080
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:55,772
Good night.

1081
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,843
I gave him his chance.

1082
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,512
What are you
going to do

1083
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:04,147
with somebody
like that?

1084
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:05,815
I think I know.

1085
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,954
You think
this'll hold him?

1086
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:14,557
Yes... with a little help
from me.

1087
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,359
I don't like
this idea of yours,

1088
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:17,927
but I guess it'll do.

1089
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,796
The ore train
starts at midnight.

1090
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,065
We'll have to leave
by 3:00 at the latest

1091
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:23,700
if we're gonna
head 'em off.

1092
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,401
How'll I know
if he's here?

1093
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,170
I'll signal
from the window.

1094
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,204
At 3:00.

1095
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:29,439
At 3:00.

1096
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:32,809
Don't forget--
this is business,
not pleasure.

1097
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:35,144
I won't forget.

1098
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,382
Ten past 12:00.

1099
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:40,483
We'd better be startin'.

1100
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,051
But Carter
ain't here yet.

1101
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,454
Likely he's plannin'
to join us along the way.

1102
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:46,322
Give 'em the word, Zack.

1103
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,092
Let's get in the wagons.

1104
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,162
Hey, Bill, do me
a favor, will you?

1105
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,530
What is it?

1106
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:55,965
Take this critter
to Mesa City

1107
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,467
and find somebody
to have him

1108
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,668
for five dollars.

1109
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,236
Who'll pay five dollars
for that?

1110
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:01,170
Who said "pay"?

1111
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,505
The five's
for takin' him!

1112
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:03,873
That's a lot of money.

1113
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,608
Not alongside of
the baccy I'd save!

1114
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,143
All right,
I'll take him.

1115
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,345
MAN:
Head on!

1116
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:12,982
(<i> donkey braying</i> )

1117
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,354
More of that
champagne stuff.

1118
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,789
They must be washing in it!

1119
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,257
Nothing wrong
with that.

1120
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:28,097
(<i> knock at door</i> )

1121
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:28,998
Come in.

1122
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,500
Well,
look who's back,

1123
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,335
my friend,
the champagne man!

1124
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,703
Put it right down here.

1125
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:36,105
And accept this
with my compliments.

1126
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:36,906
Thank you.

1127
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:37,974
You want
any more, Lisa?

1128
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,509
This will be enough,
thank you.

1129
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,110
There is never enough!

1130
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,513
As the poet Horace said,
"From Sabine jars

1131
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:45,048
bring forth
the sparkling wine."

1132
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,616
But we have
no Sabine jars.

1133
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,584
No matter,
no matter at all.

1134
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,653
Ma'am,
it's very interesting,

1135
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:53,589
the things you told me
about New Orleans.

1136
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,824
I guess
it must have been

1137
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,492
pretty bad there
after the war.

1138
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,860
It was.

1139
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,830
I bet you could've married
a rich carpetbagger.

1140
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:04,400
Maybe, or maybe
I could have become
a seamstress.

1141
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:06,202
But I preferred
coming west.

1142
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,738
I really wanted to go
to San Francisco.

1143
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,440
Oh, why?

1144
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,341
I was told about
a building there

1145
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:16,546
that could have been
made into a theater
for plays, or even opera,

1146
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:19,082
but that required $20,000.

1147
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:22,385
Well, I'd hardly
think Coppertown
would be the place

1148
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,020
to get that
kind of money.

1149
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:28,224
You know, I've been telling
you my life history,

1150
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,226
and you haven't said
a thing about yourself.

1151
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,528
Oh, it's a very
dull subject, ma'am.

1152
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,697
The history of
a trick-shot artist?

1153
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,365
It's filled
with such things

1154
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,402
as gunpowder, bullets,
trajectory, recoil.

1155
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:48,444
I'm sure we can think
of something livelier.

1156
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:53,850
For instance?

1157
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:56,519
Well, I could tell you,
and in great sincerity,

1158
00:45:56,521 --> 00:46:00,423
that you're one of
the two most beautiful
women I've ever met.

1159
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,657
Who is the other?

1160
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,560
Ah-ah, that's not
a sporting question.

1161
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:05,928
Why not?

1162
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,230
Well, one of these times

1163
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:09,499
I'm going to meet
another beautiful woman

1164
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,134
and I'm going
to say to her,

1165
00:46:11,136 --> 00:46:14,637
"I think that you're one
of the three most
beautiful women

1166
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,038
I've ever met."

1167
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,875
And she'll say to me,
"Who were the other two?"

1168
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:20,810
And how would you like it
if I said,

1169
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,311
"Oh, Miss What's-Her-Name

1170
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,381
and an angel out of heaven
named Lisa Roselle."

1171
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:26,415
(<i> chuckles</i> )

1172
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,151
There's nothing wrong
in saying that.

1173
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,453
Ah, well, it isn't
what I say,

1174
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,155
it's the way I say it.

1175
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,859
Am I still being dull?

1176
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,462
Mmm... amateurish,
I'd say.

1177
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,797
Mmm.

1178
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,402
Still amateurish?

1179
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,371
Well...

1180
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:56,512
(<i> clock chimes three times</i> )

1181
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,580
Three o'clock.

1182
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:02,018
Oh, yes... 3:00.

1183
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,788
Where are you going?

1184
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,724
My... my maid is
in the other room.

1185
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:10,393
Well, send her away.

1186
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,262
Yes.

1187
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,866
I'll have another
little pick-me-up.

1188
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,917
I think it would be nice...

is the only way
we can beat them.

Too many of them otherwise.

1204

and drew them off.

We'll follow him

So he was smart enough
to stake out another horse.

Good morning.

1217

Good morning.

Nice day for shopping,
isn't it?

1219
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,526
Yes, isn't it?

1220
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,262
Why, he didn't go.

1221
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:54,530
That's very strange.

1222
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:55,998
I heard the rumors, too.

1223
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,701
Heard he was leading
the ore train as
Colonel Desmond.

1224
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:01,403
Well, he doesn't act
like Colonel Desmond.

1225
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,484
Hello.

1226
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,353
This is an unexpected
pleasure, ma'am.

1227
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:20,055
Hardly expected you
to be up before noon.

1228
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,290
Where have you been?

1229
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,458
Oh, out strolling.

1230
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,626
It's nice out.

1231
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,961
I mean last night,
after you left me.

1232
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:26,895
Why, in bed, ma'am.

1233
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:27,830
Where else?

1234
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:30,199
I told you champagne
makes me sleepy.

You're lying.

1236
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:32,301
I was in here.

1237
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,503
I was in here
a dozen times!

1238
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:35,304
Oh.

1239
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,439
Too bad I missed you.

1240
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,908
Should have told you,
though--

1241
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,010
I walk in my sleep.

1242
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:43,846
You met up with that
ore train, didn't you?

1243
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:44,546
Didn't you?

1244
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:46,115
Ah-ah, temper, temper.

00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,651
You don't want
to get lines under
those beautiful eyes.

1246
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:50,786
You fool!

1247
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,988
Save that grin
for the undertaker!

1248
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,399
Oh, Johnny!

1249
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,701
Johnny, it's no good
for you here,

1250
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,069
no good at all.

1251
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:10,539
The hours I've been waiting,
knowing where you've gone!

1252
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,641
They're too much
for you, too many.

1253
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,877
You saw what
they did to Bassett--

1254
00:55:14,879 --> 00:55:16,145
shot him in the back.

1255
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:18,013
And they'll do
the same to you.

1256
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,683
If it isn't Travis,
it'll be some Yankee soldier.

1257
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:23,485
They'll shoot you
for a thousand-dollar reward.

1258
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,288
See, Johnny,
I know who you are.

1259
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,891
You... you must go now!

1260
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,160
Oh...

1261
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,295
I must go.

1262
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,563
So that's it?

1263
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,567
It took you long enough
to make the point,

1264
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,736
but you finally got there.

1265
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,671
And believe me, it was
quite an oration.

1266
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,407
For a while there,
you had me on your side.

1267
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:50,012
Johnny, it isn't what
you're thinking at all.

1268
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,513
It's just that I...

1269
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:54,917
You don't trust me!

1270
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:58,153
You think it's
a trick to get you
away, don't you?

1271
00:55:58,155 --> 00:55:59,888
Johnny, you've
got to leave!

1272
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,923
Or otherwise?

1273
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,160
Guess we finally
caught up, Carter.

1274
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:06,695
Stand away
from him, Lisa.

1275
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,005
What'd you do
with your rifle?

1276
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:17,806
Rifle?

1277
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,341
Don't happen
to have one.

1278
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:20,576
You did
this morning.

1279
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,344
You'd better break
down and admit it.

1280
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:24,346
I'd be glad to, if I had
anything to admit.

1281
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:25,347
How about it, Lisa?

1282
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,249
When did
he come in?

1283
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,584
When did
he come in?!

1284
00:56:28,586 --> 00:56:30,986
He hasn't left
the hotel all night.

1285
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:33,956
BAT:
Travis.

1286
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,624
What do you want?

1287
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:38,927
Mr. Henderson wants
to talk to you<i> now.</i>

1288
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,596
Mr. Henderson?

1289
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:41,997
Yes, he just
got here

1290
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:45,401
and he'll be wanting
to talk to you, too.

1291
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:49,571
Don't you worry,
Mr. Carter...

1292
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,907
I'm going to get
around to you yet.

1293
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:00,382
Thanks for what
you did for me.

1294
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:02,618
But it doesn't
make sense...

1295
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,153
any sense at all.

1296
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,327
We leased this hotel and saloon,
put you in charge,

1297
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:15,130
and engaged Mr. Travis
and his men to assist you,

1298
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,765
all at considerable
expense.

1299
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,001
We did this
to secure the mines.

1300
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:20,769
I know, Mr. Henderson.

1301
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,337
Now we learn
a consignment of ore

1302
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:23,705
has slipped through
to Mesa City,

1303
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:24,773
and that there's dissension

1304
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,375
between you
and Mr. Travis.

1305
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:30,179
There is dissension, because
I object to the use of violence!

1306
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:32,848
Well, one could hardly refer
to the actions

1307
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,451
of the constituted authorities
as violence.

1308
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:37,119
I can and I do,

1309
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,622
and so will the governor if
I'm forced to appeal to him.

1310
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,358
Appeal to the governor!

1311
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,726
Come, come, Miss Roselle,

1312
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:46,428
isn't that rather
a dangerous thing to do?

1313
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,096
Surely you must realize

1314
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:51,834
that for whatever has happened
here-- for whatever violence--

1315
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:54,002
you are equally responsible
with us.

1316
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,270
And another thing--

1317
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:58,273
by the terms
of our agreement,
it was specifically...

1318
00:57:58,275 --> 00:57:59,942
I remember perfectly.

1319
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:03,645
It was specifically agreed
that whatever was to be done

1320
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,582
was to be done peacefully,
without violence...

1321
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:08,083
without bloodshed!

1322
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,886
You haven't kept your promise,
Mr. Henderson.

1323
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,555
Wait a moment.

1324
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:16,692
Doesn't it seem
a pity, with your job
so nearly finished,

1325
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:19,294
that you should
sacrifice the money
we guaranteed you?

1326
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,531
After all, you know,
you still have
your obligations.

1327
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,600
It seems I haven't
made myself clear.

1328
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:25,868
I'll put it this way.

1329
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,403
You have failed to live up
to your promises.

1330
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,539
From now on, I feel
perfectly justified

1331
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:32,207
if I fail to live up
to mine.

1332
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:36,612
Don't give her a thought.

1333
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:38,013
You know how women are.

1334
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,948
There isn't much more
Lisa could do anyways.

1335
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,617
Time has come for me
to take over.

1336
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:42,951
Leave it to me
and by tomorrow,

1337
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,020
we'll have these Rebs
on the run.

1338
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:47,022
Look, here's how
it's going to be--

1339
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,690
tonight's big doin's--
a dance.

1340
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,058
The whole town
will be there.

1341
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,027
Well, it's going
to be this easy.

01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,391
The ore's sold,
and the wagons are
on the way back.

1416
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:37,726
That's wonderful!

1417
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,261
We got $1,600
for it.

1418
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:41,530
Took it to your house
for safekeeping--

1419
01:01:41,532 --> 01:01:43,065
figured you'd
divide it tomorrow.

1420
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:45,434
It'll be the greatest
pleasure of my life.

1421
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:47,903
We'll tell the folks right now.

1422
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:00,248
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen--

1423
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,850
an announcement!

1424
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:06,421
Our ore has reached
the smelter at Mesa City

1425
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,424
and has been sold for $1,600!

1426
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:13,462
(<i> cheering</i> )

1427
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:14,463
Any sign of him?

1428
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:15,464
Of who?

1429
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:17,466
Mr. Roberts, naturally.

1430
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:18,800
Oh, no, not yet.

1431
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:20,969
He'll be along
pretty soon, though.

1432
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:24,172
Sure rejoice to get all
this money off my hands.

1433
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,174
Yeah, it's a lot of money.

1434
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,811
We're going to get more,
lots more, the same way.

1435
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:31,413
About time our jinx
was broken.

1436
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,715
Another week and I wouldn't
have been eatin'...

1437
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:35,050
(<i> thud</i> )

1438
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:39,287
Where's the money?

1439
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:45,794
Thanks.

1440
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,163
What's the matter,
Travis?

1441
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,799
You been in a fight,
tryin' to protect the money.

1442
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:58,507
Why I haven't got
a hole in my skull,
I'll never know.

1443
01:02:58,509 --> 01:02:59,875
How long were
you unconscious?

1444
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:01,376
Must have been
at least an hour.

1445
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:03,945
Oh, that's why Miss Roselle
couldn't find you.

1446
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,480
She's been up here
several times.

1447
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,048
She has?

1448
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,450
Oh!

1449
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,852
Now, there's a gal that's
as smooth as a wet eel,

1450
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:12,320
but a lot easier to look at.

1451
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:16,057
Looks like we got
here just in time.

1452
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,826
Didn't think
we'd move so
quick, did you?

1453
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:18,960
What are you
talkin' about?

1454
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,395
See if you
can find
the money.

1455
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:21,396
Just a second!

1456
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:22,397
Take it easy,
Carter.

1457
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:23,899
Guess I'll
have to.

1458
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,767
Hello, Lisa.

1459
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,302
What's going on?

1460
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,137
Suppose you tell me!

1461
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,206
Johnny Carter's
in real trouble.

1462
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:34,176
He took money from
the Southerners-- $1,600.

1463
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,710
I don't believe it!

1464
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:36,778
SHERIFF:
It's true.

1465
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,013
We got a witness!

1466
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:39,247
I got a good look
at him

1467
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,016
just before
he knocked me out.

1468
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,518
Here's the money, Travis.

1469
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,187
Found it in his gun case.

1470
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:47,856
Well, that kind of
clinches it, Lisa.

1471
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:50,258
Looks like Miss Roselle's
at a loss for words,

1472
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,060
although up to now,
I must admit

1473
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:54,229
she's given
a wonderful performance.

1474
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,367
Well, Johnny, I guess you
better pack your things

1475
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,435
and come off to jail.

1476
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,170
You'll like it,
it's real peaceful.

1477
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:06,942
It's easy enough.

1478
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:08,710
I can ride to the fort,
secure a federal warrant

1479
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:10,145
and have you out of here
before dark,

1480
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:11,713
if you'll just admit
you're Colonel Desmond.

1481
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:13,615
I don't see
the percentage in
that, Lieutenant.

1482
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,116
Well, it's better
than being killed.

1483
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,084
In here?

1484
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,285
You wouldn't be
the first prisoner

1485
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:18,920
that's been shot
trying to escape.

1486
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:20,822
CAROLINE:
Can't you just say
you're Tom's brother,

1487
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:21,823
even if you're not?

1488
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:23,291
No, afraid I can't.

1489
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,993
Besides, I'd kind of like
to see that $1,600

1490
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,328
get back to its original owners.

1491
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:28,263
It's odd a man
would worry about that

1492
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:29,965
and not worry
about the $20,000

1493
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:31,633
that was taken
from a federal safe.

1494
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,102
Well, it might be that
the man who took the 20,000

1495
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,171
was just getting back
what was taken from him

1496
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,372
when he was captured.

1497
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:40,308
That could be.

1498
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,144
As far as our money
goes, Mr. Carter,
you can't touch it.

1499
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:44,512
Travis has
impounded it--

1500
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:47,315
says it might be a year
before it's released,

1501
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,150
and even tomorrow
would be too late.

1502
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:51,019
Everybody's packing,
getting ready

1503
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:53,388
to leave this afternoon,
even Grandfather.

1504
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,991
Does Balfour know
you're leaving?

1505
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:57,759
CAROLINE:
I don't know.

1506
01:04:57,761 --> 01:04:59,027
Will you do something for me?

1507
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:00,595
Have him come down here
and see me.

1508
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:01,830
I can try.

1509
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:03,598
I believe I can
persuade him, Mr. Carter.

1510
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,699
Will you do it
right away?

1511
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:05,901
Yes, sir.

1512
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,139
I'd like to escort
you home, ma'am,

1513
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,274
but you understand,

1514
01:05:12,276 --> 01:05:13,708
I'd best ride up
to the smelter.

1515
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,176
If you could help
in any way,

1516
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,678
I... I'd be
eternally grateful.

1517
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,014
That's what
I'm counting on, ma'am.

1518
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:26,621
(<i> hoofbeats receding</i> )

1519
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:33,295
I'm not quitting,
now or later.

1520
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:35,597
The stake's too big
and I'm in too deep.

1521
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,865
And so are you, Lisa.

1522
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:38,433
Whether you like it
or not,

1523
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,502
we're in this
thing together.

1524
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,840
And I've got an idea
you're going to like it,

1525
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:47,108
once Carter's
taken care of.

1526
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,377
You're not doing
anything more to him.

1527
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:50,412
No?

1528
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:52,047
Remember what
I told you once

1529
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,849
about never having
to dodge bullets
from a dead man?

1530
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,918
Well, that still goes.

1531
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,787
We'll see.

1532
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,155
It's no use
going to Henderson.

1533
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,957
As of last night,
I'm in charge here,

1534
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:03,658
and if I have to prove it,
I will.

1535
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,794
(<i> knock on door</i> )

1536
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,462
Who's that?

1537
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,463
It's me.

1538
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,497
What do you want?

1539
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,132
The Desmond girl
and her lieutenant's

1540
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,567
been talkin' to Carter.

1541
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:14,569
Yeah?

1542
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:17,405
Now the lieutenant's
on the way to Balfour.

1543
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,873
Have Bart round up the boys,

1544
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:21,543
then you and I'll ride up
to the smelter...

1545
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,278
just in case.

1546
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:28,283
Don't get in my way,
Lisa.

1547
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:32,787
It says it plain
in the Book, Mr. Carter.

1548
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:35,457
It says, "I will take
all the families
of the North

1549
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,125
"and bring them
against this land

1550
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:38,560
and the inhabitants
thereof."

1551
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,895
It said that about two<i> nations,</i>
<i>Mr. Balfour.</i>

1552
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:42,831
Now, these people
are no different

1553
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,265
than the people of the North.

1554
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:46,201
They worship
the same God,
read the same Bible.

1555
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:47,635
They killed my son.

1556
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:50,638
But they lost sons, too,
and husbands and brothers.

1557
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,075
Oh, I know you feel unhappy
about the Bassetts being killed,

1558
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:57,445
but I'm sure that in some way
you must feel responsible.

1559
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,881
How could not buying their ore
make me responsible?

1560
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,083
But if you'd buy,
there'd be no more trouble.

1561
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:05,387
I swore I'd never
deal with them.

1562
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:08,023
Suppose I quote
a little, too...

1563
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:11,793
from a man on your side--
Mr. Lincoln:

1564
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:15,330
"Let us strive to bind up
the nation's wounds,

1565
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:17,365
"to do all
which may achieve

1566
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,402
"a just and lasting peace
among ourselves,

1567
01:07:20,404 --> 01:07:24,239
with malice towards none,
with charity for all."

1568
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,556
What are you doing here?

1569
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:42,757
Visiting.

1570
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:44,592
Get out...

1571
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:45,960
both of you!

1572
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:48,329
Who's going to protect
you from the Rebs
if we get out?

1573
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,597
I won't need
any protection.

1574
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,033
From now on, I'm going
to buy from them

1575
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:53,835
just the same
as anybody else!

1576
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:55,170
Don't think so, Balfour,

1577
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:57,505
on account we've
closed the smelter.

1578
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:58,773
On what grounds?

1579
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,341
We'll think of some.

1580
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:03,578
I'm beginning to see
how blind I've been.

1581
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,647
I'll appeal to
the governor, Mr. Travis,

1582
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:09,150
and in the meantime,
I'll offer the Southerners
financial aid!

1583
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,091
(<i> gunshot</i> )

1584
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:40,081
Johnny.

1585
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,316
Johnny!

1586
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,086
What are you doing here?

1587
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:46,454
Open the door.

1588
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,361
You've got to leave.

1589
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:54,796
But I hadn't thought
of leaving.

1590
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:55,897
You've got to!

1591
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,031
You've got to get
out of town!

1592
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,099
Get out of town?

1593
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,300
Let's not go
into that again.

1594
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,568
It's gettin' monotonous.

1595
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:01,369
Listen to me.

1596
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,638
This is your last chance!

1597
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,108
Your interest in me,
ma'am, is positively
touching.

1598
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,643
How stubborn can you be?

1599
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,678
Tonight they are planning
to kill you!

1600
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:14,916
You know, you sound
mighty convincing, ma'am,

1601
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:16,551
but I guess
I'll stay here.

1602
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:19,487
They have too many
people being killed
escapin' from jails.

1603
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:22,190
SCAMPER (<i> whispering</i> ):
Mr. Carter, Mr. Carter!

1604
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:23,858
What's the matter?

1605
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,226
Trouble!

1606
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:26,861
Balfour's dead--
shot in the back
by Travis.

1607
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:29,330
And now they're
buying up our claims
at ten dollars apiece.

1608
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:30,798
Where are they doin' that?

1609
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,934
At the Rainbow--
Travis and some
fellow from Denver.

1610
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:34,002
Meet me around in front.

1611
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:35,203
Yes, sir.

1612
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,574
I guess I'll have
to reconsider that
escape, ma'am.

1613
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,078
LISA:
Johnny!

1614
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,480
There's a horse outside,

1615
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:48,183
with money and provisions
in the saddle bag.

1616
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,484
Head for California.

1617
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:50,985
I'm sorry I can't
oblige, ma'am,

1618
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:53,588
but I've got some business
with some friends of yours.

1619
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:54,155
Scamper!

1620
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:55,390
Yes, sir.

1621
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:57,158
The night the Bassetts
were killed,

1622
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,159
you offered me your gun.

1623
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,594
I'll take it now.

1624
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:01,162
That's what I've been
waitin' to hear!

1625
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:04,032
Oh, no, Johnny,
don't!

1626
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,200
What can I say?

1627
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:07,735
What can I do to make
you believe me?

1628
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:08,736
Look at me!

1629
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,972
Can't you trust me?

1630
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:12,373
Frankly, no.

1631
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:33,394
HENDERSON:
Sign here.

1632
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:38,066
Next.

1633
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,801
Right on this line.

1634
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:43,204
Next.

1635
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:44,305
Just a second!

1636
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:45,974
Sorry to spoil your fun,
my friend.

1637
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:47,041
What do you mean?

1638
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:48,576
Stay where you are,
Sheriff.

1639
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,278
I mean the sale
has been called off.

1640
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,779
Well, you're
a little late, Carter.

1641
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:54,282
Yes, I already have more
than two-thirds of the claims.

1642
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:55,316
Not anymore!

1643
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:56,951
I don't know who you are,

1644
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,886
but I'm quite sure you'll regret
this... this illegality!

1645
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:00,955
There's nothing
illegal about
changing your mind.

1646
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:02,490
Well, that's debatable,
and I doubt

1647
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,025
if these people
have changed their minds.

1648
01:11:04,027 --> 01:11:06,060
They know it will be months,
perhaps years,

1649
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:07,262
before they can sell their ore.

1650
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:08,296
Oh, why?

1651
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,731
The smelter's been closed,

1652
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,766
pending investigation
of Mr. Balfour's death.

1653
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,502
TRAVIS:
Well, look who broke out
of the jailhouse.

1654
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:16,804
Carryin' a gun, too.

1655
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:24,579
Hear you've been using
yours today, Travis.

1656
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,117
Must be a specialty
of yours...

1657
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:30,952
shootin' people
in the back.

1658
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:34,856
So I'm going to give you
a chance at mine.

1659
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:37,725
Joe, give me a beer.

1660
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,793
JOE:
Coming up.

1661
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,109
What are you going to do now,
Carter?

1662
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,744
No more tricks, huh?

1663
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:00,248
That's good, because I'm going
to call your play.

1664
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,482
(<i> crash</i> )

1665
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,684
(<i> gunshot</i> )

1666
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,020
Kick that gun over here.

1667
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:08,356
Come on,
kick it over!

1668
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,328
Now get against the wall.

1669
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:08,850
You see Travis?

1670
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,418
He just passed me
at a gallop.

1671
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,552
He's probably
gone to the smelter.

1672
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,020
Yeah, that's where
his gang is.

1673
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:14,756
Well, looks like a job
for Roberts' Raiders.

1674
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:16,090
There's a
pack of men
out there.

1675
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:17,158
MAN:
Be like attacking a fort.

1676
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,426
ROBERTS:
Mr. Carter?

1677
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:20,628
If my men go,
will you take command?

1678
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:25,199
Gladly, sir.

1679
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,234
How many men will ride?

1680
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:27,769
Somewhere around 40, I think.

1681
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:28,970
That's enough
for two troops.

1682
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:30,037
Newton!
Yes, sir.

1683
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:31,873
You take command of
the first troop, and...

1684
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,674
Sir, I request permission
to lead the second.

1685
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,643
CARTER:
In that uniform,
Lieutenant?

1686
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:38,513
I just gave myself
24 hours' leave, sir.

1687
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:39,647
Permission granted.

1688
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:41,449
Gentlemen, I suggest

1689
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:42,817
we all meet
at Mr. Roberts' house.

1690
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,252
You'll be wantin'
a bugler!

1691
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:45,586
That we will.

1692
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:55,463
Lisa, would you allow me
to apologize?

1693
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:57,799
Of course, Johnny.

1694
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:00,935
I'd like to express
my gratitude.

1695
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:03,070
When I come back,
if I can find the words,

1696
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:05,640
there are a lot of things
I want to say to you.

1697
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:08,576
Will you be here?

1698
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,581
Come back safely.

1699
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:15,716
Don't worry.

1700
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,232
Prepare to mount!

1701
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:32,733
Mount!

1702
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:38,739

Let's go!

1707
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:26,754
More than likely
they'll turn tail

1708
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:27,889
at the first shot.

1709
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:28,756
Yeah?

1710
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:30,057
Well, supposing
they don't?

1711
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:31,926
We've got a surprise
for them.

1712
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,928
Bat, show him
our surprise.

I'm afraid
he's right, sir.

I tell you
what you do:

01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:46,320
dismount half
your men,

1730
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:48,122
maintain a continuous fire
from this area,

1731

and in five minutes' time
with the rest of your men,

1732
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:51,425
charge again,
you understand?

They're bound to have
more powder.

to charge

01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:32,353
Tell Mr. Carter
I'd like a word with him.

1760
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:34,922
Mr. Carter just
rode away, sir.

1761
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:39,660
Giddy up!

1762
01:21:39,662 --> 01:21:41,395
Hup! Hup!

1763
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,064
Whoa! Hold it!

1764
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,002
Where do you think
you're going?

1765
01:21:48,004 --> 01:21:49,603
Sacramento.
Los Angeles.

1766
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:50,838
Well, make up
your minds.

1767
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,239
Well, uh, it really was
San Francisco.

1768
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,909
Look, here's $200.

1769
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:56,043
Get me an engagement ring--

1770
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:58,913
the best
it'll buy.

1771
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:00,514
It'll be a pleasure,
Lieutenant.

1772
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:01,815
Why, congratulations.

1773
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:03,150
Thank you,
Miss Lisa.

1774
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:06,553
And here's a nail I bent
to the exact size.

1775
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:08,355
And now, Mr. Carter,
it'll ease my conscience

1776
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:09,690
if you'll get the blazes
out of here.

1777
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:10,691
(<i> laughs</i> )

1778
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:16,230
My congratulations, too,
Lieutenant.

1779
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:18,365
It's "Captain,"
now, Scamper.

1780
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:19,366
Just got the news.

1781
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:20,401
Well!

1782
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,002
Here we go.

1783
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:23,470
Any special plans?

1784
01:22:23,472 --> 01:22:26,340
Well, I'd still like
to open that theater

1785
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:27,541
if I could raise
the money.

1786
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:29,510
$20,000, wasn't it?

1787
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:30,411
Mm-hmm.

1788
01:22:30,413 --> 01:22:32,079
You know, by a strange
coincidence,

1789
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:34,181
I happen to have
just that amount

1790
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:36,183
in the lining
of my gun case.

1791
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:38,285
A gift from an uncle
in the North.

1792
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,787
Well...

1793
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:41,989
maybe I should marry
the uncle.

1794
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:43,924
Oh, no.

1795
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:46,293
Oh, no!
