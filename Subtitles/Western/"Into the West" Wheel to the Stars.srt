1
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,300
old indian: the white man
called them buffalo.

2
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:47,367
we call them tatanka,
the majestic ones.

3
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:51,434
their story is the story
of our people.

4
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:54,100
tatanka lived in
the underworld

5
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,868
until he saw our people
in a vision.

6
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,067
he saw that
we were needy.

7
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:03,100
and for the love of us,
tatanka came up out of the earth

8
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:06,434
and became flesh
so that we could eat,

9
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,300
make our clothes
and our dwellings
from his hide.

10
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,501
[speaking
lakota language]

11
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:16,033
he called us
the buffalo nation.

12
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,980

13
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,175

14
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,362

15
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:29,651

16
00:02:31,828 --> 00:02:34,828

17
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,868

18
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:47,903

19
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:54,064

20
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:02,339

21
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,801
soaring eagle,
a medicine man,

22
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:09,701
could not accept
the terrible vision
of growling bear,

23
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,868
the buffalo
would disappear,

24
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:15,133
and the lakota would live
in square houses.

25
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,534
man: i suppose the best place
to begin our family's story

26
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,701
is with grandsire abraham.

27
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,167
many was the time as a boy
i listened to his tale

28
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:19,234
of how a cannon subtracted a leg
at the battle of yorktown.

29
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:22,934
i'd have wagered both mine
to see what he saw.

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,834
my misfortune was to be born
in a drab age

31
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,200
and to have lived in
the stifle of a barn

32
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:32,067
where a man was only as good
as the things he crafted.

33
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:35,567
wheelwrights we were,
going back to the time when
they invented the damn thing.

34
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:37,701
wheelers made wheels,

35
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:41,467
but in my day, we'd seen
the wheels made the wheelers.

36
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:45,000
all the long day,
i lived in my books,

37
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:48,167
and by night, i dreamed
of a better life

38
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,000
beyond the mississippi.

39
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,467
morning, enoch.
hi, papa. how are you?

40
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:53,701
good.
good.

41
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,167
nathan.
mornin'.
- nathan.

42
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:12,100
now, that is a thing of beauty.

43
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,334
man: anybody see jacob?

44
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,968
jacob?
jacob?

45
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:29,968
at your age, i was
repairing cannon wheels
at valley forge.

46
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,734
at least you got to see
a bit of the world, sir.

47
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:36,634
that was the war.
we had no choice.

48
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,100
thank god you live in
a time of peace.
yes, sir.

49
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:42,000
apply yourself to the anvil,
and you're set for life.

50
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,701
it takes 10 years to make
a journeyman wheelwright.

51
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:48,334
another 10 for master.
you'll never lack for work.

52
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,634
they need wheels
in time of peace,

53
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,400
they need wheels in time of--

54
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:55,834
don't you sass me,
young man!
yes, sir.

55
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,901
you boys knock off
for lunch now.

56
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:03,534
except jacob.
you already had yours.

57
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,067
[laughter]

58
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,934
plow horse needs shoeing
out there.

59
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:24,968
good morning.
who do i see about replacing
a rifle cock?

60
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,801
that'd be me, sir.

61
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,701
if i may, sir,
how'd you come by that scar?

62
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,834
difference of opinion
with a cheyenne warrior.

63
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,901
savage thought my scalp

64
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,000
might look better
hanging from his belt,

65
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:50,000
but i favored
where god put it.

66
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:54,067
but then i fancied
his locks on my belt.

67
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:55,934
may i?

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,467
sure.

69
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,634
my goodness.
what in the sam hill is that?

70
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:03,701
ho. sacred.

71
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:05,133
grizzly...

72
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,934
on its hind legs,

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,634
about where that
first rafter starts.

74
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:14,701
goodness gracious.
must be hell out there.

75
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,467
it's more like
the garden of eden, son.

76
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,734
come across some tribes'll
give you the girls.

77
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,901
you got mountains
covered with snow in summer

78
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,367
and forests
that go on forever,

79
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,934
rivers that you
can't hardly see across.

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,467
sometimes
you wait half a day

81
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,501
for a buffalo herd
to run past.

82
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,767
big shaggy beasts.
3 times a horse.

83
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,200
horizon to horizon.

84
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:49,067
and the pacific,
unsullied by human hands,

85
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:52,534
as it was on
the eighth day of the world.

86
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:56,501
see if that'll work for ya.

87
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:59,434
thank you.

88
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,834
did you finish shoein' that
plow horse like i told ya?

89
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,434
fine young man
you got here.

90
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,467
if he doesn't get knocked
into a cocked hat first.

91
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,968
and you let the fire
burn down, too.

92
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,267
we could've
turned out another wheel
before the end of the day,

93
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,133
but not now.

94
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,067
think you can
put a sharper edge
on this for me?

95
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,701
yes, sir.

96
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,334
is that...human blood?

97
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,133
arkansas toothpick ain't
for cuttin' your steak.

98
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:31,567
so where are you
headed, sir?

99
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,133
st. louis to meet up
with mr. jedediah smith.

100
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,367
the jedediah smith?

101
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,634
god made only one of him
for all of us to look up to.

102
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:40,067
who's that?

103
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:44,033
mr. smith opened up
the deep west for trappers.

104
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,801
lookin' for a few good
mountain men to explore
the beaver populations

105
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,601
around the great salt lake.

106
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,567
how much can a man make
off a beaver?

107
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:55,400
they keep buyin' beaver hats
in london and paris,

108
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,734
upwards to 4,000
or 5,000 a year.

109
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,601
it's time for you
to get back to work now,

110
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,601
all of ya.

111
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,467
5,000.

112
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:13,334
oh, now, margaret,
that is a fine-looking goose.

113
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,000
do you believe
that beaver story?

114
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,701
jacob: sunday dinner
was another form of labor
with my father and nick...

115
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,133
my mother margaret...
say grace first.

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,901
my brothers ezra,
nathan, and jethro.

117
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:26,734
abraham: for what we are
about to receive...

118
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:29,501
grandfather abraham
presided over the ritual
with grandmother hannah.

119
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:32,367
the wheelers pounded iron
6 days a week,

120
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:35,367
but on the seventh,
we pounded each other.

121
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,868
president adams
is saying to europe,

122
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:40,467
"keep out.
it's all ours."

123
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,767
it needs another jefferson
to take it all.

124
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,801
but isn't the west
just one vast desert?

125
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:46,534
that's a common untruth,
mama.

126
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,367
west is all kinds
of terrain.

127
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,167
it's a veritable
garden of eden.

128
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:53,801
yes. jacob's just returned
from the west wing
of the house.

129
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:55,400
[laughter]

130
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:58,234
jacob,
in fact, has yet to discover
the western side of the barn.

131
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,567
[all laugh]

132
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:02,968
jacob: as with all rituals,
nothing ever much changed.

133
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,834
until that sunday,
when i looked around the table

134
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,234
and said my silent good-bye
to each and every wheeler.

135
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,321

136
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,000
old indian:
heyoka, the clown,

137
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,133
tried to lift their spirits

138
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,501
after growling bear's
dark vision.

139
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:36,167
for the boy, white feather,
there were only questions.

140
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,300
he sought answers
among his family.

141
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,620

142
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,791

143
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,625

144
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:53,527

145
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:56,359

146
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,938

147
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,267
white feather was determined
to discover the meaning

148
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,467
of growling bear's vision

149
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:12,868
and if the future it predicted
could be changed.

150
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:59,225

151
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:03,597

152
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,834
white feather did not
have words to match

153
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,567
what he knew to be true.

154
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:28,734
but he knew that a vision
was a dangerous thing.

155
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,634
he knew a vision
could kill a man.

156
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,801
jacob!
jacob!

157
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:26,267
you hold up!

158
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:29,968
hyah.

159
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,601
jacob!
jacob!
jacob!
jacob!

160
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,067
hyah.

161
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,133
jacob.
jacob.

162
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,667
jacob, wait. hyah!

163
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,534
hyah!
jacob!
jacob!

164
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:49,901
hyah, hyah, hyah!

165
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,367
wait.

166
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:58,000
what do you figure?

167
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,567
just run out
and not tell nobody, hope
your fool scheme works out?

168
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:03,601
i don't expect mr. smith
and mr. fletcher are gonna
tarry long in st. louis.

169
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,400
and ma and pa--
what do we tell them?

170
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,634
tell 'em i love 'em.
i ain't got time to lose.

171
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,534
i made my last
wheeling wheel.

172
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,501
why would a frontiersman
accommodate you?

173
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,567
ask and you shall receive.

174
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,501
mr. eternal optimist.

175
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,367
nathan, i thought you had
more enterprise in ya.

176
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:23,434
jethro, you always
been a blade of grass
bends with the wind.

177
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,767

because he endeavored
to stay upwind of me.

the savages that fell
to his hands.

361
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:29,388
well, you know what?
it's pretty easy

362
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:32,555
to kill a savage
out to scalp you.

363
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:35,788

to a more dangerous opponent

i believe it will, son.

the person being sewed

467
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,688
more than the sewer.

the way was
long and dangerous,

482

492
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:39,694
we came across
a friendly tribe.

493

the people who live
along the river.

495
00:42:44,426 --> 00:42:47,090

00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:49,355
mr. smith purchased horses

497
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:51,821
to replace those
we consumed.

498
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:53,652

this tiny jedediah smith

524
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:56,646
standing on my shoulder,

525
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:58,679

i really want
to be like you,

that i feel inside--

534
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,270
i want to be back
down there with them.

535
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:16,336
what does that make me?

536
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,167

a human being.

537

just like
the rest of us.

538
00:45:20,702 --> 00:45:23,465
are you tempted,
too, sir?

539
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,464
come over here.
sit down, boy.

540
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:26,429
come over here.

541
00:45:30,629 --> 00:45:32,526
jacob...

542
00:45:32,594 --> 00:45:36,091
we're as human
as the least of 'em
down there,

543
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,090
but we're also
more than that.

544
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:41,887
"as a man thinketh,
so he is. "

545
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,554
what do you
think you are?

546
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,118
the lord fashioned us

547
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,782
a little above
the beast,

548
00:45:49,851 --> 00:45:51,848
a little below
the angels,

549
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:54,613
but he gave us
the choice.

550
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,611
and it's great, son.

551
00:46:00,012 --> 00:46:01,576
some of these men,
they come west,

552
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:03,208
they lose
their souls.

553
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:07,808
west is a place
on the map,

554
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:09,138
not a way to live.

555
00:46:09,206 --> 00:46:10,037
don't forget that.

556
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:14,168
a man has to know
his own mind.

557
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,129

00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,032
he says that
we are his prisoners.

575
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:14,628
tell him that maybe
it escaped his notice

576
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:17,994
that he's outnumbered
3 to 1.

[speaking spanish]

578
00:49:30,454 --> 00:49:33,717
he said he would arrest us
if there was 1,000 of us.

580

dismount!

581
00:49:57,271 --> 00:49:58,802
they're gonna take you
to the governor.

582
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:00,136
all right, fletcher,
you look after the men.

583
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:05,998
jacob: the captain took
mr. smith away...

584
00:50:06,068 --> 00:50:09,630
"to make the governor's
acquaintance," he said.

585
00:50:09,698 --> 00:50:11,795
under ordinary circumstances,

586
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:15,626
we might've welcomed
the hospitality of
the san gabriel padres,

587
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:19,356
but there was no mistaking
the fact that we were prisoners.

588
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:12,631
jacob: our time among the mohave
was to cost us both dearly.

589
00:50:33,192 --> 00:50:35,175

590
00:50:37,085 --> 00:50:40,182

00:51:01,235 --> 00:51:03,369

595
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:15,758
the soldados wanted
to set an example.

596
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:18,787
it didn't matter to them
if the men they brought in
as horse thieves

597
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:21,220
were innocent or guilty.

598
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:22,485
indians were indians.

599
00:51:40,678 --> 00:51:44,678
it was a powerful trial to watch
the sun set day after day

600
00:51:45,507 --> 00:51:49,303
over the horizon
i had sacrificed
home and family to reach.

601
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:52,135
whether any of us would live
to see the wide ocean

602
00:51:52,204 --> 00:51:54,400
that had been the object
of our expedition

603
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,434

i got some news for you.

607
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:05,493
where you been?

608
00:52:05,562 --> 00:52:07,193
the governor has given us

609
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:09,626
most generous
but strict instructions.

610
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:13,056
we must depart as we came

611
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:15,289
and never return
on pain of death.

612
00:52:34,546 --> 00:52:38,546
jacob: we were forced
to return east.

613
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,708
i looked back and made myself
a solemn promise

614
00:52:40,776 --> 00:52:43,872
that one day i would see
california again.

616
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:04,033
that a vision
from wakan tanka

617
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,663
would direct
the course of his life.

620
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:23,389
old indian: white buffalo woman
brought us the sacred ceremonies

621
00:53:23,456 --> 00:53:26,285
so that we could ask for help
in our troubles

622
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:29,117
and give thanks for the gifts
from wakan tanka.

623
00:53:29,185 --> 00:53:32,115
she taught us the sun dance.

jacob: once we drank maricopa
with the mohave

628
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,237
and shared their women.

629
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:52,367
but after we had left them,
a party of beaver-eaters

630
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:55,167
had attacked their village
and left it in flames.

631
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:58,297
now we were forced
to run for our lives.

632
00:55:19,187 --> 00:55:20,085

643
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:03,324

for a while.

what does that mean?

648
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:11,252

692
01:00:14,646 --> 01:00:16,976
old indian: the dancer
stares into the sun,

693
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:18,910
sun-up to sundown,

694
01:00:18,978 --> 01:00:20,875
moving with the sun,
dancing,

695
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:22,407
tugging at his tether,

696
01:00:22,475 --> 01:00:24,039
pulling, twisting,

697
01:00:24,108 --> 01:00:27,038
trying to tear the skewer
through his skin.

698
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:31,468
and when he sets himself free,

699
01:00:31,537 --> 01:00:33,468
he is reborn to the world.

700
01:00:33,536 --> 01:00:35,998
he lays on a bed of sage

701
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:38,663
and recites his vision
to the holy man.

702
01:00:40,465 --> 01:00:44,161
jacob: if we never
found this cave,
it would be over.

703
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:45,726
unh!

704
01:00:45,795 --> 01:00:48,526
but in here like this,
we'll die by inches

705
01:00:48,595 --> 01:00:50,459
and nobody will ever
hear from us again

706
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:51,755
or know what happened.

707
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:55,155
the lord revealed the cave

708
01:00:55,223 --> 01:00:58,619
as he sent a fish
to save jonah.

709
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,018
jonah was drowning.

01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:02,916

is the beginning of wisdom."

the fish swallowed up jonah.

714
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:12,611
jonah did not know
it was god

715
01:01:12,679 --> 01:01:14,511
who sent the fish
to save him.

717
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:18,774

to the lord

from the belly
of the beast,

719
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:24,309
"lord, i do not want
to die like this!"

720
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:26,303
now let us pray

to send the boy away,

and only then would
the sickness leave.

760

his dark thoughts,

and any who believed.
