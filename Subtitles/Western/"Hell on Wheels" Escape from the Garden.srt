370
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:23,987
as I did in the South following the war.

371
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,424
You were part of Johnson's
reconstruction effort?

372
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,758
Yes.

373
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:30,427
Part of that success. I was comm...

374
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:33,199
Uh, which success would that be?

375
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:36,038
Restoring rich, white southerners
back into power

376
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:39,408
or the persecution of the newly freed negro?

377
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,312
I was a corrective

378
00:23:43,347 --> 00:23:47,517
to president Johnson's
lack of resolve in Atlanta.

379
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,054
We bent the city to the national will,

380
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:54,859
as I intend to do in Cheyenne...

381
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,296
With or without the help of Thomas Durant.

382
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:59,466
[Gunshot]

383
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,866
Gunshots are a common
occurrence in Cheyenne,

384
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,570
Mr. Campbell.

385
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:08,540
Regarding Mr. Durant,
may I quote you on that?

386
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,044
I wish you would.

387
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:17,556
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

388
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,257
Only you know my heart.

389
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:23,092
From the moment you saw me, you knew me.

390
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:25,393
I bear the mark of Cain.

391
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:28,428
Please forgive me.

392
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,963
I'm a sinner,

393
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,465
a killer of men,

394
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,836
enslaver of the sons of Adam.

395
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,805
I have defied not only God, but you as well.

396
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,775
Please...

397
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,843
I beg you...

398
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,277
Forgive me.

399
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,448
Yes, my son.

400
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,519
I'm listening.

401
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,557
[Crying]

402
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,293
Lead me to your heart,
I pray you, Bishop Dutson.

403
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,980
Father of the ward, gracious one,

404
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:07,037
you know me as you've known
me when heaven was young.

405
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:09,086
Yes. Yes, I know you.

406
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,958
I know your sinful ways.

407
00:26:12,993 --> 00:26:14,526
Come with me

408
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,862
away from that path,

409
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,829
in God's glorious name!

410
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:22,673
By your hand, I beseech you
to remove my sin debt...

411
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:24,702
Slaver, killer,

412
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:26,969
soldier to keep my fellow man in bondage.

413
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,471
Mississippi, Tennessee,

414

Georgia,

415
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:33,373
only you know my depredations.

416
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:35,106
Yes, I will take them from you.

417
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:37,141
Oh, the hurt,

418
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:39,641
the pain, the dead,

the graves,

420
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,946
oh, the prisons... Andersonville,

421
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,045
my greatest sin of all. I'm guilty.

422
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,112
Yes. Yes, you are, my son.

423
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:51,964
You are evil!

424
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:56,686
So long God has wanted me to
punish you for your atrocities.

425
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:59,055
And you have. I'm indebted
to your righteousness.

426
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:00,957
Thank you Lord,

427
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:02,559
heavenly father.

428
00:27:02,593 --> 00:27:04,525
What you had to do to save me,

429
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,392
what you had to become,

430
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:08,026
the sacrifices you had to make

431
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:11,459
to claim and redeem me,
Cullen Bohannon, sinner...

432
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:13,591
Yes,

433
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:16,526
you shall be redeemed, my son.

434
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:18,897
Wounded, betrayed, cast out...

435
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:21,133
You died and yet you were born.

436
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:23,066
No matter what cost,
no matter what sacrifice,

437
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,803
it was justified.

438
00:27:24,837 --> 00:27:28,240
Justification, atonement, redemption!

439
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:30,555
Those that have had to die know this,
even by your hand.

440
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:31,977
God's hands.

441
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,813
Righteous violence, the human sacrifice,

442
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,948
necessary for you to sit at
the right hand of the father,

443
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,717
the right hand of God himself.

444
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:40,451
Dear, sweet, heavenly God, yes!

your ultimate transformation.

[Shouting indistinctly]

451
00:27:57,985 --> 00:28:00,020
You summoned God's righteous strength...

452
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,156
- Truth!
- And did what you had to do!

453
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,993
Did away with the pretender Dutson...

454
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:05,493
- Away! 
- So that you could take

455
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:07,195
your rightful place, praise God!

- Praise God! 
- By your hand,

you traded your life for his! God's hand!

By your hand, you took his life!

459

- Take!
- By your hand,

460
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:17,277
you did away with him who might
have come amongst these people

461
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,678
- as a false prophet. 
- Yes, a false prophet!

462
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:22,748
- So that now, praise God...
- Praise God!

463
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:25,084
Stand amongst us in his place!

464
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:28,521
God himself having cleansed
you of Bishop Dutson's blood,

465
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:31,123
- from these hands! 
- These hands.

466
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:34,058
Cleansed, pristine, immaculate hands!

Praise God!

468

Yes, and I look upon these hands

469
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:39,231
and there is no blood that man can see,

470
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:42,069
- not one drop, praise God! 
- Because...

Marshal Jessup, please step forward.

481
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:21,688
Did you bear witness to the offense

482
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,291
of which Mr. Mcguire had been accused?

483
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,560
I did, judge.

484

Could you please tell the
court what you witnessed?

Shortly after entering the casino,

into that man out there.

488

He was tryin' to take me,
and I called him to account.

495
00:31:08,611 --> 00:31:11,548
I was within my rights.

496
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,386
He had a knife.

497
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,463
You confess to discharging your weapon

498
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:29,600
into the body of the deceased?

499

Well, uh...

500
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:36,037
I shot him,

501
00:31:36,072 --> 00:31:38,473
but he was comin'
at me for namin' him a cheat.

I can't believe that I
let him hold our baby.

Yeah, it gave me a fright too.

511
00:32:29,955 --> 00:32:32,458

- Cullen. 
- Shh. Quiet.

Put the baby down.

I'd be happy to scatter your

Do you make trouble because
you think Mr. Bohannon

532
00:34:21,907 --> 00:34:24,473
will come back and save you?

533
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,776
Or do you make trouble because you miss him

We absolutely may.

Nuh-duh.

Your men have no jurisdiction here.

On the contrary.

554
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:17,905
This is not how we mete
out justice in Cheyenne.

555
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:21,579
It is now.

Not if you ain't.

559
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:41,506
You're thinkin' that
Indian's gonna come back.

560
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:45,311
But we're good here.

561
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,781

You ain't afraid?

Cheyenne?

570
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:39,094
Cheyenne.

Where you been? Is it you?

Yeah, it's me.

609
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:53,446
We thought you was dead.

610

No, I was at the mormon fort.

Oh, I can see that. [Laughs]

612

It appears that the vest Mr.
Psalms is wearin' is mine.

No, was yourn.

620

Elam had your gun and your belongings

621

00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:40,027
Just disappear.

628
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:43,032
Took off to find you.

No Elam.

Well, I got to get goin'.
