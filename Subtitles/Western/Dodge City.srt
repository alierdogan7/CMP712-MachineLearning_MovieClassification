00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,766
-Not from what I've heard.
-You've been listening to too much talk.

165
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,327
Maybe. Maybe not.

166
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,926
Are you calling me a liar?

167
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,082
I'm not calling you anything, Yancey.

168
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,925
-In fact, I'd rather not talk to you at all.
-Keep your hand off that gun.

of the resurrection of the dead.</i>

171

hallowed be thy name</i>

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,285

174
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,524
<i>and forgive us our debts as we also
forgive everyone that is indebted to us.</i>

175

<i>Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i>

176
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,329
To have him go this way,

177
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,481
it's so, so cruel, so useless.

178
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,201
You promised you wouldn't cry, Mom.

179
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,320
-John, will you look after Mrs. Cole?
-You don't have to, Mr. Orth.

180
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,006
-I can take care of her.
-ORTH: That's right, Harry.

181
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,128
You're the man of the family now.

182
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,445
Well, funeral's over. There's your man,
marshal. Serve your warrant.

183
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,888
It's about time those gorillas
were taken in hand.

184
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,365
-What are you waiting for? Go on.
-Don't push me. I know my duty.

185
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,962
-SURRETT: Hello, marshal.
-Yancey,

186
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,566
I've got a warrant here to arrest you
for the murder of

187
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,962
(STAMMERS)
Matt Cole.

188
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,601
Why don't you go ahead and serve it,
then. What are you waiting for?

189
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,445
-Mind riding back into town with me?
-Yeah.

190
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,161
That's all right. You go ahead
and ride in with the marshal.

191
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,691
Why, sure, marshal. Come along.

192
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,566
Come on, boys. Come on, Al.
After all, the law's the law.

193
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,081
Just a minute.
This is your carriage.

194
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,402
-MARSHAL: Hold on!
-YANCEY: Get him in there. Hurry up.

195
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,682
MARSHAL:
I've got the law on my side.

196
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,288
Come on, boys.
We'll ride him out of town in style.

197

(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

198
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,245
Why try to make an honest town
out of Dodge City?

199
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,290
Surrett's crowd scares off
the law-abiding settlers.

200
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,125
They're all going on to Wichita
and Kansas City.

201
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,001
I tell you, Ellen, we're the public
disgrace of America.

202
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,845
You know what the New York
newspapers are saying?

203
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,722
There's no law west of Chicago.
And west of Dodge City, no God.

204
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,723
I'm afraid they're not far wrong.

205
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,163
It's becoming unsafe for a woman
to walk on the streets.

206
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,928
As for children, I almost wish Lee and
Abbie weren't coming to live with us.

207
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,766
They'll be all right, unless they're
as bullheaded as their father.

208
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,765
We haven't heard a word
since they reached Texas.

209
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,922
When do you suppose
they'll get here?

210
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,043
IRVING:
I kept the record somewhere.

211
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,441
-I always used to--
-There, on the table.

212
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,965
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

213
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,727
They left Fort Worth three weeks ago
with a cattle-drive party.

214
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,048
Now, let's see.

215
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,887
Yeah, they must have crossed
the Red River about here

216
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,284
then on up the Chisholm Trail
into the Indian territory.

217
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,331
I'd say they'd be about Broad Plain
by now.

218
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,524
ABBIE:
Tex! Tex.

219
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,082
-Have you seen my brother?
-Yes, ma'am.

220
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,447
He's over yonder
hotfooting it around.

221
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,008
He swiped one of the boss's horses.
I reckon he's drunk again.

222
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,561
I consider that
a very impertinent remark.

223
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,045
Yes, ma'am. I guess maybe I shouldn't
have said he's drunk, even if he is drunk.

224
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,804
(CHEERING)

225
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,090
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about you.

226
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,601
Broad Plain, huh?

227
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,410
Broad Plain.

228
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,006
This is where the Indians
are supposed to be.

229
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,004
If you keep up the fuss,
they'll be on our doorstep.

230
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,322
I wish they would attack us
or something.

231
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,404
It's dull plugging along like this
clay in and clay out.

232
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,683
But that's no reason for you
to act like a lunatic.

233
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,686
Maybe they don't even know
we're here. Let's tell them.

234

(CHEERING)

235
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,851
Lee, stop it. Stop it!

236
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,443
Lee!

237
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,965
Will you--?

238
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,840
WADE: Was that you who fired
those shots, Mr. Irving?

239
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,241
-RUSTY: Sure, it was him.
-What about it?

240
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,244
WADE: Nothing. It seems like
a silly waste of ammunition.

241
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,368
He won't do it again.
He was bored.

242
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,122
-Oh. Faith, now. That's a great shame.
-So am I.

243
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,810
Really? Well, I'm sorry.

244
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,885
Perhaps things will get enlivened
if that shooting stampedes the cattle.

245
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,250
Since you seem to know what troubles
him, I'd suggest you see he drinks less.

246
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,091
Them two is more trouble
than they're worth.

247
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,130
I'll certainly be glad to hand them
over to their uncle in Dodge.

248
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,688
Yeah. She sure is pretty, though.

249
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,402
Yes. I'd still trade the two of them
for one good cigar.

All right, this is it. Tex. Rusty.

251
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,126
Tex, get the steers watered. Rusty,
line up the wagons along the slope.

-Get moving, flat-neck.
-RUSTY: Oh, hush. I'll get moving.

you were telling the doctor what to do.

Think so? I'm sorry, Miss Irving.

266
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,170
It's really no fun playing boss, but
someone's gotta say what's to be done.

267
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,570
Out here, trail boss sometimes even
has to take the law into his own hands.

Yes. Pioneering,
I believe you call it, don't you?

-You don't seem to be enjoying it much.
-Enjoying it?

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,928
Can anyone enjoy being jolted along
week in and week out

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,610
through heat and dust

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,207
with sand in your teeth, in your eyes
and in your hair?

273
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,046
Faith, now. If you didn't like sand,
you shouldn't have left home.

274
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,206
I wouldn't have, but we didn't have
much choice after Father died.

-No, thanks. I can manage.

if you wanted to, but why should you?

-We'll wait for you.

See what you did.
I hope you're satisfied.

-What? I just gave you a little exercise.

You'll do as I please. You people in
the wagons came to us for protection.

You paid for it. Obey orders
until we get to Dodge City.

is over. You're no longer in the army.

Drop it, I tell you.

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,002
You killed him.

329
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,324
Here you are, Tex.
That's for Dr. Irving.

330
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,131
Take the shortcut into Twin Forks,
bear left.

331
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,931
-It's three hours to Dodge. Understand?
-Sure.

332
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,448
I tried to explain it. Tell him
I'll call when we get there.

333
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,649
I hope that doctor's more understanding
than his niece.

334
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,848
-Good luck. Get going, Tex.
-TEX: <i>Adiós</i>.

335
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,163
Miss Irving.

336
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,528
I know how you must feel about all this
and how you feel about my part in it.

337
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,005
But my shot was unavoidable. I'd never
have fired it except to defend myself.

338
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,800
I have no words to tell you
how badly I feel.

339
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,331
Will you leave me alone, please?

340
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,369
Well, well.
So this is Dodge City, huh?

341
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,443
It sort of smells like Fort Worth.

342
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,682
That's not the city, that's you.

343
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,963
Let's get you to a bath
before you're shot for a buffalo.

344
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,402
Gentlemen, can I hold your horse?

345
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,211
Lady, can I carry your basket?

Can I hold your horse?

347
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,364
Can I hold your horses?
I'll watch her real careful.

-What's the idea, sonny?
-HARRY: I'm in business.

349
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,243
I'm the man of the family now.

350
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,489
-WADE: You certainly make an early start.
-What do you charge?

351
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,007
HARRY: A quarter for keeping an eye
on your horses.

352
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,407
Fifty cents for watching them
extra good.

353
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,881
All right, we'll take a dollar's worth
of the extra good.

-Hey, stranger, where's the money?

Oh, so you don't get
any credit here, huh?

-Well, here you are.

You're welcome.

-Just about the same as always.

367
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,002
Gambling, drinking and killing.
And mostly killing.

368
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,165
Had one here just the other night.
Coldest-blooded thing I ever heard of.

369

Yancey shot Matt Cole
at the Gay Lady.

370

Matt Cole?
I used to know him in Texas.

-What was the trouble?
-What was the trouble?

372
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,843
How long since you been in Dodge?

373
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,002
Some time.
We ship up through Wichita.

374
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,845
Well, this town's run by a man
named Jeff Surrett.

375
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,765
Cole was trying to collect
for some cattle he sold.

376
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,446
Fifteen thousand dollars,
Surrett owed him.

377
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,410
Good morning, gentlemen.

378
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,967

with him?

-In about ten minutes, Mr. Surrett.
-All right, hurry it up.

381
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,364
I'm gonna take a bath. Yancey.

in there already.

There's a draft in here.

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,443
What's the idea? I always take
a bath on Saturday mornings.

386
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,286
-Get that fellow out of there.
-Sorry. I can't do that, Mr. Surrett.

387
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,126
-He ain't been in there half an hour.
-He's been there long enough.

388
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,886
Now, you tell him
to get his clothes on.

389
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,208
-All right, all right.
-Wait a minute.

What did you say?

391
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,928
My friend in there paid for that tub.

392
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,971
Much as you undoubtedly need to wash,
he needs it even more.

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,164
Well, if it ain't our old friend Hatton.

394
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,767

Right. Quite a coincidence, isn't it?

395
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,448
Are you figuring on being around long?

396
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,365
No. Just as long as it takes me
to finish my job.

397
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,251
Maybe longer if it's interesting.
Any objections?

398
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,405
-We can make it interesting for you.
-Yes. I'm sure you might.

399
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,962
I hear you made it interesting
for Matt Cole the other night.

400
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,648
You always heard a little too much.

401
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,043
It's possible you boys were always
a little too noisy.

402
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,731
Come on, finish me up.
Put that green stuff on.

Say, Wade. You know, it just
come to me who that feller was.

405
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,851
It did? Marvelous.

406
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,484
Naturally, our nephew's death
was a great blow to us

407
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,167
but since your explanation,
I can understand how it happened.

408
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,368
There's no sense in holding
any grudge against you.

409
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,567
Thank you, sir.

410
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,526
We're used to death
here in Dodge City, Mr. Hatton.

411

Even of the people we love.

412
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,761
-That's hard to say, but it's true.
-Yes, I suppose so.

413
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,930
Well, thanks again, doctor.

414
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,163
Might I pay my respects
to Mrs. and Miss Irving?

415
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,243
No, my boy, I wouldn't advise that.

416
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,404
Mr. Evans wants you to come
as soon as you can.

417

-Oh, excuse me.
-Ellen, this is Mr. Hatton.

418
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,489
How do you do, Mrs. Irving?

419
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,291
He's come to tell us about Lee.

420
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,084
It's regrettable that we have to meet
under these circumstances, Mrs. Irving.

421
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,491
I'm sorry, my boy, but you see,
we never had any children of our own.

422
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,449
And to my wife, Lee was--

423
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,331
Well, you can understand
how she feels about it.

424
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,246
Yes, of course. Anyhow, it was
very gracious of you to receive us.

425
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,409
WADE: Oh, don't bother about that.
Thank you, sir, I--

426
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,244
Miss Irving.

427
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,762
I'll not trouble you with apologies.

428
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,968
But I would like you to know
that if I can be of service

429
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,600
-shall be only too happy.
-Thank you.

430
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,128
The only way you can be of service
is to keep out of my sight.

431
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,525
IRVING: I wouldn't take her
too seriously, my boy.

432
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,480
Women's logic and emotions
are often very confusing.

433
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,291
I think I've heard my father
say the same thing.

434
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,002
I'm sure that Miss Abbie has a more
biting tongue than my mother ever had.

head of prime Texas steer.

the Chisholm Trail. Is that correct?

until I tell you.

439
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,968
Right. The agent reserves his right
to refuse all bids. Who will start us off?

440

of steers that ever come out of Texas.

-Mr. Cagle?
-No, sir.

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,811
Mr. Orth?

-Thank you, 28 is bid.

447

Who'll say 30? Thirty, 30, 30.
Nobody will raise it?

-Thirty dollars.
-AUCTIONEER: Thirty dollars.

450
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,129
Anybody raise that?
Anybody say 32?

451
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,123
How about you, Mr. Orth?

452
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,683
Going to Mr. Surrett for $30.
Once. Going twice.

453
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,765
Hold on.

454
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,561
Mr. Surrett and Mr. Orth
be kind enough to step up here.

455
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,567
AUCTIONEER: Oh, Mr. Surrett, Mr. Orth.
Will you come over here, please?

456
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,600
-You offered $30. Was that cash?
-Do you own those cattle?

457
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,525
I'm the agent.
I'm protecting the owner's interest.

458
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,561
Oh, I see. Well, I'll give you part of it in
cash tonight and the balance in 30 days.

459
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,802
I see. How about you, sir?

460
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,571
I could've paid the full amount
in cash today.

461
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,404
You could've? They're yours.

462
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,291
-Mine? But he offered--
-I said, sold.

463
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,011
What? I made the high bid
on those steers.

464
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,243
I heard, but I prefer to make my deal
with cash buyers

465
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,324
who don't pay off
in the backrooms of saloons.

at 3:00 in Room 15, we'll close this deal.

-Right. Deal is made, Mr. Auctioneer.

-AUCTIONEER: Sold to Mr. Orth.

-I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

-Hello, Mr. Orth.

00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,804
-I'll hold your horse.
-Good.

HARRY: Yes, sir.
I'm a pretty desperate character.

482
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,083
I can see that. Would you take ransom

00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,808
We're going to get a sheriff's order.

649
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,729
Wait a minute. What's this?
Where's the sheriff?

650
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,050
-Somebody ran him out of town.
-Mr. Surrett's the law in Dodge now.

651
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,962
Oh, I see.

652
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,768
-Why don't you make him sheriff, then?
-Yeah.

653
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,161
That's not a bad idea.

654
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,288
Why not?

655
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,529
If I can be of any service
to you gents, let me know.

656
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,526
That's the first jail I've ever seen
you couldn't get in. Come on.

657
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,284
Good day, gentlemen.

658
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,444
-It was all a mistake.
-A mistake, eh?

659
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,206
You promised me
you wouldn't get into trouble.

660
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,011
Shucks, Wade,
I really wasn't in trouble.

661
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,766
You're the sort
who doesn't get into trouble,

662
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,400
until they nail the lid down
on your coffin.

663
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,528
What's that?

664
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,041
"Pure Prairie League of Dodge City."

665
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,610
Wait till I tell Tex about this.

666
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,082
RUSTY:
Don't tell Tex.

667
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,449
WADE: Gentlemen,
what's this all about?

668
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,843
You all look as though
you lost a dollar and found a dime.

669
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,690
CLEMENS:
Go ahead and tell him, doctor.

670
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,242
We've invited you here this afternoon
with a special purpose.

671
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,880
We want you to help us
clean up our city.

672
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,169
Our peace officers
have not been equal to the job.

673
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,882
They've either got killed or run out
of town. Won't you take the job?

674
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,442
Gentlemen, I certainly appreciate
your confidence in me,

675
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,644
but I'm afraid a position like that
isn't in my line.

676
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,723
You're asking me to turn policeman.

677
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,202
I have as much qualifications for that
as teaching the ballet.

678
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,131
You seemed qualified
the other day in the plaza.

679
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,607
I had to get that hardhead
out of there.

680
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,570
Any one of you
would've done the same. No.

681
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,963
We know what we're asking
and the chances you'd be taking,

682
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,243
but it's come to a showdown,
who's gonna run Dodge?

683
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,927
We or Surrett? We're inviting peaceful
immigration here.

684
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,321
Family men with women and children,

685
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,324
and we meet them with
what's called "Hell Street."

686
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,881
I can appreciate
everything you say.

687
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,281
As far as I'm concerned,
it can't be done.

688
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,284
I'm in the cattle business.
That demands all my time.

689
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,046
-I'm sorry.
-I wish you'd think it over, my boy.

690
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,329
-We need you.
-You're asking the wrong man.

691
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,490
-He isn't interested in innocent people.
-Abbie.

692
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,768
Why should he care
what happens to you?

693
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,526
Your struggle to make a living
in a decent city.

694
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,604
Dodge City needs a man
with a sense of public pride,

695
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:20,128
and the courage to back it up
fighting men of equal skill.

696
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,602
But his bravery consists of gunfights
with impulsive boys.

697
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,842
Abbie, stop it!

698
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,604
Well, gentlemen, I don't think much
remains to be said.

699
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,801
Mrs. Irving. Thank you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

700
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,010
ABBIE:
Everybody, get in as quickly as you can.

701
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,130
Come along. Harry, keep out
of that lunch basket.

702
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,450
I can't seem to get my mind off
those pies. How long before we eat?

703
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,409
ABBIE:
Not till we get to Sycamore Springs.

704
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,005
HARRY:
I'll do my best to wait.

705
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,287
ABBIE: Is everybody in?
CHILDREN: Yes!

706
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,169
Here we go. Come along.

707
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,086
WADE: We cross the river here, Rus,
and bear due west into Wichita.

708
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,730
When are you starting?

709
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,882
First thing in the morning.
I'm sick of this town.

710
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,451
(CHILDREN SCREAMING)

711
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,928
WADE:
Good morning.

712
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,369
I know that man.

713
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,206
-Hello, stranger.
-Hello there, Shakespeare.

714
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,569
-Here.
-Thanks.

715
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,887
You better watch that riverbed too.
It's probably gonna be dry.

716
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,609
(GUNSHOTS)

717
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,447
Steady.

718
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,090
I'll help you. Give me those reins.

719
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,525
(SCREAMING)

720
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,850
Let me through. Darling!

721
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,525
Oh, my little...

722
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,682
He was trying to help me.

723
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,208
-Get a doctor, quick.
-I'm afraid a doctor won't be any use.

724
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,882
Children.

725
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,760
This has got to stop.

726
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,082
Oh, my darling. My little baby.

727
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,681
RUSTY:
Come on. Come on.

728
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,083
WADE:
You're all under arrest.

729
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,844
Take them out, boys.

730
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,968
Go on.

731
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,565
Get in there.

732
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,329
I wanted to be sure you'd seen this,
Surrett, so I paid you a special visit.

733
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,769
I've seen it. It looks like you're trying
to run everybody out of Dodge City.

734
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,328
No, no. Not everybody.
Just the undesirable element.

735
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,166
There's no law in Kansas that prevents
a man from carrying a gun

736
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,608
-or coming or going where he pleases.
-There will be one.

737
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,162
Sit down, Hatton.

738
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,322
The merchants won't stand for this.

739
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,285
WADE: I think they will. They helped me
draw this law up.

740
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,326
They're willing to take their chances.
I want to be certain about you.

741
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,802
-Let's get down to cases, Hatton.
-Right.

742
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,843
-What cases?
-We have had a couple of run-ins

743
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,209
but I'll forget them
and see if we can't work together.

744
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,567
If you mean that,
my job will be easier.

745
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,485
-Your job is just what you make it.
-So I hear.

746
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:02,849
-The last sheriffs didn't do well.
-They weren't your type.

747
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,324
They were dumb sheep wearing badges.
In fact, I never bothered to talk to them.

748
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,281
-You'd have told them a thing or two.
-Not what I'm gonna tell you anyway.

749
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,411
Listen. There's no reason
that Dodge City can't be run properly.

750
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,365
As long as you don't try
to change things much.

751
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,485
Because this is a cattle town,
and that's what it's always gonna be.

752
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,486
More than $20 million of beef and hides
comes through here every year.

753
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,406
You know that. You bring them up.
You've been holding the wrong end.

754
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,643
The real money ain't working
for those Texas breeders.

755
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,849
It's here in Dodge City.
This is where they pay off.

756
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,448
-You mean on your roulette tables.
-Sure, coming and going.

757
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,127
If not for the Gay Lady,
that money would go out of Dodge City.

758
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,442
The trade would move
right on to Wichita.

759
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,568
You know that cattle crowd.

760
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,321
After months of work, getting those
cattle up here, they want fun.

761
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,165
They can't get it here,
they'll go where they can.

762
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,120
-And you'd go broke.
-Sure. But I ain't aiming to, Hatton.

763
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,728
You see, I make $100,000 a year,
one way or another.

764
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,962
Frankly, I don't need that much money.

765
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,124
I'd be willing to make a deal
with anybody that would, uh,

766
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,641
well, sort of see things my way.

767
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,167
Make a mighty good deal
for both of us.

768
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,924
A little friendly bribery?

769
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,802
You can catch more flies with molasses
than with vinegar.

770
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,041
True enough. Well, I hope you'll not
be offended, Surrett,

771
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,249
but I don't like the smell
of your molasses.

772
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,410
Better get rid of that gun.

773
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,844
You're north of Front Street here, and
that jail's apt to be a little crowded.

774
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,407
What's the matter? Didn't it work?

775
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,251
-He wouldn't listen to reason, huh?
-No, he wouldn't.

776
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,201
All right, Rus, let's go.
There's a lot to do.

777
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,805
(GUNSHOT)

778
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,165
Don't do nothing like that unless
I tell you to. This ain't the time.

779
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,764
They sure make a fellow
feel at home around here.

780
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,850
They'll even dig you a home
if you're nice to them.

781
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,125
MAN 1: One at a time here, fellows.
Line up there. Here you are.

782
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,205
MAN 2: Will we get this stuff back again?
CUSTODIAN: You sure will.

783
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,122
MAN 3: Disarm me? Not for no man.
MAN 4: Nobody gets my gun.

784
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,488
MAN 1: Never heard of such an idea.
MAN 2: Who does he think he is?

785
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,811
MAN 3: Bet 2.
MAN 4: I call it.

786
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,564
TEX: Raise it 5.
MAN 5: Call 5.

787
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,371
MAN 2: I'm dead.
TEX: King's up.

788
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,965
I guess we better quit.

789
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,724
PLAYER:
Quitting because you're winning?

790
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,400
-You read the sign.
-We don't believe in signs.

791
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,451
That sheriff's a big four-flusher, and that
sign's been bad luck to me all night.

792
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,521
(GUNSHOT)

793
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,361
Guess that'll show you
Hatton ain't bluffing.

794
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,124
That's right, gentlemen,
Hatton's not bluffing.

795
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,203
-You're all under arrest.
MAN 2: For what?

796
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,001
-For not believing in signs.
-All right, deputies, take them away.

797
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,760
-Let go of me.
-Go on now.

798
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,330
I tried to warn them, but I guess
they gotta learn through experience.

799
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,370
-I don't know what you warn about.
-What do you mean?

800
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,682
-You're north of Front Street, aren't you?
-Yeah.

801
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,366
-You're carrying a gun, aren't you?
-Yeah.

802
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,000
-Right. You're under arrest.
-What?

803
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,767
Come on.

804
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,770
But, Wade, I'd feel undressed
without my gun.

805
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,486
Where you're going,
you won't need any clothes.

806
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,405
If I was you, I'd rather arrest
my brother than me.

807
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,881
Hey, Rusty, you are a traitor.

808
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,445
WADE:
Sorry, boys, I can't do anything about it.

809
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,361
Hey, Wade. You ain't gonna keep me
in here, are you?

810
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,690
You read that notice.
Three days in there won't harm you.

811
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,889
You can't do this to me
after all we've been through.

812
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,327
We fought the war,
built the railroad.

813
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,404
We ate, drank, slept, lived
and died together.

814
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,246
Now we're gonna be in jail together.
You in there and me out here.

815
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,450
(MEN LAUGHING)

816

(TRAIN BELL RINGING)

817
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,970
Isn't that wonderful, Joe?

818
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,891
That's seven families
that have moved into town.

819
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,730
That does my heart good.

820
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,400
There's the Turner family,
moving from Wichita.

821
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,325
After she said she'd never set foot
in Dodge again.

822
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,970
Welcome home, Mr. Turner!

823
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,561
-How do you do, Mr. Clemens?
-Hello, Joe.

824
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,321
Isn't that the sweetest bonnet
she's got on? It's brown <i>moiré</i>.

825
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,005
<i>Moiré</i>. Let me see.

826
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,007
<i>Moiré</i>? How would you spell <i>moiré</i>?
M-O-I-R-E?

827
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,323
Who in tarnation gives a hoot
what Mrs. Turner's wearing?

828
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,251
Just about every blessed woman
in town, that's all.

829
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,122
WADE: What happened in this fight
between the Indian and Jim Kendall?

830
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,324
I went into that pretty thorough.
There wasn't no fight.

831
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,609
They called each other names,
the Indian threw a knife

832
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,730
Kendall fired a couple of shots.
Nobody got hurt.

833
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,807
Oh, I see. It wasn't a real fight.
It was just a sort of friendly argument.

834
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,729
-Hello, Tex.
-Hi, fellows.

835
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,082
Come on in and sit down.

836
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,891
WADE: Why's that secondhand store
around your neck?

837
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,008
RUSTY:
Where have you been?

838
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,640
Around. Been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

839
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,131
WADE:
Thinking?

840
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,046
Hope you'll take that job I offered you.
We need another good deputy.

841
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,323
That's what I've been thinking.
I'm going back to Texas.

842
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,124
-What for?
-Oh, I don't know.

843
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,124
This place is getting too big,
calm and peaceful.

844
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,721
Rusty and I have stopped
all the fun, huh?

845
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,925
It's all right for women and children.
I've decided to go back to Texas.

846
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,122
If you made up your mind,
that's that.

847
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,531
-Sure there's nothing we can do?
-No.

848
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,523
-So long, Tex.
-So long, Wade.

849
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,490
Give him his gun, Rusty. Number 27.

850
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,405
If you're ever around,
that job will be waiting.

851
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,007
No, sir. I just don't fit
in a sissy town like this.

852
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,162
Certainly hate to see you go.

853
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,881
I'll miss you fellows, too, a lot.
We had a lot of fun together.

854
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,361
-Yeah.
-So long, knot-head.

855
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,246
But, you see, if I hung around here,
I'd be riding a sidesaddle.

856
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:37,885
Yes, I suppose so.

857
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,522
-All right, Rusty. Arrest that man.
-Who? Me?

858
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,001
-What for?
-He's carrying a gun, isn't he?

859
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,561
Give him back his old room.

860
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,370
-Morning, Joe.
-Hello, Wade. What's the news?

861
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,648
Haven't you read your paper?

862
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,724
-You got those tax notices ready?
-Running them off.

863
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,689
-Come in, come in.
-All right.

864
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,525
-Have a chair.
-You look as though you're pretty--

865
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,044
(NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

866
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,280
-ABBIE: Fred.
-Yes, ma'am.

867
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:29,331
-Would you set this in my copy, please?
-I will, ma'am.

868
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,881
-Oh, Joe.
-Good morning.

869
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,491
Did you want something?

870
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,488
I'd like have my curiosity satisfied.
What are you doing here?

871
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,167
-Well, obviously, I'm working.
-Obviously.

872
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,449
-But at what? And why?
-The town happens to be growing

873
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,685
and the paper needed someone who'd
write things that interest women.

874
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,330
Oh, I see.

875
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,041
Tell me, what are the vital interests
of your women readers?

876
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,724
What other women are wearing,

877
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,566
how to make a Lady Baltimore cake
with two eggs,

878
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,405
and whose baby is going to be born
and when.

879
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,683
-Fascinating.
-Anything else you'd like to know?

880
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,002
What do the doctor
and Mrs. Irving think?

881
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,928
They made the same stupid objections
you're making mentally now.

882
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,289
But when I decide on a thing,
I usually carry it through.

883
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,644
Yes, I noticed that. Of course,
people in general are inclined to think,

884
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:27,050
a newspaper office is an odd place
for a charming lady to be working.

885
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,366
-Are you the delegation sent to tell me'?
-No, no. I just stop trouble around here.

886
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,285
-I don't start it.
-What's wrong with my working here?

887
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,608
It's undignified. It's unladylike.

888
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,650
You ought to be home,
doing needlework.

889
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,485
Sewing buttons on for some man,
I suppose.

890
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,961
They come off.
Someone's gotta sew them on.

891
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,361
A fine career for
an intelligent woman.

892
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,403
-Here are your tax notices.
-WADE: Thanks.

893
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,723
There'll be wailing and
gnashing of teeth when they go out.

894
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,249
Abbie, I know this isn't in your line,
but as long as you insisted on the job,

895
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,449
will you stop calling them
cows in the stockyard?

896
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,046
They're steers. Steers.

897
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,483
I don't see a difference.
"A rise is expected this season

898
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,881
in the price of longhorn cows."

899
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,726
Never mind. I'll correct
this copy myself.

900
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,002
Well, I must be running along.

901
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,766
By the way, may I let you in
to a little secret?

902
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,365
What?

903
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,086
You've got a smudge of ink
on your nose.

904
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,649
-Bye. Goodbye, Joe.
-CLEMENS: Goodbye.

905
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,121
(ABBIE LAUGHING)

906
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,367
I'm sorry. Abbie.

907
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,929
-Is this proper respect for the law?
-I never saw the law fall on its face.

908
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,691
I didn't.

909
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,002
There's a saying in the British army:

910
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,130
"The law must save its face
in front of the natives."

911
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,368
What if the natives object to its face?

912
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,800
We just put them across our knee
and spank them soundly.

913
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,568
-You're not suggesting I'm a native.
-The only native of Kansas is the buffalo.

914
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:59,766
He's got a very hard head, a very
uncertain temper and a lonely future.

915
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,209
Apart from that, there's hardly
any comparison between you.

916
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,085
-Goodbye, Joe.
-Goodbye, Wade.

917
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,409
Good bye.

918
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,648
-I like that fellow.
-ABBIE: Oh!

Cows in the stockyard.

BARBER:
I ain't a man who believes in taxes

922
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,168
but I can see they're a necessary evil.

923
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,483
Somebody's gotta pay for schools,
churches and such things.

924
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,849
Especially now that the town's
getting so darn big.

925
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,085
Yes, sir. They do say there's nothing
certain except taxes and death.

926
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,049
Get up, Hatton.

927
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:44,163
-What for?
-The boys are outside waiting for a talk.

928
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,163
I see.

929
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,566
I'm really surprised at Surrett.
I thought he had more intelligence

930
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,724
than to send you in
on a silly day like this.

931
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,447
-You haven't got a chance--
-Shut up and get out of the chair.

932
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,161
Ten days for this customer.
Five to cool off, five to think it over.

933
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:11,565
You bet, Wade. I'll take care of it.
Come on, sonny boy, I'll buy you candy.

934
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,365
-What were you saying about taxes?
-What taxes?

935
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,124
I don't remember.

936
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:26,524
-Shall I trim your mustache?
-No, no. No, thanks.

937
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,728
I think I can manage.

938
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,606
See that big herd of buffalo grazing
away so peacefully down there?

939
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,809
The trouble with the buffalo is that
they had things too easy at the start.

940
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,442
It works the other way around too.
We had such a bad beginning,

941
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,847
we're bound for a wonderful future.

942
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,047
Typical Irish logic, totally unconnected.

943
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,125
Think so? It may be Irish,
but it's not unconnected. I can prove it.

944
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,569
Thirty years ago, my father met
my mother at the Londonderry Fair.

945
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,731
He'd come down to sell prize pig.
Big, fat, lovely pigs, they were.

946
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,965
And Mother was there after winning
the grand prize for her roses,

947
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:26,131
enormous, big things, as big as
your face and nearly as beautiful.

948
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,251
I don't suppose there were ever roses
like that in the whole of Ireland.

949
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,722
Well, what must happen?
The very last day of the fair,

950
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,891
Father's pigs get out and eat up
every single one of Mother's roses.

951
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,566
Root, stem, flower and all.

952
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,843
Did any two people ever get off
to a worse start than that?

953
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,210
Look at them now. Six big lusty sons,
a score of prize pigs,

954
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,967
and the most beautiful rose garden
in the whole of Antrim.

955
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,686
I envy those who've kissed
the Blarney Stone.

956
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,487
You do? It's cold on the lips.

957
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,290
I think we'd better get back.

958
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,644
-It'll be dark before we get there.
-You sure it's the dark you're afraid of?

959
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,724
-What do you mean?
-You're afraid I might kiss you.

960
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,809
You wouldn't dare.

961
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,443
Now, I wish I were as sure
of that as you are.

962
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,170
May I?

963
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,050
Thank you.

964
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,482
You know, I was just thinking,

965
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,767
the buffalo wouldn't be so badly off
if it didn't have such a one-track mind.

966
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,845
-Then the buffalo wouldn't be a buffalo.
-I suppose not.

967
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,681
You wouldn't be you unless you thought
you might like that kiss.

968
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,729
You seem very sure of my reaction.

969
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,365
Oh.

970
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,445
That's something you can never be
sure about till you've tried it.

971
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,964
Can you?

972
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,001
-Good morning, Abbie.
-Good morning, Mrs. Cole. How are you?

973
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,328
So-so. Just so-so.

974
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,882
Well, won't you come in and sit down?

975
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,044
There. Is there anything
I can do for you?

976
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,010
I'd like to run this advertisement
in your paper.

977
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:43,122
-That is, if it doesn't cost too much.
-Our rates are very low, I'm sure we can.

978
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,884
You want to sell your house?

979
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,806
No, I don't want to. I have to.

980
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,050
Abbie, let's get a new lead line
on this church bazaar story.

981
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,851
-How do, Mrs. Cole?
-Good morning, Joe.

982
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,241
ABBIE: Joe, how much will you
charge on this?

983
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,920
One, two, three, four...

984
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,445
Selling your house?

985
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,331
-You're not leaving town, are you?
-No, I just...

986
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:09,122
Well, I can't afford to keep it. I can't
even begin to meet the taxes on it.

987
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,563
I can't understand that.
Matt always made good money.

988
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,121
Why, just the day he died--

989
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,523
He collected $15,000 from Surrett,
didn't he?

990
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,088
That's what I thought too.
But I've never seen a penny of it.

991
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,128
Well, what have you done about it?

992
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:30,121
I've spoken to Jeff Surrett about it,
but he'll never give me an answer.

993
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,765
-Joe.
-CLEMENS: Yes?

994
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,561
It looks as if Mrs. Cole needs help.
We might be able to give it.

995
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,762
Yeah, it does look that way.

996
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,890
Mrs. Cole, would you mind
if we looked into this?

997
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,880
Mind, Joe? Oh, I'd consider it
a very great favor.

998
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,084
There are a lot of accounts
in this town to be settled.

999
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,123
Now, let's see.

1000
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,442
How's the best way to tackle this?

1001
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,401
There, the entry, the date
and figures, $15,000.

1002
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,643
What Matt Cole did with
his money after is his business.

1003
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,043
He had $10 when he was found.
He never left the saloon.

1004
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,851
Hatton, I do not discuss
my customers,

1005
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,731
but since you force me,
I'll give you facts.

1006
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,611
Matt Cole lost that $15,000
playing roulette.

1007
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,491
Playing roulette?
I'd like you to remember that.

1008
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,370
Don't worry, I'll remember.

1009
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,400
We'll all remember.
He never went near those tables.

1010
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,046
He went to the bar,
and Yancey killed him.

1011
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,646
-According to who?
-You'll find out in court.

1012
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,724
If you've got such a clear case,
arrest me now.

1013
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,601
No, I think we'll wait a few days.
I'll talk to a few more people

1014
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,048
before we give you board and room
at the state's expense.

1015
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,568
You're bluffing, Hatton.
You're holding a pair of deuces.

1016
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,560
Am I? Munger killed Orth because
he spoiled a cattle deal for you.

1017
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:47,202
Yancey killed Cole because he tried
to collect $15,000.

1018
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,007
A dozen other citizens have
been killed doing business with you.

1019
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,851
That's what the three of us
will prove in court.

1020
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,731
We'll see if the jury thinks
we're bluffing.

1021
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,609
Take that book with you.

1022
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,481
I can hardly wait to write this story.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1023
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,850
this will be the most important article
ever in the <i>Dodge City Star</i>.

1024
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,560
(CLEMENS CHUCKLING)

1025
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,210
There it is.

1026
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,647
We'll have it out by noon tomorrow.

1027
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,485
How did you find out
all this about Surrett?

1028
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,120
Abbie, a good newspaperman
has two jobs.

1029
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,681
One is to write the news
as it happens.

1030
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,645
The other is to be ready
and write it first.

1031
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,963
All but the end.

1032
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,851
This is Jeff Surrett's morgue.

1033
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,843
I must be an optimist at heart.

1034
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,328
I've been getting it ready
for a long time.

1035
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,967
Hey, you two, haven't you homes
to go to? It's past midnight.

1036
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,408
You'd better be running along.
The doc will skin me alive.

1037
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,528
We've got Surrett by his neck.

1038
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,321
Well, let it go for the night
and resume your grip in the morning.

1039
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:55,007
You two realize what kind of a target
you'd make from out there?

1040
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,608
Come on, before your uncle
gets after Joe with a shotgun.

1041
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:04,247
-I'll come stay till you're finished, Joe.
-CLEMENS: Don't worry.

1042
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,007
I'm just gonna mark it for the printer,
then call it a day.

1043
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,050
Don't hang around,
or Surrett might mark it for you.

1044
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,720
They wouldn't try anything
at this stage.

1045
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,769
Think not? I hope you're right.

1046
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,242
-Good night. See you in the morning.
-Good night.

1047
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:23,928
-Lock this door up when we go.
-I'm accustomed to being up after dark.

1048
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,606
-Lock it.
-All right. All right.

1049
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,081
-ABBIE: Good night.
-CLEMENS: Good night.

1050
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,970
"The laws of Dodge City must be
respected, not only by one group,

1051
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,766
but by all groups." Paragraph.

1052
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,691
I like that.

1053
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,804
(GUNSHOT)

1054
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,844
What was that?

1055
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,323
Whoever killed Joe Clemens ought to be
strung up. And I'll furnish the rope.

1056
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,642
If he's got enough neck to put it on.

1057
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:21,084
MAN: They sneaked up on him,
never even give him a chance.

1058
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,206
IRVING:
The bullet went through his heart.

1059
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,361
I can only blame myself for this.

1060
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,364
But it's one thing they won't
get away with.

1061
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,251
Little fellow sure was aces.

1062
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,368
It's too bad.

1063
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,128
I can't understand it.

1064
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,681
Joe didn't have an enemy
in the world

1065
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:46,128
except Surrett and his gang.
Who else could've done it?

1066
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,251
Isn't it proof that Joe's story is gone
and the whole file on Surrett?

1067
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,610
This door was locked.
I know because I tried.

1068
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,321
It's an old lock. Any key will fit it.

1069
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,090
-Nothing in here?
-No.

1070
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,841
He always left his copy on top
so we could set it in the morning.

1071
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:12,489
I'm sorry, sheriff. That's printer's ink.
You can't wash it. It has to wear off.

1072
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,044
Did you ever read the contents
of Joe's files?

1073
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,084
I certainly did. There was enough
to hang him.

1074
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,770
(SILENTLY MOUTHS)
Keep that to yourself.

1075
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,922
I think you ought to go to bed now.
You're looking tired.

1076
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,161
Good night.

1077
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,288
See the doctor
and Miss Irving home.

1078
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,891
MACK:
Right.

1079
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,286
RUSTY:
What's the next move, Wade?

1080
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,807
WADE:
You sure he isn't in his office upstairs?

1081
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,804
Surrett left town
on the 4:30 train this afternoon.

1082
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,765
If you don't believe us,
ask the station agent.

1083
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,486
He was halfway to Wichita
when it occurred.

1084
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,120
You're barking up the wrong tree.

1085
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,171
Thanks.

1086
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,804
Your bet.

1087
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,010
Your bet.

1088
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,970
-TAYLOR: Three dollars.
-I call.

1089
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,482
Who's winning all the money?

1090
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,329
Been playing long?

1091
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,043
Ask the bartender.
He's got a watch.

1092
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,520
What do you know about
Joe Clemens, Yancey?

1093
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,601
No more than you,
except he's dead.

1094
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,689
How did you know he was dead?

1095
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,166
I heard the boys talking. People
keep dropping in and out of here.

1096
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,402
TAYLOR:
Bet you 5.

1097
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,764
-HENCHMAN: I call.
-Yeah?

1098
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,011
Three fives.

1099
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,691
-You're under arrest, Yancey.
-YANCEY: For what?

1100
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,848
For the murder of Joe Clemens.

1101
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,169
-I'll be back in half an hour.
-I wouldn't count on that if I were you.

1102
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,283
Take him along, Rusty.

1103
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,290
What's the matter, Taylor?

1104
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,930
Are you nervous?

1105
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,089
Go ahead. Deal them.

1106
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,725
Yancey seemed vague about this game.
Suppose you tell me what happened.

1107
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,008
How should I know?
Ask one of them.

1108
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:02,161
I'm asking you. Did Yancey ever leave
this table after the game started?

1109
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,721
No. He never left the room.

1110
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,521
I told you 100 times,
he never went out.

1111
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:10,041
WADE: You're wasting time.
Answer my question.

1112
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,521
No, he never left the table.

1113
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,370
Stop lying. You're bad at it.

1114
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,689
Yancey left that room sometime
between midnight and 1:00.

1115
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,171
-No.
-What time?

1116
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,364
-He didn't leave.
-Let me work him. I'll make him talk.

1117
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,807
-TEX: You can't, I can.
-Let him alone.

1118
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,646
If you're too stupid to realize
you're facing a charge of murder.

1119
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,121
You deserve what's coming to you.

1120
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,811
-What do you mean?
-I'll indict you for murder

1121
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,731
-as an accessory.
-I had nothing to do with it.

1122
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:41,207
WADE: You'll be dancing in thin air
like Yancey.

1123
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,284
You wanna swing, or do you
want to save your neck?!

1124
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,851
All right.

1125
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,445
I'll tell you.

1126
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,011
Come on.

1127
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:52,883
He went out about 12:30.
Came back about half an hour.

1128
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,250
That's better.

1129
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,766
I'll do you a favor, Taylor.
Lock him up.

1130
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,563
(KNOCKING)

1131
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,644
-WADE: Good morning.
-MRS. IRVING: Morning.

1132
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,327
-Did you get more out of Bud Taylor?
-I did. Where's the doctor?

1133
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,130
-MRS. IRVING: In there.
-What did he say?

1134
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:27,248
-Morning, Mr. Hatton. You'll join us?
-It's imperative you get Abbie out today.

1135
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,845
Why?

1136
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,564
Only two people beside myself heard
Surrett lie about Cole losing his money.

1137
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:37,764
One was Joe Clemens.
That's why Surrett had him killed.

1138
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,810
You're the other who can go to court.

1139
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,566
Without you, he'll deny the thing.

1140
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,520
That's why I should stay.
I started this, and I'll see it through.

1141
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,083
Will you not be an idiot?
Your life isn't worth a nickel

1142
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,762
as long as Surrett's out of jail.
You're the key to our case.

1143
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:58,686
We can't go to trial for two weeks.
You'll be in danger every minute.

1144
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,081
In this house, in the street.
Everywhere.

1145
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,004
I know what he'd do.

1146
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,806
You know I'm right, doctor.
Get her out of town.

1147
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,486
-Stay out until I send for you.
-MRS. IRVING: You're right.

1148
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,484
I see what you mean.
Abbie must take the next train.

1149
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:15,890
And she can stay with the Merrills.
I'll pack a valise at once. Help me.

1150
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,766
I'd never forgive myself
if anything happened.

1151
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,009
I won't go. You can't boss me around.

1152
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,528
Can I not? I'm the law
in this town, and you'll do as I say.

1153
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,803
I don't care what you are.
I'll stay right here.

1154
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,602
You're the most stubborn thing I've met.
I'm doing this because I love you.

1155
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,162
-Well, why--?
-MRS. IRVING: <i>You two. Stop arguing.</i>

1156
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,766
Don't worry, Mrs. Irving.
We've stopped.

1157
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,970
What he needs is a rope.
He don't deserve a trial.

1158
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,408
MAN: Hand him over to us.
We'll give him a trial.

1159
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,368
Well, this is more like it.

1160
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,291
The last time I saw a mob like that
was in Texas

1161
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,369
for Curley Hawks' necktie party.

1162
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,810
-TAYLOR: Mr. Brand, I wanna talk to you.
-You got 10 minutes.

1163
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,321
-LAWYER: Hello, Yancey.
-Hello.

1164
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:17,002
-What's going on? Why's the mob here?
-Now, take it easy. Take it easy.

1165
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,805
Well?

1166
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,724
You might as well know this now.

1167
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,804
They wormed it out of Taylor
that you left the room.

1168
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,764
They can't hang me on that.

1169
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,369
Maybe a jury wouldn't hang you,
if you ever get to a jury.

1170
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,004
-What do you mean?
-Well--

1171
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,128
-What are you trying to say?
-Well...

1172
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,124
Joe Clemens was a mighty
well-liked man, Yancey.

1173
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,930
He had a lot of friends.

1174
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,323
LAWYER: Half of Dodge City is planning
to break in here

1175
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,649
-and take things in their own hands.
-Where's Jeff?

1176
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,441
-He's gotta get me out of here.
-I telegraphed him an hour ago.

1177
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,685
-He got off the train at Spearville.
-He got off? For what?

1178
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,521
He's smart enough to know this town
will be warm for a few days,

1179
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,810
so he's just kind of laying low
until the excitement blows over.

1180
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,561
Too warm for him, huh?
So I get hung for doing his job?

1181
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,769
-Yeah? Well, if you think that I'm--
-Shut up, you fool.

1182
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,691
-Wanna tell the whole town?
-You bet I'll tell.

1183
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,487
I'll tell who paid me to shoot
Joe Clemens and Matt Cole.

1184
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:20,241
If I go, Jeff's going with me.
Now you telegraph him that.

1185
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,768
Get me out before night,
or I'll give the story to Hatton.

1186
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,289
-All right, but how can Jeff get you out?
-I don't know.

1187
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,804
-That's his problem.
-All right, keep your shirt on, Yancey.

1188
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,043
I got an idea how Jeff and I
can handle this. Yeah.

1189
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,611
First, I'll see Hatton.

1190
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,447
-What are you waiting for Hatton?
-MAN 1: Yeah, what are we waiting for?

1191
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,683
-If you don't know what to do, we do.
-You bet we do.

1192
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,923
-You gonna give us some action?
-MAN 2: We'll give him action.

1193
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:53,325
MAN 3: You don't turn him over to us,
we'll come get him our own way tonight.

1194
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,927
WADE: Listen, men. You put me
in this office to enforce the law.

1195
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,525
I'm going to enforce it.

1196
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,644
That means a fair trial
for any and all prisoners,

1197
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,211
including Yancey.

1198
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:06,208
And understand this:

1199
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:11,002
There's gonna be no mob rule
around this town as long as I'm sheriff.

-You see? They're right at the door.

1202
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,883
What are you gonna do about it?

1203
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:26,368
Yeah, Wade. The whole town's set
on getting Yancey out.

1204
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,929
You can't stop them, the five of you,
while they burn down the building.

1205
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,521
Save trouble if we feed him
to the mob.

1206
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,206
Throw my client
to that pack of hungry wolves?

1207
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,530
Listen, no one's gonna get your client
but a jury. I promise you that.

1208
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,285
Only one way to protect him.

1209
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,205
He's gotta be taken out
of Dodge City before night.

1210
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,330
Fat chance we'd have
of getting him to the station.

1211
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,241
Get a closed carriage, drive to
Spearville, catch a train to Wichita.

1212
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,370
Keep him in jail there
till he can be tried legally.

1213
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,522
-Yes, that might work.
-It will work.

1214
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:01,651
My client's entitled to a fair trial.
It's our job to see he gets it.

1215
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,446
-You want me to rustle a carriage?
-Yeah.

1216
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,284
Oh, wait.

1217
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:09,603
-I got a better idea.
-But you agree. We gotta get him out.

1218
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,081
Yes, but we'll do it my way.

-WADE: Get in, Rus. Get in.

Hold them off as long as you can, Tex.
I'll send word from Wichita.

-Say, what--?
-Keep calm. This is official business.

I've got a prisoner here for Wichita.

01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,042
Oh, you can get married any time.

1285
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,885
We'll even go on your honeymoon
to Virginia City.

1286
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:41,044
-Oh, thanks.
-Getting married has ruined a lot of men.

1287
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,689
DODGE:
<i>Doesn't it mean anything to know that</i>

1288
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,491
<i>there's terror and death you can stop?</i>

1289
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:52,087
WADE: <i>Yes, it does, but the decision
isn't as simple as that.</i>

1290
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:55,562
<i>If I were free, it might be different,
but I'll have a wife.</i>

1291
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,688
<i>Abbie doesn't wanna go pioneering.</i>

1292
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,641
We're planning on coming back here
from New York and settling down.

1293
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:06,010
There's a wagon train leaving here
the middle of next week for Nevada.

1294
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,246
A great trip, wouldn't it?

1295
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:22,647
Darling, I was just telling the boys
how we're settling down...

1296
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,007
-Lemonade?
-Thank you.

1297
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,525
-Lemonade.
-Thank you, ma'am.

1298
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,847
Darling, I was telling Colonel Dodge
about our honeymoon.

1299
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,608
How we'll see all the shops,
the theaters and Niagara Falls.

1300
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:55,241
Colonel Dodge, when do we start
for Virginia City?

1301
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,722
Wade, it looks like you're marrying
the right girl.

1302

1303
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,930
Virginia City!
