1
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,683
I don't remember much about my father,
Jebediah Seagrave.

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,205
I don't care to neither.

3
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,081
I remember his horse, Abraham,

4
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,569
with those coal black eyes.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,207
I do remember my mother's face,

6
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,689
watching him as he rode off.

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,607
Hard to say as to say
what actually happened up there

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,171
in those mining camps.

9
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,251
The story goes;
He and his men came up empty

10
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,931
turned on each other.

11
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,927
People said it was my father
who clone the killing.

12
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,122
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

13
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,241
Come on.

14
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,721
One thing, Wyatt.

15
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,330
I intend to bring Father back.

16
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,330
I'm going to stand the son
of a bitch in front of Mother,

17
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,520
have him look her in the eye
and explain why he left.

18
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,764
I can't do that if he's dead.

19
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,646
He ain't the type of man
to be stood up in front of nobody.

20
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,400
I want Mother to hear it.

21
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,961
If Jesus himself
came down off the cross

22
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,605
and told her the truth,
she wouldn't hear it.

23
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
<i>Jesus'?</i>

24
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,967
What do you know about Jesus?

25
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,047
Oh, I know plenty.

26
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,601
I got to try.

27
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,565
He's a murderer, Samuel!

28
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,721
Yeah, well who ain't?

29
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,131
You wouldn't know nothing about it.

30
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,208
Promise me
we're going to bring him back alive.

31
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,000
You got my word.

32
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,246
What can we do you for, Sheriff?

33
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,601
A man in Mr. Hall's employ
was killed last night.

34
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,926
Up in the high country north of here.

35
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,042
Got his throat cut
and his gold stolen from him.

36
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,043
Did you figure out
who it was that did this?

37
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,930
She saw the whole thing.

38
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,726
Now she described the assassin.

39
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,367
I was reminded of you, Wyatt.

40
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,211
I wasn't anywhere near there.

41
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,567
I'll take a gander in your saddlebags

42
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,001
if you've no objection.

43
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,764
Well...

44
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,164
I wonder if you might have
hid the treasure in your house,

45
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,725
- or your-
- I'll tell you what,

46
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,684
you set one foot on my property
and I'll shoot you myself.

47
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,808
You rest assured, sir,

48
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,324
I'll be keeping close tabs on you...

49
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,485
and yours.

50
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,805
Jesus, Wyatt. Nothing's been drawn.

51
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,850
He can kiss my ass.

52
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,123
That old coot's got a gun and a badge,
and a bug up his ass over you.

53
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,447
Oh, he just likes to
give himself talk, is all.

54
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,842
Where did you disappear
to last night, anyway?

55
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,481
Felt the need to dip my wick
and have a coke,

56
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,443
not that it's any
of your fucking business.

57
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,210
Right on time.

58
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,243
Allow me to introduce
Colonel Rupert Thomas,

59
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,006
a veteran of the Indian wars,

60
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,488
instrumental in the campaigns
against Red Cloud and the Sioux.

61
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,886
The Colonel will be accompanying
you both as guide,

62
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,128
and as a representative of the bank.

63
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,561
That wasn't part of our agreement.

64
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,847
As the Colonel is familiar
with the territory,

65
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,884
I think you'll find
him a very valuable asset.

66
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,361
Asset or not, we had a deal.

67
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,971
I'm afraid the matter
is not open to discussion.

68
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,881
I'm counting on your expertise, Colonel.

69
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,490
I foresee none
but the usual travails, Mr. Howell.

70
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,321
What do you think?

71
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,442
I'll tell you what.

72
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,366
If ol' Rupert over there
even looks at me crossways,

73
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,601
I'm gonna gut him like a pig

74
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,404
and ditch his carcass
in the nearest crick.

75
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,441
Hey, Rupert!

76
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,366
You coming?

77
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,081
One thing.

78
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,445
A man to Halston came back.

79
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,007
You know his name?

80
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,567
Hawkins. Percival Hawkins.

81
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,528
Well, I'm going to need to talk to him.

82
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,880
You know where we can find him?

83
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,807
Indeed I do.

84
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,721
Whoa.

85
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,361
This is it.

86
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,000
Anybody in there?

87
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,082
Hey!

88
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,408
What?

89
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,049
Hey can we, ah,
speak to you for a second, please?

90
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,005
Hey, slow down there.

91
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,041
Hey, we ain't trying to hurt you,

92
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,809
just trying to ask
a couple of questions.

93
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,928
Hey, can you... can you hear me?

94
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,366
Show him the picture.

95
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,807
You know this man?

96
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,048
I make that to be
an affirmative response.

97
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,330
Come here. Let me see.

98
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,084
Here, let me see it.

99
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,362
- Jesus.
- It was hands, Jesus.

100
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,442
- Hands.
- It's his tongue, right?

101
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,686
It's ripped out.

102
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,366
It's no ordinary type of evil would turn

103
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,562
a mountain of a man
like him into mush.

104
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,281
Did you ever doubt
it was done to shut him up?

105
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,442
Hey, look.

106
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,530
Well, if that was the goal,

107
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,362
either by Jebediah's hand or another,

108
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,649
I call this a grand success.

109
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,081
It's a shame.

110
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,770
He's a good-looking bastard.

111
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,728
You knew he was mute.

112
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,444
Why the hell
didn't you say something?

113
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,962
Man lost his boy a few weeks back.

114
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,490
I was leading another expedition.

115
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,771
We ran out of supplies.

116
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,925
Forced to turn back,
we ran across him in the timber.

117
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,007
Panicked.

118
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,569
Tried to warn the poor bastard.

119
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,846
Come on!

120
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,765
The eggs are frozen.

121
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,520
Morning, Lisa.

122
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,051
Looks like the boys
left you a little shy on wood.

123
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,365
I can chop some if need be.
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

124
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,250
I wanted to ask you
a couple 'a questions...

125
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,361
About...?

126
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,370
Your brother-in-law.

127
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,201
My dear.

128
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,042
What's he done?

129
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,809
You expecting company?

130
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,243
What can I do for you boys?

131
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,524
We're here to survey the property.

132
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,451
For what purpose,
and on whose authority?

133
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,921
Mr. George Howell
of the Dawson City Bank.

134
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,210
They're foreclosing on the 28th...?

135
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,200
Get the gun.

136
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,246
God damn it! Get the horses!
Samuel, get the horses!

137
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,407
Go!

138
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,284
God damn it!

139
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,366
God damn it!

140
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,843
Come here, girl, come here.

141
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,928
Come here. Come here. You alright?

142
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,128
Come here.

143
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,441
The horses?

144
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,526
One got away.

145
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,641
The other one's got
a broken fetlock, I think.

146
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,927
Where are you going?

147
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,404
Jesus Christ, Wyatt.

148
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,251
You're a real genius.

149
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,681
Fuck!

150
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,566
How are we to continue?

151
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,481
Wagon gone,

152
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,485
two horses lost!

153
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,210
You know what?

154
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,526
We got one horse left.

155
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,244
Quit your whining, we'll make do.

156
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,284
The bulk of these supplies was to be
delivered to Hall's man York!

157
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,447
What am I supposed to tell him?

158
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,289
You could tell York to come
and fetch it himself!

159
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,768
Each and every item on this wagon was
duly entered into my log!

160
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,927
I am I am accountable!

161
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,451
You wanna pull that piece?

162
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,965
You gonna stand there like a cunt?

163
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,529
My employer has entrusted me with a task
that I intend to fulfill.

164
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,650
Believe me when I say, sir,

165
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,524
I wish it were otherwise.

166
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,764
We'll continue to the start line
as planned.

167
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,290
He's a good man, York.
Runs a tight ship.

168
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,286
It's the Colonel!

169
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,522
York?

170
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,607
It's Colonel Thomas.

171
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,248
I'm afraid we've lost our wagon

172
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,488
and your shipment
a few miles south from here.

173
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,171
Colonel, is it really you?

174
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,890
Easy. Easy.

175
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,691
These are the carriers.

176
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,566
Carriers?

177
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,760
Have you struck a new vein?

178
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,121
Hey, we ain't going back,
you know that, right?

179
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,487
Wait here.

180
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,602
Ugh!

181
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,725
Is this some kind of a joke?

182
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,047
Joke?

183
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,766
Are you all mad?

184
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,329
- Has this entire company gone mad?
- Yes!

185
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,320
Now you see what I'm up against!

186
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,204
- Degenerative lust. All of them.
- Come on.

187
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,882
Scheming. Plotting against me!
Let's kill them all!

188
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,801
No gold.

189
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,081
Samuel.

190
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,166
What am I looking at?

191
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,001
She'll be all right.

192
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,806
She's a strong woman.

193
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,768
I just wonder how she's doing
with the baby is all.

194
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,045
Still haven't given him a name yet.

195
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,722
Four months old and no name, huh?

196
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,440
Come on...

197
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,122
You know what.

198
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,486
Maybe

199
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,642
you should ask someone who gives a shit.

200
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,841
Which ain't yours truly.

201
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,689
You son of a bitch.

202
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,927
Help me UP.

203
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,204
Come on, brother. You' re OK.

204
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,484
What's the Timber like, Colonel?

205
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,480
Eventful.

206
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,443
You ever met
the fella we're going after?

207
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,683
I'm afraid I have not had that pleasure.

208
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,727
Pleasure?

209
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,362
I can't say as
I ever experienced much in the way

210
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,962
of pleasure in the company of Jebediah.

211
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,841
What about you, Samuel?

212
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,531
Howell tell you that
me and Samuel are kin to Jebediah?

213
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,882
He tell you we ain't seen
him since we was boys?

214
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,048
I believe I'll retire for the night,
gentlemen.

215
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,286
Yeah, you do that.

216
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,171
You been meaning to pick a fight
since you laid eyes on him.

217
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,691
I don't trust the son of a bitch.

218
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,244
You saw what he did to his man York.

219
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,728
You really think he means us harm?

220
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,401
Means it or not, if it comes to that,
I will cut his fucking throat.

221
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,171
I don't know as there's any
call to take it so personal, Wyatt.

222
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,482
If he intends to hurry the reaper,

223
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,570
then by God I call that personal.

224
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,881
Colonel,

225
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,010
one more thing.

226
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,563
Once Mr. Seagrave is dead

227
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,725
kill them both.

228
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,964
You sense it, too.

229
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,406
What's that?

230
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,490
Our demise.

231
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,241
When we was kids,

232
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,768
mother used to chorus Bible verses.

233
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,841
I do remember her saying something

234
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,491
about the road to hell
being paved with good intentions.

235
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,608
I can't say my intentions
have always been good.

236
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,124
In fact, I'd venture to say...

237
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,885
I believe I'm going to hell.

238
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,171
I aimed to kill Jebediah...

239
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,567
Wyatt!

240
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,002
Wyatt!

241
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,202
Wyatt!

242
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,962
Wyatt!

243
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,850
Cut me down! God damn it,

244
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,042
You all right?

245
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,287
I cut my hand.

246
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,726
This is a nightmare.

247
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,727
Where's the horse?

248
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,407
She run off.

249
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,802
Which way?

250
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,207
Where you going?

251
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,769
We'll never make
it back home without a horse.

252
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,770
We ain't going back home.

253
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,966
We're licked, Wyatt.

254
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,127
- Going back...
- We've got no food,

255
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,287
ain't an option.

256
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,327
I pissed my pants, Wyatt...

257
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,847
I was hanging upside down
not five minutes ago with piss

258
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,123
running up my neck!
I'm done. It's over.

259
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,368
What the hell am I doing out here?

260
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,527
Listen.

261
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,645
I've got a wife and baby at home.

262
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,682
Listen to me.

263
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,168
Look at me.

264
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,527
You were the one

265
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,564
that wanted to bring Jebediah back.

266
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,524
You were the one who said
he had to be held accountable.

267
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,290
Well he's not worth dying over.

268
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,400
Now I'm going home, Wyatt.

269
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,690
I'm going home to my wife
and my son where I belong.

270
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,605
You want to come with...

271
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,368
Be my guest.

272
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,891
I ain't going home, Samuel.

273
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,326
Then fare thee well.

274
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,204
I'm afraid it's not enough.

275
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,480
We had a deal.

276
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,162
Taking into account interest accrued,
back taxes, penalties...

277
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,571
In English.

278
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,005
You're still in arrears.

279
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,361
I'm afraid the bank
has no choice but to foreclose

280
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,250
according to the terms
of your contract...

281
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,168
That ain't right!

282
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,011
The contract you co-signed
with your brother.

283
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,401
You have one week to
vacate the premises.

284
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,410
I did what you asked me to.
I got you your gold.

285
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,651
There might be a way.

286
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,522
I don't presume to pry, Rupert,
I am just fucking cold is all.

287
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,921
You know what?

288
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,327
I figure you ain't got
much need for this.

289
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,888
As mine dries out.

290
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,403
Thank you, Rupert. Thank you.

291
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,761
Hell. I ain't coming to get you,
if that's what you think.

292
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,287
Least I'll have my hide
if something happens to you.

293
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,481
Samuel!

294
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,607
Samuel!

295
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,887
Samuel!

296
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,241
Samuel!

297
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,167
Samuel!

298
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,650
Samuel!

299
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,761
Mr. Hawkins?

300
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,521
What the hell are you doing here?

301
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,807
What do you want?

302
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,168
I'm looking for my brother.

303
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,084
We was together. You know, when we...

304
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,402
Hey! Hey!

305
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,486
You get your goddamn hand off me,
you understand?

306
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,562
Is that a bear?

307
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,200
You know where he is?

308
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,761
You're gonna take me to him?

309
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,568
Let's go.

310
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,287
In there?

311
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,284
I take it you ain't coming with me.

312
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,522
Samuel.

313
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,322
Samuel!

314
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,688
Samuel. Samuel, get up.

315
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,525
Samuel, it's me!

316
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,206
Wake up, wake up.

317
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,001
It's me.

318
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,565
You stupid son of a bitch.

319
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,008
Lisa would kill me if I didn't get you.

320
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,326
We...

321
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,531
We have to go right now.

322
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,042
Come on.

323
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,522
Samuel, take this.

324
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,247
Go, go, go!

325
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,847
Wyatt!

326
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,123
Samuel

327
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,961
Wyatt!

328
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,487
Let's go.

329
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,928
Have I lived such
a sheltered life, Wyatt?

330
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,246
I used to think it was the gold
that turned men bad,

331
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,006
but now I'm starting to think,

332
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,003
they was just that way to begin with.

333
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,360
I don't want this kind of life
for my son, Wyatt.

334
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,450
I don't... want

335
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,408
to raise him in this kind of world.

336
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,609
It ain't an easy place, this world,
even in the best of times.

337
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,881
Well then I hope damn to make it so.

338
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,327
Or if not easy, at least bearable.

339
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,011
That's a tall order.

340
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,646
The world is as it's always been,

341
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,921
always will be.

342
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,284
God damn your pessimism.

343
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,166
I've seen too much
to believe otherwise, Samuel.

344
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,080
I wish it weren't so.

345
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,723
Jebediah's up there somewhere.

346
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,131
You wanna make
a better world for your boy,

347
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,128
I figure up there
is a good place to start.

348
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,961
We've only got one knife
between the two of us.

349
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,760
We could have come better
equipped is all I'm saying.

350
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,248
Stand back! Let's do it!

351
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,167
I don't care!

352
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,006
State your fucking business.

353
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,170
We're looking for a man
called Jebediah Seagrave.

354
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,480
We' re his sons.

355
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,366
Hey, Jim!

356
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,402
These boys
claim they're kin to Jebediah.

357
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,321
Is that right?

358
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,606
You must be Wyatt.

359
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,527
I am.

360
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,530
The prodigal son.

361
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,731
Prodigal or not, I'm here,
and I'm looking for him.

362
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,007
Where's my father?

363
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,885
He's been expecting you.

364
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:08,763
Daniel!

365
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,561
This base creature dare
to tempt the divine,

366
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,210
having crawled out of the slime
and called himself king,

367
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,090
while God himself is too modest

368
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,924
to make such a boast...

369
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,409
As if He did not foresee this,

370
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,444
or was not cognizant
of every unfolding step

371
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,771
of this dire plot against his kingdom
by his ungrateful progeny,

372
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,962
which, spewing venom and bile,

373
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:40,405
He has ordained that his son's
flesh shall be flayed open

374
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,241
until such a time as his black
heart stops beating

375
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,446
and then and only then can
the worm be brought before Him.

376
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,850
Put your backs into it,
you gutless heathens...

377
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,846
Sons of whores,

378
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,163
unfit to breathe the same air

379
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,521
as these wormy, ill-tempered bitches...

380
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,523
The world is cold and lost to me.

381
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,170
Doesn't matter if I'm warm or not.

382
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,084
It's your mind that lies to you,
not the world.

383
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,001
I assure you the world
remains unchanged.

384
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,049
Do you think Lisa
and the boy are safe?

385
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,687
When I close my eyes, I see her here.

386
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,004
But I fear she is dead.

387
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,164
She ain't dead. She's fine.

388
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,767
Look at your hand.

389
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,808
- Alright, okay.
- Fuck.

390
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,481
- God save us all!
- God save us all!

391
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,966
Come on! Come on!

392
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,161
Everybody, back!

393
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,604
Listen to me, you crazy son of a bitch.

394
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,000
You are going to get your sorry ass up

395
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,721
and you are going
to take us to Jebediah.

396
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,602
You understand?

397
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,770
Do you understand me?

398
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,570
I want them off the land,

399
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,801
upright or otherwise,
it makes no difference to me.

400
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,089
A hundred dollar bonus...

401
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,167
per man...

402
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,281
when the job is done.

403
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,527
Push on.

404
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,201
Crow a tune.

405
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,406
Color even,

406
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,490
for an adversity.

407
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,887
Push on a kiss,

408
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,241
all the colors.

409
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,124
By another name, go on.

410
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,281
I used to sing that to your father.

411
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,122
He liked it, yes he did.

412
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,766
We have to turn back.

413
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,767
How much further?

414
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,365
I fear it's too late.

415
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,051
Answer the goddamn question!
How far is it!

416
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,322
Not far. Not far at all.

417
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,445
I heard you was expecting us.

418
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,285
You came to kill me.

419
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,327
I did.

420
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,130
He came to take you back.

421
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,842
I never amounted to much,
and I doubt that I ever will.

422
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,002
But Samuel is worth saving.

423
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,444
We are the same you and I.

424
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,726
Doomed to live in woe
to labor in darkness.

425
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,810
Like hell we are.

426
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,364
You came to kill me...

427
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,961
Do it.

428
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,561
Samuel.

429
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,529
No. No!

430
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,127
Who are you to judge me?

431
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:19,730
To try to understand and comprehend
that which broods over me?

432
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,927
The burdens I shoulder?

433
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,208
Worlds that I command,

434
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,842
bursting forth in bone
and flesh and blood!

435
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,846
You must be Lisa.

436
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,529
I have here a notice of foreclosure.

437
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,566
Fully notarized.

438
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,047
This... is our land.

439
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,442
None of the lies or false claims
in the world will change that.

440
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,250
Turn your horses and ride off.

441
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,241
Kindly escort
the Seagraves from my property.

442
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,120
Father!

443
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,246
Stop this.

444
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,011
He came here to die.

445
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:19,967
Let him.

446
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,331
Cut him down!

447
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,645
He chose his fate,

448
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,167
just as you have chosen yours.

449
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,886
There's a baby.

450
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,010
Do you not remember me?

451
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,566
Or Wyatt?

452
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,089
I do not recognize you.

453
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,444
There's a baby inside.

454
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,971
Not another step.

455
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,283
I came to take you back.

456
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,083
There's no going back, is there?

457
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,842
Maggie!

458
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,000
There is a woman on the inside.

459
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,682
Howell!

460
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,971
Lisa, Lisa.

461
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,890
Maggie.

462
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:42,406
You wouldn't happen
to have a swig of whiskey on you?

463
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,604
It ain't so bad as I feared.

464
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,690
Don't die, Wyatt.

465
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,441
Wyatt.

466
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,726
Wyatt.

467
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:07,086
I wanted to tell you
how I felt about you, Maggie,

468
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,121
but my own cowardice prevented me,

469
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,044
and now that you're gone,

470
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,526
it's my grief that stops me.

471
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,721
Hey, Sheriff!

472
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,121
What?

473
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,285
Oil.
