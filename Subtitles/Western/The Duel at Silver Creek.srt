1
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,187
<i>For some time there'd been reports
about a vicious gang of claim jumpers...</i>

2
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:26,746
<i>who'd been forcing miners to sign away their
claims through fear of torture or death.</i>

3
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:29,225
<i>The claims were then transferred
to one of their own men...</i>

4
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:32,588
<i>or were sold to innocent miners
who had just arrived in the territory...</i>

5
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:34,586
<i>and were looking
for new claims to work.</i>

6
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:38,630
<i>These claim jumpers were smart enough not
to try to grab some of the bigger mines...</i>

7
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,712
<i>where there might be
enough men working to put up a fight.</i>

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,865
<i>Usually, they picked on the claims
being worked by one or two men...</i>

9
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:56,149
<i>and the more defenceless these men were,
the better the claim jumpers liked it.</i>

10
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,704
<i>Their plan was simple
and foolproof.</i>

11
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:00,711
<i>No one knew
who they were.</i>

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,350
<i>Since their victims either
disappeared or were found dead...</i>

13
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,070
<i>there wasn't anyone who could
put their finger on thesejumpers.</i>

14
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,030
<i>Working a claim became a mighty
dangerous business for any miner...</i>

15
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,714
<i>because no one knew when
or where they'd turn up next.</i>

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,071
Hey, Luke,
come here, quick.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,268
Take a look at this.
- There's enough dust there to blind a man.

18
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:33,266
Looks like we staked one
with some pay dirt this time, son.

19
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,585
It's about time,
hard as we been working.

20
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:37,586
Now you can buy
all the silver you want.

21
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,427
You won't have to go around
playin' poker for it.

22
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,788
I like to play, Dad.

23
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:45,185
You never figure on
losing, do you, son?

24
00:02:45,284 --> 00:02:48,113
Well, if you figured on losing,
you wouldn't be a poker player.

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,066
We must have better
than three ounces here.

26
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:54,545
Take it to town and get it on the scales
before the assayer closes for the day.

27
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,546
I betcha it's
closer to five.

28
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,551
That sure ain't gonna
make me mad.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,985
He's gettin' ready
to move out.

30
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,594
Bill. Lenny.
Take care of'em.

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,307
I'll wait supper for you,
but don't get in no poker game...

32
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:52,508
or it'll be breakfast time
before you get back.

33
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,114
If I do play, I promise
to win as fast as I can.

34
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,116
Hi.
- Howdy.

35
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,150
Any luck?
- Oh, there's lots richer pickings around, I guess.

36
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,595
Well, then you won't mind
signing over your claim.

37
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,871
For how much?
- Let's say one dollar... just to make it legal.

38
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,386
What are you up to anyway?
Get off my land before I...

39
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:52,234
Now look, you're gonna sign.
Why don't you make it easy on yourself?

40
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,830
I'm not signin' anything.

41
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,311
Change
your mind?

42
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,386
I told you
I'm not signin'...

43
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:04,705
Maybe you'd
like to sign now.

44
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,706
Maybe we're wastin'
our time, boss.

45
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,908
Just what
I was thinkin'.

46
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,037
You know, this mine is no
good to you if you're dead.

47
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,226
What do we do
with him now, boss?

48
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:25,950
Get him out of here.
We'll dump him in the arroyo.

49
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:29,191
I wonder what's holding up those guys.
- Here comes Bill now.

50
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,239
<i>That's not Bill! Leave him!
Leave him! Get movin'!</i>

51
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,947
<i>Then old man Tompkins struck it rich
a few miles north of Silver City...</i>

52
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:33,345
<i>and thejumpers moved in
and killed him.</i>

53
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:35,388
<i>As usual, they made
a clean getaway...</i>

54
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,110
<i>but this time they left a trail
I thought we could follow...</i>

55
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,876
<i>and as I was marshal of Silver City, I
decided to get up a posse to track them down.</i>

56
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,585
<i>Lightning.</i>

57
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:01,667
How 'bout lettin' me hold on to the marshal
job while you're out huntin' them claim jumpers?

58
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:05,507
I don't know, Dan. I'm afraid there wouldn't
be a man left without a hole in his skin...

59
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,868
with a famous old gunfighter
like you on the job.

60
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:13,346
You mean to say I'm not as fast on the draw as you are?
- I mean nothing of the sort.

61
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:17,427
You should. It's the truth... even if I did
teach you everything you know about a gun...

62
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:20,150
ever since you was big enough
to pull a trigger.

63
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:22,790
But I'm older now,
a mite slower on the draw.

64
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,025
Only a mite, Pop.
- The way I figure...

65
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:28,708
you've already tamed most of these
itchy-fingered hotheads around here...

66
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:31,307
to where I can ride herd
on 'em 'til you get back.

67
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:34,705
All right, Pop. Go into the office
and get one of those deputy badges.

68
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:38,989
Thank you, son. I knew you'd
say that, so I already took one.

69
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,038
Don't you worry about
a thing while you're gone.

70
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,548
<i>Lightnin;</i>

71
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:48,945
Well, is that sack for me to bring back
the claim jumpers' scalps in?

72
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,946
Uh-uh. Smoked venison.
- Oh.

73
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:53,670
You might be gone for a long time.
- I might at that. Thanks, Dusty.

74
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:56,479
You take care of me better
than many a wife I know of.

75
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,748
Johnny Sombrero looks
mighty happy about somethin'.

76
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:08,347
Maybe it's because the
marshal's leaving Silver City.

77
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:10,351
Hey, Johnny Sombrero.

78
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,867
How 'bout joinin' the posse, Johnny? Give
you a chance to use that shootin' iron legal.

79
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:23,547
My gal don't want me to leave town.
- Which gal?

80
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,025
All of them
good-lookin' female gals.

81
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:29,628
They say, should something happen to
Johnny Sombrero, their hearts would break.

82
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,626
Don't you go lookin' at me
when you say that.

83
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:34,626
If anything was to happen to you,
Johnny, I'd say good riddance.

84
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,068
Don't go botherin' Dusty
while I'm gone, understand?

85
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:41,067
Didn't know it was marshal's job to tell a
fellow what females he can interest himself in.

86
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,428
In this case,
I'm making it my job.

87
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:47,629
If you hold another opinion, you're welcome
to try to do something about it... right now.

88
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:50,509
Think I'd be loony enough
to draw on you, Marshal?

89
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,955
No. Not while
I'm looking at you.

90
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,825
I'm glad Johnny ain't
goin' with you, Lightnin'.

91
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,065
Be easy for him to put
a bullet in your back.

92
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:04,709
It's a wonder he passed up the chance.
Maybe he's got something else in mind.

93
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,271
We're ready to
move out, Marshal.

94
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,871
Bye, Dusty.

95
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,791
All right, let's go.

96
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,470
Get goin'!
Get goin'!

97
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,028
Hey! There's
a posse comin'!

98
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,078
How many? Clear out!
- About 20 of'em.

99
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,948
<i>The posse lost
them in the chase.</i>

100
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:33,069
<i>They tried to pick up
the trail again but had no luck.</i>

101
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:36,907
<i>We were near Fort Lowell when I took
the bullet through my right shoulder.</i>

102
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:40,959
<i>So they dropped me off at the army hospital
there, and they went back to Silver City.</i>

103
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,026
That's not very good
for a marshal, is it?

104
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,106
I could do better
with my left foot.

105
00:14:02,205 --> 00:14:04,830
Sometimes it feels like
it doesn't even belong to me.

106
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:08,390
How much longer do I have to hang around here, Doc?
- Well, let's have a look.

107
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,704
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

108
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,786
Well, it seems to be
healing nicely.

109
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:17,713
I'll take the bandage off by the end of the week.
- Oh, good.

110
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,866
Ooh.
- Does it hurt?

111
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,946
No, not really.
It's just a little stiff.

112
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:26,186
Well, it may be for a while.
Just keep massaging it.

113
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:28,947
<i>Sheriff's coming.
Who's that on the horn?</i>

114
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:30,946
Looks like a goner to me.

115
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,554
Who you got there, Sheriff?
- Tom Peters.

116
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,590
Claim jumpers did it.
Left him for dead.

117
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,830
<i>I hope the doc
can pull him around.</i>

118
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,669
Found him lyin' at the edge
of Coyote Springs more dead than alive.

119
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,708
Get him inside.

120
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:06,105
Do what you can for him,
will ya, Doc?

121
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,106
He saw
the claim jumpers.

122
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:11,186
Told me he could recognize 'em.
Then he passed out.

123
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,186
Be a mighty handy man
to have alive.

124
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,589
He'll be the first
living witness we've ever had.

125
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,875
Easy. Easy with him.

126
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,356
Thank you, boys.

127
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,269
Excuse me, ma'am.

128
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:33,665
Perhaps I could be of help.
I've had some training as a nurse.

129
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:37,465
If it's one thing I need around here, it's
help. Make him as comfortable as you can.

130
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:41,155
I have to probe for the bullets.
- Sure hope we can save that poor devil, Doc.

131
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,146
Would you get me
some water, please?

132
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,151
Oh, sure.

133
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,505
He's dead.

134
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:23,511
I'll tell the sheriff.

135
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,268
I guess he was farther gone
than I thought.

136
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,706
I'm sorry
for what happened.

137
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:05,627
I know how much it would've meant to you
and the sheriff had he lived.

138
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:08,147
It was kind of you to
help, miss. Or is it Mrs?

139
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:11,029
Miss.
Miss Opal Lacey.

140
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:14,548
And you're the famous Marshal Tyrone
of Silver City, aren't you?

141
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:16,546
"Famous" is
a pretty big word.

142
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,669
I'm afraid most people call me
a lot of other things.

143
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:23,465
I heard you were wounded. I
hope it's nothing serious, Mr Tyrone.

144
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,668
"Mr" Tyrone.
My friends call me...

145
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:29,544
I know, "Lightning. " I've heard all about
how fast you are with a gun.

146
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:32,190
As a matter of fact,
I know quite a bit about you.

147
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:37,145
And I don't know anything about you.
Isn't that a bit one-sided, Miss Lacey?

148
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:39,146
My friends call me Opal.

149
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:41,428
Well, they can't be
very friendly then.

150
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,905
If I knew ya real well,
I'd call you...

151
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,948
I'd call you Brown Eyes.

152
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,600
Brown Eyes.
I like that.

153
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,666
When are you returning
to Silver City?

154
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,746
As soon as I can get
this arm out of this sling.

155
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:59,029
I hope it'll be soon. I'm on my
way there now to join my brother.

156
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,468
You did say your brother?
- Yes.

157
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:04,706
He's a mining engineer. He's
just opened an office in Silver City.

158
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,109
<i>Oh.
- Let's get on, folks.</i>

159
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,705
I hope you'll
visit me in Silver City.

160
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:13,829
Brown Eyes, you're gonna find me
a nuisance when I get back.

161
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:18,748
Why?
- Because I'm gonna be sitting on your doorstep every spare minute I get.

162
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,789
In that case, I'll make certain
my house has a doorstep.

163
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,791
Bye, Lightning.
- Bye.

164
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,351
Evenin'.
- Good evenin', Harvey.

165
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,104
Good evenin', Dave. -
Hi. Hi. - Evenin', Dan.

166
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:48,548
Evening, Tim.

167
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,945
How's Lightnin' gettin' along?
- Well, of course...

168
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:54,149
he can't hardly wait to get home,
but that doctor at Fort Lowell...

169
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:57,588
won't let him travel none
'til his wound's all healed.

170
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,065
I got a letter from him
just this noon.

171
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:03,428
Who read it to ya, Pop?
- Dusty.

172
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:07,470
Why, you spavin cayuse! Are you
trying to say that I can't read?

173
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:11,909
Oh, of course not, Pop. Well, it's just that
your eyes ain't as good as they used to be.

174
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:16,349
Well, maybe they're not so good for readin',
but they're still good enough for shootin'.

175
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,028
Oh, don't get mad, Pop. I know
you're still plenty quick with a gun.

176
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:22,509
Well, just so you don't
forget it. Hm.

177
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,747
Ahh!

178
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,788
Goodnight. Goodnight, boys.
- Goodnight, Dan.

179
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:31,786
<i>Goodnight.
- Goodnight.</i>

180
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:34,307
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

181
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,386
You know, that old galoot
still thinks he can draw.

182
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,675
The only thing he
can draw is a picture.

183
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,751
Shot in the back.

184
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,308
He drew all right,
but he never had a chance.

185
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,625
Well, whoever did this
sure picked a perfect night.

186
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:08,147
We'll never be able
to find his tracks in the rain.

187
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,465
I wonder what Lightning
will do when he hears about this.

188
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,869
Well, I'd sure hate to be
the guy that plugged him.

189
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,386
Hi, Lightning.
How ya feeling?

190
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:30,391
Fine, Ben. Just fine.

191
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,113
Hiya, Will.
- Glad to see you back, Lightnin'.

192
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,586
Hi, Dusty.
- Pa! Pa, Lightning's back.

193
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:54,906
Hello, Pete.
- Pa and me's been worried sick since we heard ya took a bullet.

194
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,508
All that worrying's gonna make you old
before your time, Dusty. How are ya?

195
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,905
How is your arm?
- Oh, good as ever.

196
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:02,911
How's Dan been
behavin' himself?

197
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,466
What's the matter?
Pop's all right, isn't he?

198
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:15,706
He was found dead.
Shot in the back.

199
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:17,988
Shot...

200
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:20,827
<i>When?
- Three days ago.</i>

201
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,826
I'm sorry, Lightnin'. I know how much you thought of Pop.
- Who did it?

202
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:27,146
Nobody knows. It happened out in front
of the Blue Goose at night.

203
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,545
Oh, that's great.
That's just great.

204
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:32,829
Pop gets shot and nobody makes a move
to find out who killed him.

205
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:36,625
The rain was pilin' down when it happened.
Washed all the signs out from around his body.

206
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:41,628
Yeah. Whoever did it must've been desperate
for money. They took the gold nugget off him.

207
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:43,908
I think I'll have a talk
with Johnny Sombrero.

208
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,747
Funny thing about Johnny... up and got
himself a steady job right after you left.

209
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:50,986
Nobody can prove he had anything to do with it.
- Maybe I can.

210
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:53,544
Lightnin'.

211
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,270
Johnny's been talkin' big since word
got around you were wounded.

212
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,266
He figures it's bound
to have slowed you down.

213
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:00,555
I never had much respect
for Johnny's figurin'.

214
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,309
<i>I hoped I still had
the Indian sign on Johnny.</i>

215
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:13,510
<i>Sure, I could draw as fast as ever,
but I couldn't squeeze the trigger.</i>

216
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,549
<i>But Pop had been killed, and I had a feeling
Johnny'd done it, and I had to find out... now.</i>

217
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,791
That's him now.

218
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,184
Who killed Dan Musick?
- Why ask me? I guess he couldn't find his gun.

219
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:34,389
He didn't have a chance. He was
shot in the back. Where were you?

220
00:22:34,488 --> 00:22:38,996
I was five miles out, working as a guide
for the Acme mines. That's their office.

221
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,308
I'll check that,
and if you're lying to me...

222
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:44,508
You don't think I'd lie
to you, do you, Marshal?

223
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:48,108
<i>I wouldn't advise it, unless you're
thinking that bullet slowed my draw.</i>

224
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:51,106
<i>Has it?
- There's a sure way to find out.</i>

225
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:54,788
Uh-uh. I've reformed...
but my friend here hasn't.

226
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:58,714
His name's Blake, from Tombstone,
and he don't like marshals.

227
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,630
Maybe there's a good reason
why you don't like marshals.

228
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,147
None of'em live long enough
for us to get acquainted.

229
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:08,625
You've been meeting the wrong kind of marshals.
- I don't think I have.

230
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:11,025
I told you the marshal
was a mighty sudden gent.

231
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:14,715
If you're in Silver City after sundown,
rat face, I'll throw you in jail.

232
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,631
Gimme that gun!
- Not now!

233
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,150
Excuse me. Can you
tell me who the, uh...

234
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,667
Well, Brown Eyes.
- Welcome home, Lightning.

235
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,470
You working here?
- Not exactly. I'm just helping my brother.

236
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,705
Oh, this is your brother's place, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:42,307
He's inside. I'm glad to
see that your arm is better.

238
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:44,545
Well, thanks. I'd like
to talk to your brother.

239
00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:47,829
Won't I do?
- Maybe you will at that.

240
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:51,109
<i>I'm here to find out if a Johnny
Sombrero is working for this outfit.</i>

241
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,910
<i>He is.
- Oh, this is my brother, Rod.</i>

242
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:55,906
<i>This is the marshal
of Silver City.</i>

243
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,550
So you're the famous Lightning.
Heard a lot about you.

244
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,748
Glad to know you.
- What do you wanna know about Johnny?

245
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:02,746
I wanna know how long
he's been with you.

246
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:06,827
I put him on the day after I got here.
I needed a guide; he knows the country.

247
00:24:06,926 --> 00:24:09,305
Why? You got anything against him?
- Nothing I can prove.

248
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:12,546
I just have a hunch he had something to do
with the killing of Dan Musick.

249
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:16,308
Oh, he couldn't have. He was acting guide
for me at the time of the shooting.

250
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:19,668
Have you talked to the Silver Kid yet?
- Never heard of him.

251
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:22,826
<i>Opal, you shouldn't repeat idle gossip.
- What gossip?</i>

252
00:24:22,926 --> 00:24:25,986
She heard the Silver Kid could've
done it because he rode into town...

253
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:28,225
the day before
this Dan Musick was shot.

254
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:32,307
Silver Kid, huh?
Thanks for telling me. See ya.

255
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,545
Lightning.

256
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:37,509
They say the Silver Kid is
awfully fast with his guns.

257
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,556
Thanks for the warning,
Brown Eyes.

258
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,467
I hope the Silver Kid is
as fast as they say he is.

259
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:49,270
We'll soon know.
- Nice-looking fella.

260
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:52,665
Yes, he's attractive.
- Interested?

261
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:55,347
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

262
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:59,194
My only interest in him is to make certain
he doesn't get in our way.

263
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,517
Gimme a bottle.
- When d'ya get back in Silver Creek?

264
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,507
Glad you dropped in, Lightnin'.
I heard you come back.

265
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,948
Sorry about ol' Dan.

266
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:26,026
Do you know anything about a
stranger called the Silver Kid?

267
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,026
Not much, except I'd hate
to tangle with him.

268
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:31,425
Though he looks like he ain't dry behind the ears yet.
- Where can I find him?

269
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:35,789
Where he usually is... over there.
Doing all right for himself too.

270
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:38,148
<i>He didn't have
the face of a killer...</i>

271
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:40,508
<i>but he had the cold,
steel look of one.</i>

272
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,909
<i>I noticed his hands
were quick and sure.</i>

273
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,116
Bettin' 40.

274
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,231
Your 40,
and 40 bucks again.

275
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,026
Call it.
- Three aces.

276
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,830
It costs money to learn to play poker, Kid.
- It sure does.

277
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,948
It looks like it's gonna
cost you plenty to learn...

278
00:26:02,048 --> 00:26:05,388
because three aces don't beat
three treys and two deuces.

279
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:08,386
When are you gonna
start shavin', Kid?

280
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:10,987
When you buzzards learn
to play poker, maybe.

281
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:14,508
<i>Talks like
a man, don't he?</i>

282
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:16,788
Wears a couple
of shootin' irons too.

283
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:21,990
Well, I'll bet he's a real tough hombre...
when his ma's around to protect him.

284
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,630
I wouldn't crowd too far
if I was you, sheep dip.

285
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,439
Sheep dip?
Why, you...

286
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,986
Thanks for
the winnings, gents.

287
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:34,991
I'll be back later.

288
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,751
Better come with me.

289
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,187
Let's see your pouch.

290
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:12,953
What's the matter? You short of cash?
- Sit down.

291
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,588
<i>I hardly expected to come across
Dan's nugget in the Kid's pouch...</i>

292
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,586
<i>but I wasn't going
to overlook anything.</i>

293
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:25,986
<i>The Kid could've been cocky enough to carry
it on him, if he was the one who plugged Dan.</i>

294
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:29,668
A man I thought a heap of
was shot in the back a few days ago.

295
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,145
His name was Dan Musick.

296
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:34,465
There's some folks in town
think you might've done it.

297
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:38,185
What do you think?
- I'm asking you, Kid.

298
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:40,787
I don't shoot men
in the back, Marshal.

299
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:43,627
The only time I draw
is when I'm crowded.

300
00:27:43,726 --> 00:27:46,184
I didn't kill
this Dan Musick.

301
00:27:46,284 --> 00:27:49,346
Any more questions?
- Yeah.

302
00:27:49,446 --> 00:27:53,224
What's your name? And I
don't mean "Silver Kid. "

303
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:55,226
Cromwell.
Luke Cromwell.

304
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,668
Where ya from?
- Santa Fe.

305
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:00,390
Santa Fe, huh?
- Is that all?

306
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:02,828
'Cause I'm losin' a lot of money
sittin' around here.

307
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:04,906
Just a minute.

308
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:08,545
I'm probably wasting my breath,
but I'm gonna give you some advice.

309
00:28:08,644 --> 00:28:12,105
Get outta town pronto.
Get yourself a job and quit poker.

310
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:14,228
Poker's a man's game.
- I can take care of myself.

311
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:16,668
Oh, sure, I know you're
fast with your guns...

312
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:19,949
but sooner or later you'll meet a man
who's faster... or who doesn't fight square.

313
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:24,149
Then you move to Boot Hill. You're buckin'
a sucker's game, Kid. You can't beat it.

314
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:28,589
I guess that's good advice,
Marshal, but I ain't takin' it.

315
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:32,028
Besides, how to handle a six-gun
and poker is all I know.

316
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,468
There is a way to stop them
riding you when you play poker, Kid.

317
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:37,755
That I sure would
like to hear.

318
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,345
<i>I wasn't interested in his poker...</i>

319
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:44,309
<i>but I was interested
in the way he handled a six-gun.</i>

320
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:47,189
<i>An idea hit me.
I needed a right hand...</i>

321
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:49,947
<i>and he had the
fastest one I ever saw.</i>

322
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:52,670
You like silver,
don't you, Kid?

323
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:56,188
They won't be so quick to ride you
with that pinned to your jacket.

324
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:59,229
What's the catch?
- No catch. I got my reasons... two of'em.

325
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:02,945
One is to keep you out of trouble.
The other is, with you covering my back...

326
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:06,947
I'll have a better chance of staying right-side
up 'til I square things for Dan Musick.

327
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,829
Pa wanted me to ask if you'd...
- Dusty, this is the Silver Kid.

328
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:13,508
He's gonna be my new deputy.
- Kinda young to be a deputy.

329
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:16,549
He handles his guns
like an old-timer.

330
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:18,546
Any objections to me
being a deputy?

331
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:21,025
None, so long as you
ride protection on Lightnin'.

332
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:22,909
That's just what
I aim to do.

333
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:25,348
Just be careful
where you aim.

334
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,070
Pa said for me to ask you
to have supper with us.

335
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,066
Oh, thanks, Dusty.
Be glad to.

336
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,827
Say, a deputy gets hungry,
too, you know.

337
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:35,309
Oh, I think we can stretch
the vittles for one more.

338
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,546
That your girl?
- Who? Dusty?

339
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,546
She's like a kid sister. I've
known her since the day she was born.

340
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:46,270
She don't look at you like no kid sister.
- Oh, you're seein' things.

341
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,266
Come on.
Let's get washed up.

342
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:50,271
You can bunk there.

343
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,505
Say, are you sure a deputy's
allowed to play poker?

344
00:29:54,604 --> 00:29:58,826
Nothing in the regulations that says he can't.
Thinking of riding Lady Luck after supper?

345
00:29:58,926 --> 00:30:02,428
Yeah. If I'm half as lucky as
you are, I'm bound to clean up.

346
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:04,426
What do you mean
by that?

347
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,550
A wound like that's likely to put a man's
shootin' arm plumb out of action.

348
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:11,393
I always was
a lucky hombre.

349
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,468
Lightning.

350
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,110
Well, hello.
- Care to have supper with me?

351
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,388
Tonight? I wish you'd have
asked me earlier.

352
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:26,386
The Kid and I are invited
to eat at Pete Fargo's.

353
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:28,386
I must be losing my charm.

354
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:31,269
Anytime you lose your charm,
Brown Eyes, I'll be glad to look for it.

355
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,266
My brother's working late
at the assayer's office.

356
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,308
Why don't I come over after supper?
- Good.

357
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:37,827
I hated the thought
of spending the evening alone.

358
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:39,831
Bye.
- Bye.

359
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,068
You're gonna get a bellyache
eatin' that fast.

360
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:52,624
Oh, me? I always eat fast.
- Yeah.

361
00:30:52,724 --> 00:30:56,547
Especially when there's a fancy filly sittin'
all alone waitin' for him to come over.

362
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:00,866
What filly?
- The one they call Miss Lacey but he calls Brown Eyes.

363
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:03,909
The only thing bigger than
your ears, Kid, is your mouth.

364
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:06,065
Gonna see her
after supper?

365
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,870
Her brother's workin' late.
She's kinda scared to be alone.

366
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:11,510
You sure that's in
the line of duty, Marshal?

367
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,912
Look, Kid, your job is to see I don't get
a bullet in the back. That's all, understand?

368
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,545
<i>You stuck on that filly?
- Dusty...</i>

369
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,466
you got no right to call
that lady a filly.

370
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:24,836
Seems to me she got no right
to call that filly a lady.

371
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,120
All right,
that's enough.

372
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,631
<i>Goodnight.
- Goodnight.</i>

373
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,360
Oh, thanks
for the supper, Dusty.

374
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,791
<i>It was
a good supper.</i>

375
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,308
You know, I've seen
fancy dressers like her before.

376
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:53,025
They can do more harm to a man
sometimes than a pair of six-shooters.

377
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:55,308
Anyway, I'm glad he didn't
ask me to go with him.

378
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:58,945
Why?
- Hm. Rather stay here and talk to you.

379
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:02,345
What about?
- Nothing. Just... Just talk.

380
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:06,028
Talking's a waste of time unless you're
doin' somethin' else at the same time.

381
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:08,265
Yeah? Like what,
for instance?

382
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:10,555
Oh, like for instance,
helpin' me wipe these dishes.

383
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,506
Go on, put that apron around you and get busy.
- Just a minute, Dusty...

384
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,985
Ya ate, didn't ya?
Now wipe.

385
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:25,147
You say one word about this to anybody,
you won't be able to sit down for a week.

386
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:27,151
Ya understand that?

387
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,587
Remember, they'll be comin' out
soon after Lacey goes in, so be ready.

388
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:36,355
I'll be waitin' for him.
- And don't miss. He never misses.

389
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,907
Evidently, you don't like cake.
- Oh.

390
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:07,993
I always eat slow.
- Good. That means you'll spend more time here.

391
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,185
I don't need an excuse
to spend more time here.

392
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:16,548
Remember what I said at Fort Lowell?
That I'd be parkin' on your doorstep?

393
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:18,908
Well, if you insist
on the doorstep.

394
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,986
Oh, no. I find this
lots friendlier.

395
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:22,986
So do I.

396
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,668
Certainly friendlier than the way you stormed
into my brother's office this afternoon.

397
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:30,348
Brown Eyes, had I known you were there,
I'd have been on my best behaviour.

398
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:32,904
But I had a lot on my mind,
some quick decisions to make.

399
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:34,986
Obviously.

400
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:36,986
What do you mean
by that?

401
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:40,385
Well, making the Silver Kid your deputy
was not only a quick decision...

402
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,625
but kind of a reckless one,
too, don't you think?

403
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:47,069
Oh, there's nothing wrong with the Kid
that a little growing up won't cure.

404
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:49,146
But isn't it dangerous
to make him your deputy...

405
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:51,465
particularly when he's
suspected of the killing?

406
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:55,430
Who? The Kid? Oh, no, he couldn't
possibly have anything to do with it.

407
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:58,426
Well, if you don't suspect him,
then whom do you suspect?

408
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:01,347
Johnny Sombrero. I just
can't swallow his alibi.

409
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:04,070
But Johnny was with my brother.
They camped out all that night.

410
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,428
They were only five miles out. Johnny
coulda ridden into town and back again...

411
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:10,506
while your brother was sleeping...
or he coulda put Blake up to it.

412
00:34:10,606 --> 00:34:14,639
<i>Blake? - Some trigger-happy kid.
Seems to be a sidekick ofJohnny's.</i>

413
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,467
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get into this kind of talk.

414
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:21,270
Don't be sorry.
I'm interested.

415
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:24,107
Interested in me
or in what I do?

416
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:26,555
<i>Both.</i>

417
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,035
Well, I guess I've taken up
enough of your time.

418
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,466
Do ya have to leave now?

419
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:42,786
No, I don't have to. I just
don't want to wear out my welcome.

420
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:46,185
You're welcome here anytime.
Stay until my brother gets home.

421
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:50,239
You know, I like your brother,
especially when he's out.

422
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,030
So do I.

423
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,265
Well.

424
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,505
Next time, I'll stay
at the office later.

425
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:05,188
Next time I'll start earlier.
- I may have something to say about that.

426
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:08,149
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Lightning.

427
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:11,306
I have a hunch you two would like me
to work late more often.

428
00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:13,834
Always play your hunches,
Lacey. Goodnight.

429
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,593
<i>Lightning, you all right?
- Yeah.</i>

430
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,586
That you doin'
the shootin', Kid?

431
00:35:38,685 --> 00:35:40,586
Naw, it's some
bushwhacker back there.

432
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,906
I was a mite slow bendin'
my gun over his head, but here's his.

433
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:46,986
Thanks for savin' my hide, Kid.
Let's take a look at him.

434
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:50,868
Lightning! - The Kid just
got himself a two-legged coyote.

435
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,586
Who is he?
- His name's Blake. "Rat Face" suits him better.

436
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:04,985
Is he dead?
- Come on. Tell the lady you ain't dead, Rat Face.

437
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:07,630
Come on.
Tell her!

438
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,748
Get me a doctor quick.
You want me to die?

439
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:12,028
You want me to answer that?
- Why'd you wanna plug me?

440
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,106
Thought you were
somebody else. I made a mistake.

441
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,425
Same kind of mistake you made
when you killed Dan Musick.

442
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:19,549
<i>You couldn't pin that killing
on Johnny, so now you pin it on me.</i>

443
00:36:19,648 --> 00:36:21,828
You can't do it. I didn't
hit this stinkin' town...

444
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:25,549
Before I get through with you
you'll be sorry you hit it at all.

445
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,545
That half-wit. He had a clean shot
at him, and he missed.

446
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:38,509
If the Kid hadn't interfered,
Blake would've gotten him.

447
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:41,826
I could swear I've
run into him before.

448
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:44,347
You think Blake will talk?
- He won't.

449
00:36:44,447 --> 00:36:49,827
You better make sure. Sitting in jail for a
long time can sometimes loosen a man's tongue.

450
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:51,990
He won't be in jail
that long.

451
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,348
You find anything?
- No.

452
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:05,868
Well, it might help if you tell
your deputy what you're lookin' for.

453
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:08,670
When I find it, I'll tell ya.
- Easy, Doc.

454
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,666
There. That's
the last stitch.

455
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:13,587
If you'd hit him harder,
you'd have saved me a lotta work.

456
00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:16,399
What are you doing?
Quit tearin' my shirt.

457
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,994
Lightning. Ya ever see
one of these before?

458
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,504
Yeah. The jumpers use these
to identify themselves.

459
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:32,985
<i>I know.
- How do you know, Kid?</i>

460
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:36,508
Some time ago, me and my dad
had a little claim up in the Tomahawks.

461
00:37:36,608 --> 00:37:41,029
One day, some skunks forced my dad to sign
over the claim, and... then they shot him.

462
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:45,745
<i>I went after them and managed to get one of
them before they shot my horse out from under me.</i>

463
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:49,465
One of them had a doodad like this
around his dirty neck.

464
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:51,748
Why did you kill
Dan Musick? Talk fast!

465
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:54,304
I didn't do it.
- How many more jumpers are with you?

466
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:57,626
Never heard of'em.
- Maybe your branding iron on his belly might jog his memory.

467
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:01,269
There's another way to make him talk,
worse than using a branding iron.

468
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,185
<i>I had a hunch
that thejumpers...</i>

469
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,186
<i>would try to break Rat Face
out ofjail or fill him full of lead...</i>

470
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:13,150
<i>so he couldn't tell embarrassing things,
like who their leader was.</i>

471
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,987
<i>So we sneaked him to the ranch Pop had
left me, where I picked up my foreman.</i>

472
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:21,546
<i>I had in mind a cave that was
just made to order for Rat Face.</i>

473
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:23,588
There. That oughta
hold the little buzzard.

474
00:38:23,688 --> 00:38:26,028
This place stinks rattlesnakes.
You ain't gonna leave me here?

475
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:29,628
Yeah. Rattlesnakes crawl in here
kinda thick during the heat of the day.

476
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,748
<i>If a rattler bit you,
he'd probably die.</i>

477
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:34,304
Ready to talk? This is
your last chance, Rat Face.

478
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:36,785
I ain't scared, and I ain't talkin'.
- Abe'll look in on ya...

479
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:38,786
to see if you're
ready to talk.

480
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:40,945
If I don't hear
from him in 48 hours...

481
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:43,185
I'm passin' the word
around town where you're hidden.

482
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:46,069
Folks in Silver City
thought a heap of Dan Musick.

483
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:49,705
They'd like nothing better than
to string up one of you claim jumpers.

484
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:53,547
You ain't gonna lynch nobody. I know too
much. Besides, lynching's against the law.

485
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,995
So is shooting marshals
in the back.

486
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,958
Turn 'im into the corral, Kid.
Pete'll unsaddle 'im.

487
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,145
Well. What do you think
you're doing?

488
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:22,226
Guardin' the prisoner
what ain't.

489
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:24,226
Why? Doc Hardgrove
been talking?

490
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:28,866
Talkin' to me. Everybody else still thinks
you got Rat Face back there.

491
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:32,069
Johnny Sombrero and Tinhorn
are tryin' to whip up a lynchin' mob.

492
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:34,667
I figure a couple of loads
of buckshot oughta scatter 'em.

493
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,187
You scatter on home, Dusty.
We'll take care of the guardin'.

494
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:40,149
Don't want a pretty gal like you
gettin' all messed up.

495
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:44,472
<i>Know somethin', Lightnin'? That's the first
time you ever admitted I was a gal.</i>

496
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,665
Know somethin'?
I must be real smart.

497
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:53,507
I figured she was a gal the first time I ever saw her.
- Maybe you're smart enough...

498
00:39:53,607 --> 00:39:56,549
to figure out who'll get here first,
the lynching mob or the jumpers.

499
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:59,706
Maybe I can, but right now I'm gonna
keep Dusty a little company.

500
00:39:59,806 --> 00:40:01,711
I figure there's
no objections.

501
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,351
Hey, Dusty!

502
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,506
Mind if I walk you home?

503
00:40:13,605 --> 00:40:17,593
Thank you, and now you can walk yourself
right back to Lightnin'. He might need you.

504
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,069
Just brushin' that chip off your shoulder.
You know we're both holdin' the same cards.

505
00:40:24,168 --> 00:40:28,190
Maybe if you got your mind off poker once
in a while I might be able to understand you.

506
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:32,426
Look, Dusty, Lightning's so blinded by
Brown Eyes, he can't even see your shadow.

507
00:40:32,526 --> 00:40:35,027
You're so blinded by Lightning,
you can't even see mine.

508
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:38,149
So that gives us something
in common... same cards.

509
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:40,987
Maybe I oughta learn
to play poker better.

510
00:40:41,086 --> 00:40:43,108
What you oughta do
is get outta this game.

511
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,186
If you do, we both stand
a chance of winning.

512
00:40:45,285 --> 00:40:48,238
If you don't, we both
wind up holding dead hands.

513
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,311
I better go inside.

514
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,306
Hi, Carl.
- Hi.

515
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:15,147
Here. This oughta blow it
into the next county.

516
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:17,305
What about the marshal
and that kid he deputized?

517
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:19,306
Johnny Sombrero will
take care of them.

518
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:22,386
Johnny's fixing it so the marshal
will have his hands full.

519
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:25,546
Just so they're outta the way.
- You have nothing to worry about.

520
00:41:25,646 --> 00:41:27,705
Just grab him and
wait for us back here.

521
00:41:27,805 --> 00:41:29,748
Come on.

522
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:31,751
Come on!

523
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,905
I'll tell you
what'll happen to him.

524
00:41:40,005 --> 00:41:44,668
He'll go to jail for a little while. Then
he'll be free to take up where he left off.

525
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:48,949
<i>Johnny's right. Them claim jumpers
go around killin' with a free hand.</i>

526
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,105
<i>What happens to 'em
when they get caught?</i>

527
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:54,628
Why, they stick 'em in some
nice, warm, comfortable jail.

528
00:41:54,728 --> 00:41:58,467
It don't seem right to me
to let a claim jumper off that easy.

529
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:02,387
That's what I say. They're a bunch
of murdering rats, the lot of'em!

530
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,706
If I had my way,
they'd all hang.

531
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:07,706
Well, why don't we
string 'em up?

532
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:10,589
<i>We been putting up with this long enough.
- Let's get 'em.</i>

533
00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:13,319
<i>Yeah!</i>

534
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,396
Lightning! Lightning!

535
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,668
There's a lynch mob
coming after Blake.

536
00:42:52,768 --> 00:42:54,666
Remember, no shooting
unless they start it.

537
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:58,428
Lightning, don't take any chances. If you
can't talk them out of it, let them have Blake.

538
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:01,956
Don't worry about me, Brown Eyes. Get on home before they get here.
- Be careful.

539
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,032
You can count on me,
Lightnin'.

540
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,466
That's close enough.
- You're giving us Blake, or do we bust in?

541
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:46,546
How come you're in this, Johnny?
Yesterday, Blake was a friend of yours.

542
00:43:46,646 --> 00:43:51,425
That was yesterday. I didn't know then he
was one of the jumpers. Now hand him over.

543
00:43:51,525 --> 00:43:56,028
I'm handing nobody over. Blake's done
some talking. At his trial, he'll do more.

544
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:59,192
We'll hold trial
after we've strung him up.

545
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,546
I'm warning you, Lightning.
We're coming in.

546
00:44:02,645 --> 00:44:05,234
I got a load of buckshot
waitin' for you, Johnny.

547
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,269
Opal told me you're in trouble.
- And Johnny's makin' most of it.

548
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:17,388
I don't hold with
lawlessness, Johnny.

549
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:21,519
Just wanna give this jumper a piece of his own medicine.
- That's the marshal's job.

550
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,987
Don't listen to him, Johnny.
- Shut up, Tinhorn.

551
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:32,108
I got respect
for what Mr Lacey says.

552
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:34,111
I'm stringing
with him.

553
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,390
Blake gets his neck
stretched after the trial.

554
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,195
Give us a hand here!

555
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,953
Watch the walls.
The jumpers got Blake!

556
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,670
We're gonna go after 'em, Lightnin'.
- Never find 'em in the dark.

557
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,666
Too bad they got Blake.

558
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:23,513
Outside of him, we wouldn't know
who to look for anyway.

559
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,907
See, Lightning? If you hadn't butted in,
Blake'd be dangling from a rope.

560
00:45:32,006 --> 00:45:35,428
Now he live to put a bullet in your back.
- That's enough, Johnny.

561
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:39,108
Marshal was only doing his duty. Go home
and get some sleep before you get in trouble.

562
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:43,905
That goes for all of ya.
- Anything you say, Mr Lacey. Come on, Tinhorn.

563
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:46,949
We'll get some boys in the morning,
see if we can't follow their tracks.

564
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:49,345
Good idea.
- I appreciate the way you backed me up.

565
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:52,666
I'd have been in hot water
with Opal if I hadn't. Goodnight.

566
00:45:52,765 --> 00:45:54,666
Goodnight.

567
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:57,187
One of'em will be ridin'
high and wide but not handsome.

568
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,787
I put a load of buckshot into his britches.
- Thanks, Dusty.

569
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:02,344
Whenever I need another deputy,
I won't have far to look.

570
00:46:02,444 --> 00:46:05,389
Don't know if I oughta interest myself
in a gal that can shoot like that.

571
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:08,110
Likely spend my life
picking buckshot outta my hide.

572
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:11,585
Some folks are gonna hold you to blame
for lettin' that jumper get away.

573
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,586
Oh, the jumpers didn't get Blake...
- Shh. Dusty.

574
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:16,985
What's goin' on around here?
You sat out there and saw 'em do it.

575
00:46:17,085 --> 00:46:19,710
That's what comes of lettin' a gal in on a secret.
- Yeah.

576
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,706
She held it longer
than most of'em would.

577
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:23,626
What are you two
talkin' about?

578
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:27,590
Dusty's right. The jumpers didn't rescue
Blake. The Kid and I have him at the ranch.

579
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:29,948
Well, you picked yourself
a right smart young deputy.

580
00:46:30,047 --> 00:46:32,909
That's what I been tryin' to tell him.
- Well, I'll be...

581
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:35,986
Come on, Dusty.
See ya in the morning.

582
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:38,071
Goodnight. -
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

583
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,426
How does it feel to have yourself
a right smart young deputy?

584
00:46:43,526 --> 00:46:45,947
I'll let you know
as soon as I get one.

585
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:47,996
Come on, Kid.
Let's clean this mess up.

586
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,831
Here comes
the boss now.

587
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,427
<i>You boys all right?
- Sure. All but Slim here.</i>

588
00:47:07,526 --> 00:47:09,984
<i>He'll be ridin'standin'up for a while.
- Where's Blake?</i>

589
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:12,949
That's what we'd like to know.
We bust in this jail, it's empty.

590
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:15,867
Empty? But Lightning
put him in jail.

591
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,989
<i>Lightning said he put him in jail.
- Well, then, where is Blake?</i>

592
00:47:19,088 --> 00:47:22,072
Hidden somewhere else.
You boys get back to the hideout.

593
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,265
You know something?

594
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:30,426
I have a feeling Lightning would do
most anything for me...

595
00:47:30,526 --> 00:47:32,426
or my brother.

596
00:47:32,525 --> 00:47:35,549
What are you getting at?
- Maybe if we use a trick of our own...

597
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:37,705
we can get him
to turn Blake over to us.

598
00:47:37,805 --> 00:47:40,307
What sort of trick?

599
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:44,518
Drive me back to the house, and I'll
tell you about it... brother dear.

600
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,866
<i>I figured that
sometime during the night...</i>

601
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:50,946
<i>thejumpers might take
a notion to sneak back...</i>

602
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:53,829
<i>and try to force me to tell
where Blake was hidden...</i>

603
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,268
<i>so I wasn't taking
any chances.</i>

604
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:59,193
<i>I was going to be ready
for them when they came.</i>

605
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,548
Lightning, you've gotta help me.
Some masked men broke into the house.

606
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:46,785
They pistol-whipped Rod,
and then they kidnapped him.

607
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:49,307
They hurt you?
- Recognize any of'em, Miss Lacey?

608
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,748
If you were listening, you
heard her say they were masked.

609
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,709
They had hands, didn't they?
Rings? Fancy boots?

610
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:56,786
<i>Maybe a black sombrero?</i>

611
00:48:56,885 --> 00:49:00,548
I'll take you home and look around, see
if the kidnappers left any trademarks.

612
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:03,074
You stay here in case
the jumpers come back.

613
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,151
The lamp is on the table.

614
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,945
I'd like to look over
Rod's room first.

615
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:46,951
It's through here.

616
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,669
Rod must've put up quite a fight.
- He did, but there were five of them.

617
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,748
Any idea why they wanted
to grab him?

618
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:03,746
He never had any trouble
that I know of.

619
00:50:03,846 --> 00:50:07,305
Maybe the jumpers are gonna try
to force Rod to sign over his claim.

620
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,668
But Rod hasn't filed
any claims here.

621
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:13,309
He was only interested in reopening
the old silver mine at Santa Rita.

622
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,147
You think they might've
grabbed him for ransom?

623
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,950
L... I don't know why they've
taken him, Lightning...

624
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:22,185
but I'm afraid for him.

625
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,191
I'm afraid.

626
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,315
Go ahead and cry if it
makes you feel any better.

627
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,145
Put your hands up.

628
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,435
You wouldn't shoot
your own deputy, would ya?

629
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,946
That was a smart stunt.
I almost plugged ya.

630
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:48,590
Maybe I shoulda. Might
teach ya to do as you're told.

631
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:51,187
I figured I'd
better tag along...

632
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:53,910
just in case you might need me
sorta accidental-like.

633
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,948
<i>From now on
I'll do the figuring.</i>

634
00:50:56,048 --> 00:50:59,505
As long as you're here, search these
downstairs rooms and the grounds outside...

635
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:01,506
and don't trample
on any signs.

636
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:03,556
You're the boss... boss.

637
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,991
We better check
your room.

638
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,990
What's in there?
- My dressing room.

639
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,025
Do you think you'll find Rod?
- I'll do everything I can, Brown Eyes.

640
00:51:56,124 --> 00:51:59,266
There's one fellow I'm gonna
check on as soon as I leave here.

641
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,468
Who's that?
- Johnny Sombrero.

642
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:05,989
But Johnny works for my brother. Why would
he want to kidnap him? It doesn't make sense.

643
00:52:06,088 --> 00:52:08,986
Sombrero does a lot of things
that don't make sense.

644
00:52:09,086 --> 00:52:11,305
Try to get some sleep,
Brown Eyes.

645
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:14,073
Goodnight, Lightning.
- Goodnight. See ya in the morning.

646
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,911
Kid.

647
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,466
<i>How dare you come into my room. You oughta be
horsewhipped. I came out and found him here.</i>

648
00:52:34,566 --> 00:52:38,148
I didn't know this filly was here. I heard
something, so I came to look around.

649
00:52:38,247 --> 00:52:40,151
Get out!

650
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,026
I've taken all I'm
gonna take from you.

651
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:49,628
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
You're not only blind, you're a cripple.

652
00:52:49,728 --> 00:52:52,626
<i>What do you mean "cripple"?
- Meaning you.</i>

653
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:57,228
I've noticed the way you been massaging that
right hand when you think no one's watching.

654
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:59,629
Go ahead. Let me see you
pull that trigger.

655
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,665
You're through.
Get out.

656
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,671
Go on. Get out!

657
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,951
Johnny Sombrero finds out about that, you won't
have the Indian sign on him any more, will ya?

658
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,387
He didn't take anything, did he?
- I don't know yet.

659
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:34,625
No. Here they are.

660
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:37,154
I'm sorry.

661
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,919
Thank you. They're fire opals.
They're my birthstone.

662
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,351
Please.
- Oh.

663
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,506
Aren't they exciting?

664
00:53:56,605 --> 00:53:58,628
Like their owner.

665
00:53:58,728 --> 00:54:02,838
I really haven't had much practice at this.
- I'd be very jealous if you had.

666
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,349
You again!
- I found this on the door as I was leavin'.

667
00:54:13,448 --> 00:54:15,829
I thought you might
be interested.

668
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,547
Is it about Rod?
- "Marshal, if you want Rod Lacey back alive...

669
00:54:21,646 --> 00:54:23,546
"you and Blake
start for hideout.

670
00:54:23,645 --> 00:54:28,505
"He knows where. On the way,
you'll be met and prisoners exchanged.

671
00:54:28,604 --> 00:54:32,470
Just you and Blake. No tricks,
or Lacey gets it. The Jumpers. "

672
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,110
That's not possible. Rod
told me they'd rescued Blake.

673
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,070
I've got Blake hidden away safe. I'm holding
him 'til he tells who killed Dan Musick.

674
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:41,465
But, Lightning,
they'll kill Rod.

675
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:44,154
Maybe I can get Rod
and still keep Rat Face.

676
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,676
Well... goodnight,
Brown Eyes.

677
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,825
<i>There was one more thing I had
to do before making my plans.</i>

678
00:55:03,924 --> 00:55:07,305
<i>I wanted to find out
ifJohnny Sombrero was in town.</i>

679
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:09,306
<i>Rat Face had been
his friend...</i>

680
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:12,517
<i>and he could be using Rod
to make me turn Rat Face free.</i>

681
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,271
Hands off that gun,
Johnny.

682
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,029
How long you been in bed?
- Since right after you let Blake escape.

683
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,984
Well. Wiped nice
and clean, huh?

684
00:55:42,084 --> 00:55:44,710
You take real good care of'em, don't you, Johnny?
- Always.

685
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:47,387
They cost me plenty in Santa Fe.
- Where's Rod Lacey?

686
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:50,466
In bed, I guess, where you oughta be.
- He was kidnapped an hour ago.

687
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:53,190
Mr Lacey?
- Five men broke into his house and grabbed him.

688
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:55,585
And you think I had
a hand in it? You're crazy.

689
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:57,905
I work for Mr Lacey.
He's a friend of mine.

690
00:55:58,005 --> 00:56:02,109
So was Rat Face. Maybe this is
your way of getting Rat Face back.

691
00:56:02,209 --> 00:56:05,389
Even swap; Rat Face for Rod.
That your idea, Johnny?

692
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,386
You're scratching
in the wrong place.

693
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:10,790
The only way to turn up worms
is by scratching for 'em.

694
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,665
<i>If he was the one who put that note
on the door of the Lacey house...</i>

695
00:56:21,765 --> 00:56:23,671
<i>his horse would
still feel sweated.</i>

696
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:30,064
<i>He was cool. I could tell
he hadn't been run for hours.</i>

697
00:56:30,164 --> 00:56:34,073
<i>I began to think I was all wrong about
Johnny Sombrero being mixed up in this.</i>

698
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,230
Made this batch
a mite stronger.

699
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:47,436
Well, the stronger,
the better.

700
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,027
Phew! Smells like
a skunk moved in.

701
00:56:57,126 --> 00:56:59,026
Garlic water.
- Garlic water?

702
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,026
Yeah, a trick I learned
from Dan Musick.

703
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,670
Rat Face gonna ride this horse
when Lightning takes him to the jumpers.

704
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:06,949
I trade Rat Face for Lacey.
Then the posse turns some dogs loose...

705
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,988
and they follow the trail
to Rat Face and the jumpers.

706
00:57:09,088 --> 00:57:11,790
That way he figures to
get 'em all. Kinda smart, huh?

707
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:14,148
No, I don't think it's smart.
I think it's crazy.

708
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:17,668
The posse gets the jumpers, but you and
the Silver Kid get bellies full of lead.

709
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,709
You can stop worrying about the Silver Kid. He's not going.
- Why not?

710
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:23,547
I told him he was through.
He kept buckin' me at every turn.

711
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:26,786
The Kid's fixin'
to leave town, Dusty.

712
00:57:26,885 --> 00:57:28,791
He's gettin'
his stuff together now.

713
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,550
Got a message for you,
Lightnin'... from Johnny Sombrero.

714
00:57:40,649 --> 00:57:43,154
He's waitin' for you
at the Blue Goose.

715
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,468
Johnny drunk?

716
00:57:46,568 --> 00:57:50,510
He's just been listenin'. He's
heard you been ridin' bluff on him.

717
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:53,064
That jumper's bullet did
things to your shootin' hand.

718
00:57:53,164 --> 00:57:57,668
Oh, you can still draw plenty fast,
but, uh, can't squeeze the trigger.

719
00:57:57,768 --> 00:57:59,948
Johnny aims to find out
whether he's been hearin' right.

720
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:02,467
Tell Johnny
I'll accommodate him.

721
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:04,471
It's a pleasure.

722
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,186
I, uh...

723
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,628
I heard you was leavin'.
- Well, you heard right.

724
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:23,025
There's nothin' left around here for me anyway.
- But you can't go now.

725
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,788
Why not?
- 'Cause Lightning's gone out to meet the jumpers alone.

726
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:30,947
What do you want me to do?
- You've gotta try and stop him.

727
00:58:31,046 --> 00:58:32,946
Look, Dusty...

728
00:58:33,045 --> 00:58:35,026
there's one thing
you oughta get straight.

729
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,148
Lightning's not
doing this for Dan Musick.

730
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,268
He's not doin' it
for Rod Lacey either.

731
00:58:39,368 --> 00:58:43,469
He's doin' it for Brown Eyes. If he wants
to stick his neck out for her, let him.

732
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:48,388
Me, I don't figure to stop no bullet
'cause he's stuck on that fancy filly.

733
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:51,908
Maybe what you say is right.
He is doing it for that Lacey woman.

734
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:54,869
But you can't let him go alone.
He's sure to get killed.

735
00:58:54,969 --> 00:58:58,228
That's too bad.
That's too bad for you.

736
00:58:58,328 --> 00:59:00,588
But I warned you
to get out of the game.

737
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:03,347
I'm not
in the game any more.

738
00:59:03,446 --> 00:59:06,150
You were right.

739
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:08,196
I just hope
it isn't too late.

740
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,984
You just couldn't wait to get even with
me, could ya? Why, you cheap little...

741
00:59:16,084 --> 00:59:18,385
In just about one second
I'm gonna forget you're crippled.

742
00:59:18,484 --> 00:59:21,589
Why didn't you forget it last night instead
of blabbing it to Johnny Sombrero?

743
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:24,746
I didn't say anything to anyone about your crippled hand.
- You're a liar.

744
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:27,709
Johnny sent Tinhorn around
to say he's waitin' for me.

745
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:29,786
Don't!

746
00:59:29,885 --> 00:59:32,348
Now get outta town,
and keep travelling!

747
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,345
You're not gonna meet Johnny, are ya?
- I got no choice.

748
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:45,948
If I back down, I might as well turn in
my badge and get out of Silver City.

749
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,106
But if your hand's no good,
Johnny'll kill you.

750
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:52,468
I always had the
Indian sign on Johnny.

751
00:59:52,568 --> 00:59:55,429
I think maybe I still got it.
Maybe when he sees me call his bluff...

752
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:58,825
he'll figure the Kid deliberately gave him
a bum steer just to frame him.

753
00:59:58,925 --> 01:00:01,869
If that happens, he'll
turn tail like he always did.

754
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:03,829
But what if he don't
turn tail?

755
01:00:03,928 --> 01:00:05,831
It's a chance
I gotta take.

756
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,751
Here he comes.

757
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,789
I'm takin' over
for Lightnin'.

758
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,673
Now you'll live
to get back to Brown Eyes.

759
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,108
Who killed Dan Musick?

760
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,148
Opal. She... wanted it.

761
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:49,870
Talk sense, Johnny.
I haven't much time.

762
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:52,909
The... The nugget.

763
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:57,915
Take a look in her jewel box
if you don't believe me.

764
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,749
You liar.
You dirty liar!

765
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:05,225
Who do you think told me
you couldn't squeeze a trigger?

766
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:10,075
Opal's been my gal
right... right along.

767
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,148
Hurt bad, Lightnin'?
- Darndest thing I ever saw. Shot by his own deputy.

768
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:24,067
Here, lemme tie this
around it.

769
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:28,466
I'm sorry I had you wrong, Kid.
- You didn't guess right on Brown Eyes either.

770
01:02:28,566 --> 01:02:31,270
Better let the doc
have a look at it.

771
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:34,830
The doc'll have to wait. I've
got somethin' to attend to first.

772
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,711
Darling, you've been hurt...

773
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,268
Lightning,
what are you doing?

774
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,545
How did this get in here?

775
01:03:08,645 --> 01:03:10,988
It was Johnny Sombrero's.
He gave it to me as a gift.

776
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,066
A gift of his
love for you...

777
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,790
to prove he'd do anything you want,
even if it meant shooting Dan Musick.

778
01:03:15,889 --> 01:03:18,989
What are you talking about?
- You can stop playing me for a fool now, Brown Eyes.

779
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:21,869
Please, Lightning, you must believe me.
I didn't know it was Musick's.

780
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:24,590
How could I? Johnny didn't say
where it came from. He only said...

781
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:28,108
Stop it. Johnny Sombrero is dead,
but he did a little talking first.

782
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:31,309
Johnny dead?
- I'm clumsy with necklaces. I can't squeeze the trigger.

783
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,428
You wanted him to kill me,
didn't you? Didn't you?

784
01:03:33,528 --> 01:03:35,905
No, I didn't!
- Who ordered Sombrero to kill me?

785
01:03:36,004 --> 01:03:38,108
Was it you
or your brother?

786
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:40,388
Rod... but he
isn't my brother.

787
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:44,749
He gave me the things I had to have,
the things I wanted... money and clothes.

788
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:47,667
When he wanted to control
a man, I managed it for him.

789
01:03:47,766 --> 01:03:50,187
So that's it, huh?
You and Rod are jumpers.

790
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:53,948
That's putting it a little coarsely. Let's
just say we buy up the jumpers' claims.

791
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:56,308
<i>But Rod's through. I don't
have to take his orders any more.</i>

792
01:03:56,407 --> 01:03:59,945
I never did like him anyway,
and you've been wanting me, darling.

793
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,270
The trading post
is closed, Brown Eyes.

794
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,307
Lightning, Dusty lit off
to deliver Rat Face.

795
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:09,705
The little fool. They'll kill her!
How long ago she leave?

796
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,748
About 20 minutes ago.
We'll never catch her.

797
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,826
I know a short cut
to the jumpers' hideout.

798
01:04:13,925 --> 01:04:15,549
<i>Where is it?
- Near Silver Creek.</i>

799
01:04:15,649 --> 01:04:19,185
But you better open that trading post,
'cause you'll never find it without me.

800
01:04:19,284 --> 01:04:21,388
I bet I can get it out of her.
- Stay away from me!

801
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:24,358
Wait a minute. Take us to
that hideout, we'll let you go.

802
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,708
All right, it's a deal.
- Round up some men.

803
01:04:29,808 --> 01:04:32,189
And remember, Brown Eyes,
this time, no tricks.

804
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,230
Shoulda caught up with Dusty by now.
- Unless she's already there.

805
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,350
It's Blake! And a
gal's brought him in.

806
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,311
Hey, Lacey!

807
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,908
<i>Hiya, Dusty.
- Mr Lacey.</i>

808
01:05:50,007 --> 01:05:53,588
<i>I'm so glad you're not hurt.
I brought Blake in exchange for you.</i>

809
01:05:53,687 --> 01:05:55,745
Gimme a hand.
- I appreciate that, Dusty.

810
01:05:55,845 --> 01:05:57,948
I sorta like it here.
I think I'll hang around awhile.

811
01:05:58,048 --> 01:05:59,946
How 'bout gettin'
these irons off of me, boss?

812
01:06:00,045 --> 01:06:01,866
Boss?

813
01:06:01,965 --> 01:06:04,105
That's right, Dusty.

814
01:06:04,205 --> 01:06:06,707
I'm much obliged to ya
for bringing Blake back.

815
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:09,633
<i>I'd have liked it better
if Lightning had come along though.</i>

816
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,466
Posse comin'!

817
01:06:31,565 --> 01:06:34,393
Get her inside.
Keep her there. Quick!

818
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,910
Their hideout is on the
other side of those rocks.

819
01:06:55,009 --> 01:06:58,588
This is as far as I go.
- Just a minute. You're gonna take us in there.

820
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,666
No, I made a deal. Let her go.
- How do we know she ain't lyin'?

821
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:05,469
If she is, I'll find her and bring her back.
Get goin', Brown Eyes.

822
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,948
Little double-crosser.

823
01:07:12,048 --> 01:07:15,237
She's bringing 'em in here.
Keep down 'til you hear me fire.

824
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,832
Bob, take two men up there. Jack,
three men up high. Rest of you, scatter!

825
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,789
Now remember,
don't shoot 'til I shoot.

826
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,267
Opal!

827
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:44,187
Rod! There's
a posse coming.

828
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,788
<i>Yeah... and you
brought 'em.</i>

829
01:08:47,887 --> 01:08:51,873
<i>But I came to warn you.
No, Rod, don't! I love you!</i>

830
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,993
We're trapped!
Spread out!

831
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,757
Hey! There's
Dusty's horse!

832
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,830
Come on. Get on up
to that trough there!

833
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,389
Here they are, Marshal.

834
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:32,074
Where's the Kid and Dusty?
- In there.

835
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,831
Excuse me.

836
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,031
Come here.

837
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,867
I just thought...
What is your name?

838
01:12:49,967 --> 01:12:53,069
I can't go through life
being called Mrs Silver Kid.

839
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,146
Luke Cromwell.
- Hello, Luke.

840
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:59,869
Hold on. How 'bout you? Dusty ain't no dignified name...
- It's Jane.

841
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,431
Hi, Jane.

842
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,586
You again.

843
01:13:12,685 --> 01:13:15,797
We're set to pull out, Kid.
So any time you're ready.

844
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,670
