And a lovely day it is,
sir. Colder than blazes.

There's a despatch rider
from Paradise River patrol -

27
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,188
Private McKenzie's been shot.

28
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,603
A boy or a girl?

29
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,826
(COUGHS) It's a little trooper, sir.

00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,897
When does the stagecoach stop?

31
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,890
It's finished. No
more stagecoach, sir.

McKenzie
- is he dead?

33
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,605
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:47,058
Oh. Good man, McKenzie.

35
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,777
Would have made corporal
in five or six years.

00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:02,019
(SNIFFS) Your breath
smells like a hot mince pie.

37

Oh, Captain, darlin', I took
the pledge after Chepota -

38
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,734
And Bull Run, Gettysburg, and Shiloh.

39
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:11,034

Beats me why you hide the stuff.

Six more days.

42
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,302
Six more days and I retire.

43
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:30,790
The army won't be the
same when we retire, sir.

44
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,401
It's always the same.

45
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:36,083
The sun and the moon change,
the army knows no seasons.

46
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,770
We're in our prime and
they're retiring us.

47
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:41,378
It's an abuse of the
tax-payers' money.

48
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,102
And you've only ever
paid whisky tax. Ready?

49
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:46,173
Ready, sir!

50
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:54,957
Morning, gentlemen.

51
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,991
BOTH: Good morning, sir!

52
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:06,160
Well... carry on.

53
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,067
Good morning, Mr Allen!

54
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:23,844
Ho!

55
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:32,398

56
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:34,662
Inspection.

57
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,569
That's Tyree and the
Paradise River patrol.

58
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,219
Ya.

59
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:14,059
- Report, Sergeant.
- I found him dead of a gunshot wound.

60
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:16,936
- Where?
- Near Red Butte, sir.

61
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:21,693
Horses are about to give in, sir.

62
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,301
Money box is gone, sir.

63
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:37,959
Cheadle?

64
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:41,603
What do you make of the wound, Doctor?

65
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,130
I'll need an hour, Major.
Fetch him to hospital.

66
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,238
- It's not Kiowa.
- No.

67
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,845
Nor Comanche nor Arapaho.
Not with those colours.

68
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,108
(CLEARS THROAT) Sir?

69
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,947
OK, put in your two cents worth.

70
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,893
Sir, these yellow, white and red arrows
are the sign of the Southern Cheyenne.

71
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,924
Bannocks and Snakes
use the same colours.

72
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:25,144
That's very true, sir. But look
at the clan mark on this arrow.

73
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,599
It's the sign of the dog.

74
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:31,013
It's from the bow of a
Southern Cheyenne dog soldier.

75
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:34,810
What would the Cheyenne
be doing this far south?

76
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:37,457
That's isn't my department, sir.

77
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:40,066
- Alert the post, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir!

78
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:42,712
- Get some rest, Tyree.
- Thank you, sir.

BUGLE CALL

80
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:04,503
Just a moment, Mr
Pennell, if you please.

81
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:10,027
Lieutenant, the post is
closed. Sorry, Miss Dandridge.

82
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,791
Sorry!

83
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:16,855
Mr Cohill, haven't you anything better
to do than run around being obnoxious?

84
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:20,000
If you have any
complaints about my orders,

85
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,877
submit them in writing
to Major Allshard.

86
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:24,834
Duplicate or triplicate?

87
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,249
- Don't be a spoilsport.
- That's what he is.

88
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:32,237
Just because I wouldn't go on
a picnic with you last Sunday.

89
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:33,733
Drive on, Ross!

90
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:36,151
- I'll arrest you.
- You wouldn't dare.

91
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:38,298
Someone arresting you, Miss Dandridge?

92
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:41,253
Lieutenant Cohill is ordering me -

93
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:45,050
- Sir, I was - - You're
at attention, Mr Cohill.

94
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,470
Proceed.

95
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:51,035
I don't wanna make a scene, Captain. I'm
sure that Mr Cohill is a fine officer.

96
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:53,721
I know his father, General Cohill.

97
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:58,553
But Lieutenant Cohill thinks Lieutenant
Pennell hasn't rank enough for me.

98
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:02,122
- If I could explain - -
You're at attention, Mr Pennell.

99
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:05,036
Do you wish to further
amplify your complaint?

100
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,221
Complaint? Oh, I'm not complaining.

101
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,210
Why, I love Fort Starke, and I
simply adore the entire cavalry!

102
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:15,164
- Our pleasure, ma'am.
- Yes, indeed.

103
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:20,574
Mr Cohill, wipe that grin off
your face. You have the floor.

104
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:24,525
Sir, I have denied Mr Pennell
permission to leave the post.

105
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:28,514
And for what purpose did
you wish to leave the post?

106
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:31,698
- Picnicking, sir.
- Picnicking?

107
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:36,263
Picnicking, Miss Dandridge?
Where? In St. Louis?

108
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,411
No, by the waterfall. I'm sorry -

109
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,788
Never apologise, mister,
it's a sign of weakness.

110
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:46,890
Mr Cohill, I see no reason why Mr
Pennell should not go picnicking.

111
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,191
Very good, sir.

112
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,449
Thank you, Captain Brittles.

113
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:57,592
But, Miss Dandridge, Mr Cohill
was right to stop you going out,

114
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:59,855
under the present emergency.

115
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:02,694
So, may I escort you to your quarters?

116
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:07,489
You may proceed with
your picnic, Mr Pennell.

117
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,637
You may pass Lieutenant
Pennell, Sergeant.

118
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,747
Pass Lieutenant Pennell!

119
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,973
Pass Lieutenant Pennell!

120
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,310
Where are you having your picnic?

121
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:21,913
I'll tell you - New York, in about two
months, with Olivia on my arm.

122
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,675
And I won't be wearing any blue suit!

123
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,095
Ya!

124
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:32,539
REVEILLE

125
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:49,112
Here's the last report
on George Custer's outfit.

126
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,220
212 dead on the Little Big Horn.

127
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,863
Headquarters expects
hard and bloody winter.

128
00:11:55,941 --> 00:12:01,119
Sitting Bull preaching holy war.
Take all necessary precautions.

129
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:06,835
Here's the list. I expect
you knew most of them.

130
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,781
George Armstrong Custer...

131
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,852
Tom Custer...

132
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:16,848
Austin Custer...

133
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:19,495
Calhoun...

134
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,258
Carp...

135
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:23,331
Crittenden...

136
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,556
Harrington...

137
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:27,742
Keogh...

138
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:29,814
Miles Keogh?

139
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, Mary, only six more days to go,

140
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:20,297
and your old Nathan
will be out of the army.

141
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,669
I haven't decided what I'll do yet.

142
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:32,841
Somehow I just can't picture myself
back there on the banks of the Wabash,

143
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,105
rocking on the front porch.

144
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:40,398
Well, I've been thinking
I'll maybe push on west.

145
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,542
New settlements. California.

146
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:49,682
We had some sad news today, Mary.

147
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,251
George Custer was killed
and his whole command.

148
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:57,394
Miles Keogh among them.
You remember Miles.

149
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:00,155
Happy-go-lucky
Irishman...

150
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,800
who used to waltz so well with you.

151
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:08,365
Yeah, I know, I guess
I was a little jealous.

152
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:11,970
Never could waltz, myself.

153
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:18,146
Well, I'll take a trip out in the morning
- Cheyennes are around.

154
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:23,633
I'm gonna pick up the patrols
and drive them back north.

155
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,546
Probably be my last mission, Mary.

156
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,499
Hard to believe, isn't it?

157
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:34,604
Hard to believe.

158
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,112
I hope I'm not intruding, Captain,

159
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:05,831
but I've watched you come
out here to your family and...

160
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,749
So, I...

161
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,974
So, I brought you this.

162
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,546
Well...

163
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,847
I appreciate this very much.

164
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:18,221
It's called Cyclamen. It's a Greek
word. It means 'rabbit's ears.'

165
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:23,861
My wife called them Flaming Arrows.
She was... she was fond of gardening.

166
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:29,577
I'm sorry I made such a fool of
myself at the gate this morning.

167
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,223
You made a fool out of
two young lieutenants.

168
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,448
That's never against the rules.

169
00:15:34,563 --> 00:15:37,747
- Then I'm forgiven?
- Ah! Forgiven!

170
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:41,737
Well, goodnight, Captain.

171
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:46,493
Goodnight, miss. Thank you.

172
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:01,110
She's a nice girl.

173
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:04,984
Reminds me of you.

174
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,516
REVEILLE

175
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,608
- Time, sir!
- Alright.

176
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:24,203
Well, old comrade, last patrol, eh?

177
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,352
Aye, the last of many, sir.

178
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,728
- Five more.
- Three more.

179
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:31,223
- Five more!
- Three more!

180
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:35,174
- Five! Can't you count?
- Three weeks before I retire, sir.

181
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:40,429
Oh. Days, weeks, what's the difference?
Are you going to stand there all morning?

182
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:42,310
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologise...

183
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:44,611
BOTH: It's a sign of weakness.

184
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:46,682
- Ready?
- Ready, sir!

185
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,854
- Good morning.
- Morning

186
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:56,733
- Hochbauer.
- Good morning, sir.

187
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:59,265
- Once again we ride, eh?
- Yes, sir.

188
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:01,797
Morning, men.

189
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:13,766
- What's this? Hochbauer?
- Yes, sir?

190
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:16,720
- What's this?
- By order of Major Allshard, sir.

191
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:20,902
- There's no wagon goes on this patrol.
- Orders, sir.

192
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,121
- Orders, huh?
- Yes, sir.

193
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:26,541
Huh.

194
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:30,953
Morning, sir.

195
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,321
- Side-saddle,
Riley? - Yes, sir.

196
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:38,701
Ya!

197
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:44,418
Side-saddle! Major
Allshard, what in blazes -

198
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,527
Hold it! I know
- the wagon.

199
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:49,328
Yes, a wagon full of women's junk.

200
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:52,933
I can't hamper this
patrol with a wagon.

201
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:58,151
I'm sending my wife and her niece
with you, as far as Sudrow's Wells,

202
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,992
where they'll take the stage.

203
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:03,137
- That is an order, Captain.
- I protest.

204
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:06,858
- I expected you to. Put it in writing.
- I intend to.

205
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:09,735
I sat up half the night with this.

206
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:14,684
I can't keep the Dandridge girl here
- she ain't army.

207
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,756
Yes, for these reasons...

208
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:19,095
- Coffee?
- One... No. Yes!

209
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:25,080
There's a party of Cheyenne dog
soldiers raiding this territory.

210
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,499
I think -

211
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:29,569
- How many Rs in territory?
- Two.

212
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,914
Men, I want you to pay strict
attention to what I say.

213
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:49,019
There's gonna be
women with this column,

214
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,857
and I want you men
to watch them words.

215
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,237
Watch them words!

216
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,309
Watch them grammar!

217
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,122
Whose dog is this?

218
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,884
Whose dog is this?

219
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,987
Nice dog. Irish setter.

220
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,049
Poor Abby says everyone will
think she's running away.

221
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,848
It's gonna be tough on me
- I'll be a bachelor all winter.

222
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:30,755
And in conclusion, I respectfully protest
the decision of my commanding officer,

223
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:36,472
to saddle this troop with
his female relations...

224
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:39,502
- One L.
- In this critical hour.

225
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:44,066
Signed Nathan
Brittles... and so forth.

226
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:47,597
Sounds very good, Nathan.
Give it to me, I'll file it.

227
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,590
- Hochbauer!
- Yes, sir.

228
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:53,695
I know this is a hard decision
for you. Gonna miss Abby.

229
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:57,456
I hate to hamstring you,
but you will be careful?

230
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,374
- Mac!
- Oh, forget it.

231
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:03,478
As you were, Hochbauer.
Well, here I am, all ready.

232
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:07,812
How did Nathan take the idea
of old iron-pants riding along?

233
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,956
- Under protest, my dear.
- Written protest, Abby, of course.

234
00:20:12,032 --> 00:20:15,792
It's always my pleasure
to escort old iron-pants.

235
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:18,362
Well, as long as you're going -

236
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:23,350
That is the damn blastedest outfit
ever! Quincannon's old breeches.

237
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:25,075
Yes.

238
00:20:29,948 --> 00:20:33,324
- Morning, Mr Cohill.
- Morning.

239
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:37,542
- I hope you approve of my uniform.
- Yes, indeed.

240
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,458
It's very lovely, Olivia.

241
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:45,906
So, Ross has branded you
with his yellow ribbon?

242
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,589
How do you know it
isn't for you, mister?

243
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:55,382
I'd be very happy if I thought
it were for me. Very happy indeed.

244
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:59,140
- Good morning!
- Trooper Dandridge reporting, sir.

245
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,820
Well, a proper trooper! Right
pretty, don't you think, Mr Cohill?

246
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,239
Yes, sir.

247
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:08,462
A yellow ribbon. Do you know
what that means in the cavalry?

248
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,649
- A sweetheart.
- It does?

249
00:21:10,726 --> 00:21:14,562
- Who's it for?
- For you of course, Captain Brittles.

250
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:17,861
For me! I'll make these
young bucks jealous.

251
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:24,268
Good morning, Flint.

252
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:28,256
You look nice. I hope Ross
notices that yellow ribbon.

253
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:40,341
I hope you're wearing
that yellow ribbon for me.

254
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:43,219
Who else would I be wearing it for?

255
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:23,575
Right, by twos.

256
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,033
Yo!

257
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:26,951
MUSIC: Round her neck

258
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,060
She wore a yellow ribbon

259
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:30,518
She wore it in the winter

260
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:33,011
And the merry month of May

261
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,814
When I asked her

262
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,502
'Why the yellow ribbon?"

263
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:37,961
She said, "It's for my lover

264
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:39,917
who is in the cavalry."

265
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,872
Cavalry!

266
00:22:41,988 --> 00:22:44,060
Cavalry!

267
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,671
She said, "It's for my lover,

268
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,551
who is in the cavalry."

269
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:49,469
Cavalry!

270
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,425
Cavalry!

271
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,229
She said, "It's for my lover,

272
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:55,414
in the US cavalry." END

273
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:18,851
Report.

274
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:21,805
I trailed Mr Rynders buckboard, sir.

275
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:26,370
About a mile below the painted
pole, he met two men in a wagon.

276
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:30,934
- Do you know who they were?
- No, it didn't seem prudent to inquire.

277
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,425
Why do you think they're so far south?

278
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:37,725
Well, that ain't my department.

279
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:40,218
We'll probably pick them
up on the next go round.

280
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,443
- Take the point.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:24,909
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir?

282
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,595
Ride through that pass.

283
00:25:45,856 --> 00:25:48,464
Romantic, isn't it, Miss Dandridge?

284
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:50,420
Guidons gaily fluttering,

285
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:52,761
bronzed men lustily singing,

286
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,717
horses prancing,

287
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:56,405
bunions aching.

288
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:59,589
Must you always be
so vulgar, Mr Cohill?

289
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,967
The cavalry doesn't
go in for refinements.

290
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:07,185
Cavalry! Silly business of dismounting
and walking every hour or so.

291
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,980
- It's like being in the infantry.
- We would be, if tired out our mounts.

292
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:14,473
You could ride in the wagon.

293
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:16,967
Army wagons don't have springs.

294
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,652
The men would rather
have finger bowls.

295
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:21,953
I think that's terribly
funny, Mr Cohill -

296
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:23,756
...greens and milk.

297
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,559
Oh, the army!

298
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:29,972
I planted 24 gardens, the
first 10 years of our marriage.

299
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:33,654
We never stayed long enough
to see a single bloom.

300
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:38,870
Could I ride back along the line? I'd
rather share the dust with Mr Pennell.

301
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:42,439
You've already thrown
enough dust in his eyes!

302
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:46,543
Mr Cohill, relieve Mr
Pennell of the rear guard.

303
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:48,423
Yes, Sir!

304
00:26:57,706 --> 00:26:59,586
Are you enjoying your walk, darlin'?

305
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,809
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

306
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:14,739
Yo!

307
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:18,575
Hold!

308
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:43,549
Can you make em out?
They look like Arapaho.

309
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:47,346
They're moving the whole village
- wagons, lodges, and all.

310
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:13,625
Well...

311
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,302
I don't know where you got your brains,
but God must have given you those eyes.

312
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:23,368
They're Arapahos alright
- heading the same way we are.

313
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:34,914
Now, why would they be moving on
Sudrow's Wells? Answer me that.

314
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:40,285
My mother didn't raise her sons to make
guesses in front of yankee captains.

315
00:28:41,282 --> 00:28:44,121
Well, I'd soon find out if...

316
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:46,998
Oh, I can't risk it with those women.

317
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:48,955
- Officers' call.
- Yes, sir.

318
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,041
- Are those hostile indians?
- Rejoin the column.

319
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:18,878
- Captain Brittles!
- Get back in line.

320
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,010
I don't like it, Mr Cohill,
I don't like it at all.

321
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,430
Arapahos?

322
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:31,267
We're giving them a wide berth.

323
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:35,143
- Go through Twin Forks.
- But we'll lose half a day!

324
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,137
The ladies may miss the stage.

325
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:39,861
Would you rather they
missed their scalps?

326
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:42,470
- Take the column, Mr Cohill.
- Yes, Sir.

327
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:44,349
- I'm sorry -
- Oh, shut up!

328
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:16,420
You're relieved, Mr
Cohill. I'm taking over.

329
00:30:16,535 --> 00:30:20,103
The old man hasn't spoken
to me in three hours.

330
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,404
The ladies may miss the stage.

331
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:25,703
You'll be lucky if he
talks to you in three days.

332
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:28,389
- It'll be his last chance to.
- Yeah?

333
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,691
So, you're still going to resign?

334
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:33,529
- Through channels.
- As adjudant, I'll tear it up!

335
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:38,785
Every second lieutenant can resign three
times during his first tour of duty.

336
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:42,083
You forget I don't have
to depend on cavalry pay.

337
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,268
That's right, I had
forgotten your silver spoon.

338
00:30:45,383 --> 00:30:48,604
But I bet Miss Olivia
Dandridge hasn't!

339
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,176
Do you want to pull your blouse?

340
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:54,053
Hold your coat, Lieutenant Pennell.

341
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:02,606
Why don't you let Ross Pennell
go? He could be a fine officer.

342
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:06,405
- You're not his guardian -
nor am I. - I'll say it anyway.

343
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:09,780
Ross is a spoilt, rich kid.
The army's his only hope.

344
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:12,197
So, if you can't take it, let him be!

345
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:50,598
Buffalo!

346
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:54,242
- Buffalo, Mr Cohill.
- Yes, sir.

347
00:31:55,201 --> 00:32:00,303
First time the herd's been this
far north since... summer of '68.

348
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:04,638
- You never saw a buffalo, Mr Pennell?
- No, sir.

349
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:06,211
Oh.

350
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:08,320
Before your time.

351
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,121
Sergeant, Quincannon!

352
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:14,113
Escort the ladies forward, please.

353
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,366
Aunt Abbey, that's really buffalo!

354
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:37,284
Yes, buffalo.

355
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,738
Aye, that's a lot of buffalo.

356
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:44,802
It reminds me of the old days
- when whisky was 50 cents a gallon.

357
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:49,981
- Sure hanker for some buffalo meat.
- I ain't never had none.

358
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:51,861
Beans is safer!

359
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:57,346
You mark my word, there'll be indians
around that herd thicker than flies.

360
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:02,219
What's your thinking? And don't
tell me it ain't your department.

361
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:07,166
Well, Captain, I ain't getting paid
for thinking. I read it this way.

362
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:10,542
If I was a young,
hot-blood, like Red Shirt,

363
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,839
anxious to show off in front
of them Cheyenne dog soldiers,

364
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,910
I'd be down at the counsel fire,

365
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:21,668
telling them I made the medicine
that brought back the buffalo.

366
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:25,081
I'd tell them about the Great Spirit.

367
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:30,069
How us Indians should all stick together
- quit quarrelling.

368
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:32,640
Join our Cheyenne brothers,

369
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:37,512
who took General Custer and drove
out the rest of the yankee soldiers.

370
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:39,621
That's what I'd tell 'em.

371
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,997
Of course, I'm just guessing, Captain.

372
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:44,569
Well...

373
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,906
Of course, I'm just
guessing too, Sergeant.

374
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:53,278
But if I was an indian
agent, maybe named Mr Rynders,

375
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:57,575
and I'd met a couple of men
who might be gun-runners,

376
00:33:57,613 --> 00:34:02,178
I'm guessing I'd be mighty close
to that counsel fire of Red Shirt's,

377
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:06,206
ready to do a land office
business in repeating rifles.

378
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:09,122
Well, why don't we take the whole -

379
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:11,844
Miss Dandridge and her chaperone.

380
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,489
Keep it up! That's all
I ask! Just keep it up!

381
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:21,090
Sergeant, make for the Paradise
River. Pick up our patrol there.

382
00:34:21,166 --> 00:34:24,927
Go to Sudrow's Wells and hold
the stagecoach for the ladies.

383
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,264
- Yes, sir!
- Tell them I've been delayed.

384
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:29,990
- Take the column, Mr Cohill.
- Yes, sir.

385
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:03,939
Ho-oh!

386
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:06,357
Ladies to the rear!

387
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:10,653
Mr Cohill?

388
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,226
Ya!

389
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:14,298
GUNSHOT

390
00:35:16,676 --> 00:35:18,671
GUNFIRE

391
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,847
First two sets of fours
- forward!

392
00:35:25,653 --> 00:35:27,647
Take the column, Mr Cohill.

393
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,987
GUNSHOT

394
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:45,217
GUNFIRE

395
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:54,692
GUNFIRE

396
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:06,316
It's Quayne's patrol.
Men, hold your fire!

397
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,523
Sound recall.

398
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,845
Yo!

399
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:33,169
Yo! Over here!

400
00:36:45,177 --> 00:36:47,707
Alright, Mike? Alright, my boy?

401
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:49,780
WHOOPING

402
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,578
Commence firing, men.

403
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,992
Shoot over their heads.

404
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,555
Help him up. Men?

405
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:37,924
Corporal Quayne, sir, reporting
with Paradise River patrol.

406
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:43,332
- Arapahos jumped us at sundown.
- It was Red Shirt himself, Captain!

407
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,823
Shut up, McCarthy! Quiet
while I'm making this report!

408
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:48,933
Easy, Mike, easy.

409
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:52,922
They had us ringed at night.

410
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,799
We got away.

411
00:37:56,452 --> 00:38:00,710
Made it to the relief point,
but you weren't there, Sir.

412
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:05,275
I wanted to be there,
Corporal. Proceed.

413
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:09,841
They flushed us at dawn, Sir,

414
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:11,720
and I got this.

415
00:38:14,406 --> 00:38:16,592
That's a good, clear report.

416
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,664
It'll show on your record.

417
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,425
You'll get that extra stripe.

418
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:23,151
Thank you, Sir.

419
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:25,224
Sound for the wagon.

420
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:27,908
Easy, fella.

421
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:33,432
Good work, McCarthy. Good work, men!

422
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,575
You'll get you some whisky,
Quayne. You'll be alright.

423
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,931
Halt!

424
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,729
- What's happened?
- Quayne's hurt.

425
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:21,192
Cheyennes, laddie.

426
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:26,104
Same ones that killed them yankee
soldiers with General Custer.

427
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:28,097
WHOOPING

428
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:52,417
Easy, boy. Let's go.

429
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:15,664
The arrow head's right over
Quayne's heart. It's got to come out.

430
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,580
It's a risky operation. Can you halt?

431
00:41:18,694 --> 00:41:20,651
You know I can't.

432
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:24,065
For 30 minutes, 20
minutes. For a man's life -

433
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:27,708
I couldn't give you five
minutes if it were my own son.

434
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,740
Quayne will have to
take a soldier's risks.

435
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:33,770
He knows that. I'm
the one who's begging.

436
00:41:33,886 --> 00:41:38,182
I'll give you all I can.
Troop halt! Dismount leads.

437
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:40,062
Thank you, Nathan.

438
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:42,401
Hold your cap in the ranks.

439
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,975
Heinrich, as slow as you can.

440
00:42:57,054 --> 00:42:59,240
Now, Mike, another slug.

441
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:01,925
After you, ma'am, if you please.

442
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:08,638
Down it goes.

443
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:10,710
THUNDER

444
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:15,276
(SINGS) For on her knee
She wore a yellow garter

445
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:18,613
She wore it for her lover
Who was far, far, away

446
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,761
Yes, we'll manage it, ma'am.

447
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,791
And when they asked her
Why she wore the garter

448
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:25,517
Breathe deep, Mikey.

449
00:43:25,595 --> 00:43:29,239
She wore it for her
lover In the US Calvalry

450
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,230
Cavalry!

451
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,917
Cavalry!

452
00:43:34,955 --> 00:43:36,681
Easy, my darling.

453
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,614
Captain Brittles! Captain Brittles!

454
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:49,225
Ya! Ya!

455
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,704
0'Laughlin?

456
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,583
Here it is. I had to -

457
00:43:59,622 --> 00:44:01,654
Not the details! How is he?

458
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:06,105
I think I can safely say,
he'll live to make sergeant.

459
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,175
Troop, halt!

460
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:13,200
Pass the word
- Quayne's doing fine.

461
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,888
CHEERING

462
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,998
Prepare to mount!

463
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:20,529
Mount!

464
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:25,784
Forward ho!

465
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:33,839
Thanks, soldier.

466
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:49,492
I'm so happy about Corporal Quayne.

467
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:53,826
Why? He's just another dog-faced
soldier in dirty shirt blue.

468
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,205
What do you care if he lives or dies?

469
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,344
Did you ever dance with him,
speak to him, or even look at him?

470
00:45:02,112 --> 00:45:06,294
No, of course you didn't. No
officer's bars, not a gentleman.

471
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,859
I've been finding that some lieutenant's
bars are no guarantee of a gentleman.

472
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:13,121
You're glad about Quayne,

473
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,764
because it's a story with a happy
ending to tell back east at a tea party.

474
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:20,680
Now you can tell them
you've seen it all:

475
00:45:20,755 --> 00:45:23,825
A real indian fight, a
man shot with an arrow -

476
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:27,008
- Mr Cohill!
- Your tour's just about perfect!

477
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:28,390
Uh...

478
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:32,418
Mrs Allshard's not well, Miss
Dandridge. Chloroform and all...

479
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,526
- Would you sit with her?
- Yes, Captain.

480
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,635
And thank you!

481
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:45,615
Mr Cohill, did anyone ever take
down your breeches and tan your hide?

482
00:45:45,729 --> 00:45:49,643
Why, no, Sir - that is - yes,
Sir. My father, Sir, with a strap.

483
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:53,786
Well, I'm old enough to be
your father. Take the point.

484
00:45:55,397 --> 00:45:58,121
They'll make a fine married couple.

485
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:01,841
Troop, ho!

486
00:46:01,994 --> 00:46:03,989
THUNDER

487
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,703
RIDER APPROACHING

488
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:33,605
Over there, Sir!

489
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:35,024
Hey, ya!

490
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:48,258
GUNFIRE

491
00:46:56,468 --> 00:46:58,194
Women to the rear!

492
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:03,910
- Doesn't Captain - - Oh, shut
your gob! You talk too much.

493
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,864
When he says, back to the rear, go!

494
00:47:06,979 --> 00:47:10,086
- I'll give you a kiss.
- You'd better go, Miss.

495
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:12,619
- Well, I'd hate to
be kissed - - Shut up!

496
00:47:13,386 --> 00:47:15,803
First two sets, forward.

497
00:47:15,995 --> 00:47:17,758
Guard...

498
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,140
Yo!

499
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,749
ALL: Ya! Ya!

WHOOPING

501
00:47:56,044 --> 00:48:00,033
- I'm glad to see you, Captain.
- Sorry to be late, Tyree. Report.

502
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,792
Cheyenne dog party
- about 30 Arapahos with them.

503
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:06,286
Well, that blows the lid, doesn't it?

504
00:48:28,383 --> 00:48:30,492
Ma and Pa Sudrow, Sir.

505
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:41,271
- Children see it?
- No, Sir.

506
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:44,148
Found them hiding in the smoke-house.

507
00:48:46,413 --> 00:48:48,407
Tyree...

508
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:51,974
It's about time I did retire.

509
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:53,625
Sir?

510
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,003
Would you take a
look at Trooper Smith?

511
00:49:06,897 --> 00:49:09,314
Don't bother about me, Captain.

512
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,038
I trust you'll forgive
my presumption -

513
00:49:12,153 --> 00:49:15,683
I commended the boy for the
way he handled this action,

514
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:19,250
in the best tradition
of the cavalry, Sir.

515
00:49:19,364 --> 00:49:21,513
I take that very kindly, Sir.

516
00:49:23,048 --> 00:49:25,005
Captain Tyree?

517
00:49:27,075 --> 00:49:28,686
Captain Tyree?

518
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,372
- Speak to him.
- Thank you.

519
00:49:31,488 --> 00:49:33,251
Yes, Sir?

520
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:35,094
Sir?

521
00:49:35,169 --> 00:49:36,935
Sir?

522
00:49:37,012 --> 00:49:39,312
I'm afraid he can't hear you...

523
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:41,807
Captain.

524
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:08,161
Poor things.

525
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,118
My Carrie-Sue.

526
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,991
Do you remember me? I'm Mrs Soldier.

527
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:19,210
You visited me at the fort and
we had a party. Do you remember?

528
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:22,547
See to your troop, Mr Cohill.

529
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:25,117
Mr Pennell
- picket lines.

530
00:50:26,115 --> 00:50:28,185
You don't have to say it, Captain.

531
00:50:28,646 --> 00:50:33,402
I know all this is because of me
- because I wanted to see the west.

532
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:37,776
Cos I wasn't... I wasn't army
enough to stay the winter.

533
00:50:39,924 --> 00:50:44,757
You're not army yet, but never
apologise, it's a sign of weakness.

534
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:47,214
Yes, but I'm to blame for it.

535
00:50:47,328 --> 00:50:50,243
Only the man who
commands can be blamed.

536
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:52,353
It rests on me.

537
00:50:53,581 --> 00:50:55,615
Mission failure.

538
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:07,583
Well, we missed the
stage, Miss Dandridge.

539
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:24,270
Well, that's the best I can do.

540
00:51:24,386 --> 00:51:27,302
I ran out of red flannel petticoats.

541
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:29,986
- You're mighty kind.
- Thank you.

542
00:51:30,024 --> 00:51:33,017
- We thank you kindly.
- I'm proud to do it.

543
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:42,147
I am the resurrection and
the life, sayeth the Lord.

544
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:46,596
He that believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live,

545
00:51:47,018 --> 00:51:50,624
and whoso shall believeth
in me, shall never die.

546
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:52,772
I know that my redeemer liveth,

547
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:57,454
and that he shall stand at
the latter day upon the earth.

548
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:02,363
I commend to your keeping, Sir,

549
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,354
the souls of John Sudrow,
and his wife, Martha.

550
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:11,916
I also commend to your
keeping the soul of Rome Clay,

551
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,598
late Brigadier General,
Confederate States Army.

552
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:18,206
Known to his comrades here, Sir,

553
00:52:18,284 --> 00:52:22,197
as trooper John Smith,
United States Cavalry.

554
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:25,648
A gallant soldier and
a Christian gentleman.

555
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,261
Ready...

556
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:29,254
Aim
- fire!

557
00:52:29,332 --> 00:52:31,441

558
00:52:31,557 --> 00:52:33,705
Aim
- fire!

559
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:35,815
Shoulder arms.

560
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:39,765
- With your permission, Sir.
- Granted.

561
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,334
- Bugler.
- We thank you, Sir.

562
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,444
LAST POST

563
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:11,260
I wouldn't go any
further if I were you.

564
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:15,826
You're almost across
the footlights now.

565
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:22,540
There may be a hundred
hostiles out there watching you.

Let's go back.

569
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,854
I'll walk myself, thank you.

571
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:52,422
The old man says don't ever
apologise, it's a sign of weakness.

572
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:54,609
But, I'm sorry,

573
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:57,486
for everything I've said and done.

574
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:04,161
I love you so -

575
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:08,035
- Right, let's get it over with.
- Are you crazy, mister?

576
00:54:08,113 --> 00:54:11,642
You've been jealous since
she put on that yellow ribbon.

577
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,329
Button up that shirt.

578
00:54:13,446 --> 00:54:16,667
Sneer all you like, but
keep your paws off my girl.

579
00:54:16,745 --> 00:54:19,045
Alright, I'll accommodate you.

580
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:21,654
- Ross, don't.
- I quite agree.

581
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:28,752
Mr Pennell. I thought better of you.

582
00:54:28,904 --> 00:54:30,900
Four years out here,

583
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:34,736
and still acting like a
wet-eared kid on the Hudson.

584
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,037
What is all this about, Mr Cohill?

585
00:54:37,114 --> 00:54:40,144
Sir, I decline to
answer... respectfully.

586
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,096
Mr Cohill,

587
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:46,397
it is a bitter thing indeed,

588
00:54:46,475 --> 00:54:51,040
to learn that an officer with nine
years' experience in the cavalry,

589
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:56,104
and to whom I am surrendering command
of this troop in two more days,

590
00:54:56,142 --> 00:54:59,173
should have so little
grasp of leadership,

591
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:04,006
as to allow himself to be
chivvied into a go at fisty-cuffs

592
00:55:04,082 --> 00:55:07,152
while taps still sounds
over a brave man's grave.

593
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,836
God help this troop when I'm gone.

594
00:55:09,913 --> 00:55:11,754
- Sir - - You're
at attention!

595
00:55:11,831 --> 00:55:15,822
- It was a misunderstanding.
- You get back to the troop area!

596
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:23,417
Mr Cohill, you will have the men
build their squad fires higher.

597
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:27,023
Make the fullest show of
bedding down for the night.

598
00:55:27,137 --> 00:55:29,094
Then we're sneaking out,

599
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,320
heading for the river,

600
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:33,122
going back.

- I'm sorry, Flint.

00:55:58,133 --> 00:56:02,239
Our old friend Mr Rynders is
doing some trading down there.

604
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:04,310
Mr Rynders, eh?

605
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:06,688
Alright

606
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:10,909
Pass the word
- Mr Pennell forward.

- He said $50 is too much.
- Too much, huh?

613
00:56:56,328 --> 00:56:59,896
Tell him I know he's got
the paymaster's money,

614
00:57:00,202 --> 00:57:02,542
and I know he killed Major Cheadle.

615
00:57:02,697 --> 00:57:05,843
And tell him it's $50, or no rifle.

- Sergeant?

621
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:48,002
- It's cocked, Sir.
- No, your knife.

622
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:11,094
Do you wanna chaw of tobacco?

623
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:14,739
No, sir. I don't chaw,
and I don't play cards.

624
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:16,812
Oh.

625
00:58:18,115 --> 00:58:21,452
Chawing tobacco's a nasty habit.

00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:24,676
Been known to turn a man's stomach.

627
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,125
I'll take a chaw, if you please, Sir.

628
00:58:35,685 --> 00:58:37,680
Thank you, Sir.

629
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:41,861
Let's go.

630
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:56,515
Still figuring on resigning, mister?

631
00:58:56,593 --> 00:58:58,087
No, sir.

01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,572
Pass the word! Officers
and sergeants forward!

633
01:00:32,649 --> 01:00:34,836
Officers and sergeants forward!

634
01:00:38,021 --> 01:00:41,012
Sergeant Tyree! Find
me a trail to the river.

635
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,586
Right, Sir!

636
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:46,728
A rear guard will stay
here with one officer.

637
01:00:46,804 --> 01:00:48,839
- Sir, I'd - - Thank
you, Mr Pennell.

638
01:00:48,914 --> 01:00:52,329
Your offer to volunteer
will go on your record.

639
01:00:52,406 --> 01:00:54,286
Do you still wish to make one?

640
01:00:54,976 --> 01:00:59,464
Mr Cohill, you will be in command.
Take two squads, cover our crossing.

641
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,880
Deny the hostiles
the use of this ford.

642
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,067
First squad! Second squad!

643
01:01:04,106 --> 01:01:06,867
Second squad has too
many old married men.

644
01:01:06,944 --> 01:01:10,896
First squad! Fifth squad!
Wheel out. Follow in line.

645
01:01:15,692 --> 01:01:17,380
- Can you swim, Dickie?
- No.

646
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:20,487
Well, I'm the best
swimmer in the world.

You know what I've got?

650
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,563
I've got two jars of damson
plums on my pantry shelf.

651
01:01:37,058 --> 01:01:41,509
- They're waiting for you to eat them.
- Tell her about the boat.

652
01:01:43,274 --> 01:01:46,917
Captain - request permission
to stay with the rear guard.

653
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:48,031
Permission refused.

654
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:52,557
Mr Cohill, take the troops across.
I'll take your defence positions.

655
01:01:52,978 --> 01:01:57,161
One pack animal to the rear! Get
back in the that wagon, Quayne.

656
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,174
Forward!

657
01:02:42,696 --> 01:02:44,844
Hang on, Mike, here we go!

658
01:03:59,879 --> 01:04:01,873
Come on, men!

01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,279

back, I promise you. Good luck!

662
01:04:47,294 --> 01:04:51,014
Adjust your saddles and
lift your equipment, men.

Adjust your saddles and
lift your equipment, men.

664
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:55,886
Pass that on, will you?

665
01:04:58,303 --> 01:05:01,296
It's time for me to take my medicine.

666
01:05:08,814 --> 01:05:10,810
It tastes horrible!

667
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,964
Three parties of them, Mr Cohill.

668
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:27,880
This is the only crossing in 20 miles.

669
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:31,909
I need some time. You've
gotta buy me a long day.

670
01:05:31,986 --> 01:05:33,634
Then we'll do it, sir.

671
01:05:33,749 --> 01:05:35,400
I know you will, Flint.

672
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:41,306
Flint? It took you nine years to call
me that, sir. It was well worth waiting.

673
01:05:41,345 --> 01:05:43,532
We'll get you out of here, son.

674
01:05:43,685 --> 01:05:46,410
We'll get you out by noon tomorrow.

675
01:05:46,486 --> 01:05:48,212
Prepare to mount!

676
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,246
Mount!

677
01:05:54,926 --> 01:05:56,959
Flint, wait!

678
01:05:59,913 --> 01:06:04,056
Well, haul off and kiss her
back, We haven't got all day!

679
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:23,504
Alright, Miss
Dandridge, if you please.

680
01:06:27,993 --> 01:06:29,988
Get mounted.

681
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:36,356
- I guess that's how it is, Ross.
- I understand.

682
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:39,157
Forward...

683
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:40,538
Yo!

DISTANT GUNFIRE

685
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:56,456
I have to report the
mission a failure.

686
01:07:56,646 --> 01:08:00,521
No, it was our fault! You did
everything a man could do -

687
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:05,432
I've never worn a coat of whitewash
yet, Abby. I won't start now.

688
01:08:05,509 --> 01:08:10,189
I failed at Sudrow's. I failed to
keep Rynder's rifles from the tribes.

689
01:08:10,304 --> 01:08:12,835
I'll leave the army a failure.

690
01:08:13,028 --> 01:08:16,902
- Don't run yourself down
because - - Blast it, Mac!

691
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:20,047
I left Cohill and
two squads back there.

692
01:08:20,123 --> 01:08:22,119
In a sound military move.

693
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:26,914
I'd like to rest the troop
for three hours and start back.

694
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:30,213
I'll have Cohill out of
there by noon tomorrow.

695
01:08:30,328 --> 01:08:33,244
No, Nathan. The troop
can't leave till dawn.

696
01:08:33,396 --> 01:08:36,887
Dawn? Troop ought to
leave before midnight.

697
01:08:37,694 --> 01:08:40,073
Yes, if you were leading it -

698
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,758
but Pennell will need the daylight.

699
01:08:42,796 --> 01:08:45,827
Pennell? That
babe-in-the-wood?

700
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:50,162
Fording a river against a swarm
of hostiles with Winchesters?

701
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:54,150
Aren't you forgetting
you're retiring tomorrow?

702
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:56,683
Tomorrow's all I need, Mac.

703
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,866
Look, 40 years a good soldier.

704
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:03,588
I can't leave Cohill
facing those devils.

705
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:07,271
You need more than a day.
They'll be there all winter.

706
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,415
Then I'll volunteer
as a civilian scout,

707
01:09:10,492 --> 01:09:12,987
as an interpreter, anything.

708
01:09:13,063 --> 01:09:15,748
And I thought you were fond of Cohill.

709
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:17,167
Fond of him?

710
01:09:17,244 --> 01:09:21,003
When Cohill gave an order,
the men would look at you,

711
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,574
to see if he were
doing the right thing.

712
01:09:23,728 --> 01:09:25,837
Do you want to ruin the boy?

713
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:29,252
I know, Mac, but...

714
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:33,587
Pennell must learn to cross
a river under fire. So did we.

715
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:37,500
And Cohill's got to run
his chances. We ran them.

716
01:09:37,576 --> 01:09:39,685
That's what we get paid for.

717
01:09:41,758 --> 01:09:44,252
Well, I guess you're right.

718
01:09:45,977 --> 01:09:48,355
I guess you're right.

719
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:51,847
With your permission I'll
quit the post tomorrow.

720
01:09:51,924 --> 01:09:53,994
Permission granted, Captain.

721
01:09:54,109 --> 01:09:56,411
Where will you go, Nathan?

722
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:59,059
Oh, west, I guess, Abby.

723
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:01,628
California... New settlements.

724
01:10:03,893 --> 01:10:06,233
Old soldiers, Miss Dandridge.

725
01:10:07,459 --> 01:10:10,873
Some day you'll learn
how they hate to give up.

726
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:14,786
Captain of the troop one day
- every man's face turned towards you,

727
01:10:14,903 --> 01:10:17,895
Lieutenants jump when I growl.

728
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:20,387
But tomorrow, I'll be...

729
01:10:20,464 --> 01:10:23,686
glad if a blacksmith
asks me to shoe a horse.

730
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:30,746
Abby, if you start sniffling now...

731
01:10:31,397 --> 01:10:34,887
- And as for you, young
lady - - I'm not crying.

732
01:10:40,105 --> 01:10:42,715
I'd like to stand up and cheer.

733
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:55,987
Time, sir -

734
01:10:56,064 --> 01:10:58,864
And it's a black day for the army.

735
01:11:01,741 --> 01:11:04,042
Did you sleep well, sir?

736
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:06,536
No.

737
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:10,527
I didn't sleep at all.

738
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:14,553
Well...

739
01:11:16,281 --> 01:11:19,158
Clean up the quarters after I'm gone.

740
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:23,223
Sell all this stuff and put
the money in the troop fund.

741
01:11:24,144 --> 01:11:29,746
Give Mrs Allshard my extra saddle.
It'll be easier on her... disposition.

742
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:33,467
- And the oya, Sir?
- The oya?

743
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:34,886
Oh, yes.

744
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,457
The water bowl.

745
01:11:39,797 --> 01:11:42,327
Well! How did it ever get there?

746
01:11:42,404 --> 01:11:44,592
Now, how do you suppose?

747
01:11:44,669 --> 01:11:49,539
- How long have you know it, sir?
- Since the battle of Bull Run, stupid.

748
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:52,840
And you've been deceiving
me all these years.

749
01:12:06,035 --> 01:12:08,260
Well, there's that.

750
01:12:11,635 --> 01:12:15,433
I'd say my retirement was
an occasion for a drink.

751
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,963
- Help yourself.
- No, I'd take no pleasure in it, sir.

752
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,799
But if it's an order,
here's to your health.

753
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:33,655
Only 14 days for myself and I'll be
wearing one of those monkey suits too.

754
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:35,650
Only one I ever owned.

755
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:41,404
I was a barefoot lad in blue jeans when
I left daddy's farm to join the army.

756
01:12:41,674 --> 01:12:45,662
Well, Sergeant, I haven't
had a drink since that day,

757
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,652
but I'd like to drink
to your retirement.

758
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:52,300
No, sir! I'll do the honours for you.

759
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:54,409
Well, thank you.

760
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:04,231
Wait, Captain, till I get your blouse.

761
01:13:04,269 --> 01:13:05,995
What?

762
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:10,484
- The men will like it, Sir.
- Oh, yeah.

763
01:13:10,597 --> 01:13:12,554
Last time.

764
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:16,966
I'll review the troops
alone this morning, Sergeant.

765
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:22,529
Break in that suit of store
clothes for me, will you?

766
01:13:22,604 --> 01:13:23,910
A suit?

767
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,054
Yeah! Try it on! See how it looks.

768
01:14:16,197 --> 01:14:19,342
- C Troop, all present, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

769
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:24,636
Men,

770
01:14:25,634 --> 01:14:27,858
I won't be going out with you.

771
01:14:29,776 --> 01:14:32,576
I won't be here when you return.

772
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,105
I wish I could.

773
01:14:37,756 --> 01:14:42,281
But I know your performance
under your new commander

774
01:14:42,398 --> 01:14:45,275
will make me proud of you...

775
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:51,144
as I've always been proud of you.

776
01:14:52,294 --> 01:14:56,284
One moment please,
Captain. Corporal Krumrein!

777
01:14:58,624 --> 01:15:01,385
Sir, a small token from the troop.

778
01:15:02,882 --> 01:15:07,409
They all put in the hat for it, sir
- even Sergeant Hochbauer.

779
01:15:12,819 --> 01:15:16,193
It's solid silver, sir.
Brought from Kansas City.

780
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:18,534
There's a sentiment on the back.

781
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:39,556
"To Captain Brittles from C Troop."

782
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:42,739
(SNIFFS)

783
01:15:45,616 --> 01:15:47,651
"Lest we forget."

784
01:15:50,643 --> 01:15:53,060
(CLEARS THROAT AND SNIFFS)

785
01:15:55,937 --> 01:15:57,893
Thank you, Corporal.

786
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:00,579
Thank you.

787
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:02,802
Thank all of you.

788
01:16:08,328 --> 01:16:11,320
(SNIFFS) Take your troop, Mr Pennell.

789
01:16:12,393 --> 01:16:14,619
Proceed on your mission.

790
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:17,687
Good luck, C Troop!

791
01:16:28,007 --> 01:16:30,002
S0NG: THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME

792
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:48,837
I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill

793
01:16:48,913 --> 01:16:50,986
And o'er the moor and valley

794
01:16:51,101 --> 01:16:53,056
Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill

795
01:16:53,094 --> 01:16:55,128
Since parting with my Sally

796
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:57,316
I seek for one as fair and gay

797
01:16:57,391 --> 01:16:59,424
But find none to remind me

798
01:16:59,463 --> 01:17:01,612
How sweet the hours I passed away

799
01:17:01,687 --> 01:17:04,104
With the girl I left behind me

800
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:55,969
Oh.

801
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:58,080
Give me a side view.

802
01:18:00,037 --> 01:18:04,025
That's perfect! It's
made for you, Quincannon

803
01:18:05,099 --> 01:18:08,093
You should go to the
sutler's and order one,

804
01:18:08,169 --> 01:18:10,470
so that when you retire you...

805
01:18:10,548 --> 01:18:14,766
Here, have a couple of
drinks while you're waiting.

806
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:44,343
You're out of uniform, Quincannon.

807
01:18:45,227 --> 01:18:47,297
- Oh, I am, am I?
- You are.

808
01:18:47,374 --> 01:18:49,945
Well, I'm in the proper uniform.

809
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:53,090
The uniform of a retired gentleman.

810
01:18:55,507 --> 01:18:56,811
Hochbauer!

811
01:18:56,926 --> 01:18:58,844
Hochbauer!

812
01:18:58,883 --> 01:19:00,225
Yes, sir?

813
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:04,868
Sergeant Quincannon is improperly
dressed on duty and he's drunk.

814
01:19:04,943 --> 01:19:07,399
Throw him in the guard house.

815
01:19:07,514 --> 01:19:09,278
Alone, Sir?

816
01:19:09,317 --> 01:19:12,042
Afraid of him? We'll
get you some help.

817
01:19:12,156 --> 01:19:14,842
Wagner, give Hochbauer a hand.

818
01:19:21,247 --> 01:19:23,013
Come, Fritz.

819
01:19:25,315 --> 01:19:28,307
- How do I look, Connolly?
- What'll you have?

820
01:19:29,572 --> 01:19:33,639
A little drop of whisky -
Irish - and I'll pour it myself.

821
01:19:35,365 --> 01:19:39,622
And... and when I've drained
that up, just throw me out.

822
01:19:41,924 --> 01:19:45,377
Hans, I want you to help
me arrest Quincannon.

823
01:19:45,454 --> 01:19:48,868
I'd love to throw that
big Mick in the cooler.

824
01:19:57,883 --> 01:19:59,647
You're under arrest, Quincannon.

825
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:00,876
By whose orders?

826
01:20:00,952 --> 01:20:04,442
Captain Brittles'. Are
you coming peaceably?

827
01:20:04,596 --> 01:20:09,314
Laddie, I've never gone any
place peaceably in my life.

828
01:20:17,678 --> 01:20:20,285
You're just in time
for a drink, Wagner.

829
01:20:29,032 --> 01:20:32,946
Ach, Connolly, the old
days, they've gone forever.

830
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:46,028
Connolly, did you hear
- the buffalo are back?

831
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,444
- Buffalo?
- Herds of them.

832
01:20:53,814 --> 01:20:56,884
Men, now we want no unpleasantness.

833
01:20:57,688 --> 01:21:02,216
A toast first, and the guard house after
- if you're able.

834
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:10,387
And it's on me
- I'm paying.

835
01:21:16,295 --> 01:21:18,980
To Captain Nathan Brittles...

836
01:21:20,898 --> 01:21:22,893
on his retirement.

837
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,693
To Captain Nathan Brittles!

838
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:39,158
I... I... I thank you comrades.

839
01:21:39,235 --> 01:21:42,151
This has been a very pleasant moment.

840
01:21:45,411 --> 01:21:47,136
Goodbye, Mr Connolly.

841
01:21:47,213 --> 01:21:49,209
Goodbye, Mr Quincannon.

842
01:21:51,089 --> 01:21:54,195
- Are you hurt, Hans?
- He's alright, sarge.

843
01:22:20,934 --> 01:22:24,195
Come and have a little
sup before you go.

844
01:22:24,462 --> 01:22:26,495
Wagner, come and join us.

845
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:40,460
Sanders! Waiter!

846
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,212
- What is going on?
- Are you alright?

847
01:22:47,288 --> 01:22:49,590
I just had a nip for my cold, doctor.

848
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:52,351
To the guard house. Quick march!

849
01:22:52,428 --> 01:22:53,732
Hup!

850
01:22:55,843 --> 01:22:58,874
- Watch the steps.
- Aren't you ashamed?

851
01:22:58,949 --> 01:23:02,594
- Eight of you against one man?
- Only seven, ma'am.

852
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:04,703
Forward, yo!

853
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:17,901
Alright, Nathan, I get it! Ten days
in the guard house and no charges.

854
01:23:17,978 --> 01:23:21,277
Can't you make it two
weeks, Mac? Till he retires?

855
01:23:21,315 --> 01:23:27,221
A man with a thirst like that couldn't
get by on less than a sergeant's pension.

856
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:31,250
I'll give you my word on it,
he'll retire as top soldier.

857
01:23:31,366 --> 01:23:33,091
Thanks, Mac.

858
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,624
Well, on my way. Goodbye, Mac.

859
01:23:39,498 --> 01:23:41,493
Say goodbye to Abby.

860
01:23:43,717 --> 01:23:48,397
He will do no such thing. We
don't say goodbye in the cavalry.

861
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:50,662
To our next post, dear.

862
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:55,187
Could I haul off and
kiss you too, Captain?

863
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:15,826
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Goodbye, Nathan.

864
01:24:16,823 --> 01:24:19,433
May the road be kind to you.

865
01:24:33,932 --> 01:24:38,881
'Signal smokes, war drums, feathered
bonnets against the western sky.'

866
01:24:38,959 --> 01:24:40,954
'New messiahs, young leaders,

867
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:46,515
are ready to hurl the finest light
cavalry in the world against Fort Starke.'

868
01:24:47,973 --> 01:24:49,969
CHANTING

869
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:56,106
'In the Kiowa village,

870
01:24:56,222 --> 01:25:00,634
the beat of the drums echoes in
the pulse beat of the young braves.'

871
01:25:00,785 --> 01:25:04,161
'Fighters under one banner,
old quarrels forgotten,

872
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:07,959
Comanche rides with Arapaho,
Apache with Cheyenne.'

873
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:14,022
'All chant of war to drive the white
man from the red man's hunting ground.'

874
01:25:21,846 --> 01:25:24,456
'Only the old men stand silent.'

875
01:25:24,571 --> 01:25:29,020
'Even Pony That Walks has been
howled down at the counsel fires.'

876
01:25:29,634 --> 01:25:31,475
Captain Brittles!

877
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:33,355
Captain Brittles, sir!

878
01:25:33,469 --> 01:25:35,733
Captain Brittles, sir!

879
01:25:37,191 --> 01:25:39,224
CHEERING

880
01:25:44,096 --> 01:25:48,509
- Captain Brittles, glad to see you.
- And I, you, sir.

881
01:25:48,547 --> 01:25:50,157
Report, Mr Pennell.

882
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:53,457
We effected the relief
with no casualties.

883
01:25:53,533 --> 01:25:55,489
My compliments.

884
01:25:55,949 --> 01:25:57,983
Report, Mr Cohill.

885
01:25:58,022 --> 01:26:00,055
We've trailed them all day.

886
01:26:00,132 --> 01:26:04,429
It's a big concentration
- Arapahos, Kiowas, Comanches,

887
01:26:04,543 --> 01:26:07,267
800 or 900 Cheyenne Dog Soldiers.

888
01:26:07,381 --> 01:26:11,218
They're getting ready to
strike, but we must strike first.

889
01:26:11,294 --> 01:26:14,902
- I'm glad the Major sent you.
- He didn't send me.

890
01:26:14,978 --> 01:26:19,773
- Then the orders haven't changed.
- Orders are orders, sir.

891
01:26:19,849 --> 01:26:21,844
For the next four hours,

892
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:25,834
according to my brand new
silver watch and chain,

893
01:26:25,949 --> 01:26:29,516
I'm an officer in the
United States Cavalry.

894
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:33,927
If I gave you a written order,
Flint, would you obey it?

895
01:26:33,966 --> 01:26:37,420
- I don't need a written order.
- You're getting one.

896
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:40,220
Might come in handy
at our court marshall.

897
01:26:40,297 --> 01:26:44,094
Sergeant Tyree, I'm ordering
you to volunteer again.

898
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:47,125
- Put your guard on.
- Yes, sir.

899
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,196
Guard on!

900
01:26:50,309 --> 01:26:52,841
Stay here. Do nothing until I return.

901
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:57,176
If I don't, those are your orders
- don't lose them.

902
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:40,447
Locate the pony herd.

903
01:27:41,981 --> 01:27:44,053
Are you ever scared, Captain Tyree?

904
01:27:44,131 --> 01:27:47,198
Yes, sir. I'm tooing and tooting now.

905
01:27:48,272 --> 01:27:49,962
DRUMMING

906
01:28:31,047 --> 01:28:32,810
Ah, Nathan!

907
01:28:32,927 --> 01:28:34,306
Nathan!

908
01:28:34,384 --> 01:28:36,417
I am a Christian!

909
01:28:36,456 --> 01:28:38,488
Hallelujah!

910
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:42,746
Old friend me
- long time, long time.

911
01:28:42,823 --> 01:28:45,355
I come in peace, Pony That Walks.

912
01:28:45,432 --> 01:28:47,618
Take of salt, Nathan.

913
01:28:47,733 --> 01:28:49,729
Take salt.

914
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:55,023
Smoke pipe.

915
01:28:55,138 --> 01:28:56,442
Good.

916
01:28:56,519 --> 01:28:57,862
Good.

917
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:06,071
Pony That Walks, my heart
is sad at what I see.

918
01:29:06,953 --> 01:29:11,095
Your young men painted for
war, their scalp knives red.

919
01:29:11,172 --> 01:29:13,167
The medicine drums talking.

920
01:29:13,244 --> 01:29:16,774
- It is a bad thing.
- A bad thing, Nathan.

921
01:29:16,965 --> 01:29:18,538
Many will die -

922
01:29:18,654 --> 01:29:21,492
my young men, your young men.

923
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:23,295
No good. No good.

924
01:29:23,909 --> 01:29:27,360
- We must stop this war.
- Too late, Nathan.

925
01:29:27,514 --> 01:29:30,238
Young men do not listen to me,

926
01:29:30,314 --> 01:29:33,039
they listen to big medicine.

927
01:29:33,114 --> 01:29:35,762
Yellow-hair, Custer, dead.

928
01:29:35,878 --> 01:29:38,179
Buffalo, come back.

929
01:29:38,256 --> 01:29:40,251
Great sign.

930
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:41,977
Too late, Nathan.

931
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:44,931
You come with me,

932
01:29:45,008 --> 01:29:47,615
hunt buffalo together.

933
01:29:47,692 --> 01:29:51,146
Smoke many pipes.

934
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:53,524
We are too old for war.

935
01:29:55,748 --> 01:29:58,165
Yes, we are too old for war,

936
01:29:59,162 --> 01:30:01,541
but old men should stop wars.

937
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,957
Too late, too late.

938
01:30:04,035 --> 01:30:06,989
Many squaws will sing the death songs.

939
01:30:07,104 --> 01:30:10,442
Many lodges will be empty.

940
01:30:10,517 --> 01:30:12,551
You come with me.

941
01:30:12,705 --> 01:30:15,275
We hunt buffalo.

942
01:30:16,196 --> 01:30:18,343
Get drunk together.

943
01:30:18,421 --> 01:30:20,991
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

944
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:22,985
No, friend, I must go.

945
01:30:24,175 --> 01:30:26,170
I go far away.

946
01:30:26,936 --> 01:30:28,931
Then, Nathan,

947
01:30:29,009 --> 01:30:31,080
my brother...

948
01:30:33,035 --> 01:30:35,069
go in peace.

949
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:42,090
ALL: (KIOWA FAREWELL)

WHIMPERING

951
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:59,736
Easy, pup. Easy.

952
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:10,286
- Pass the word - mount.
- Pass the word - mount.

953
01:31:10,401 --> 01:31:13,047
- Pass the word - mount.
- Pass the word - mount.

954
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:30,426
HORSE WHINNIES

955
01:31:30,502 --> 01:31:34,223
Bugler! Do you wanna get
busted back to horse-shoeing?

956
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,295
Mind that horse.

957
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:38,596
- Tyree?
- Sorry, sir.

958
01:31:53,021 --> 01:31:55,015
Mr Cohill...

959
01:31:55,206 --> 01:31:59,734
can you read the time by
my brand new silver watch?

960
01:32:00,655 --> 01:32:03,339
Yes, sir. Twelve minutes to midnight.

961
01:32:03,493 --> 01:32:04,797
Ah.

962
01:32:06,984 --> 01:32:08,978
Gentlemen...

963
01:32:09,669 --> 01:32:11,471
Bugler...

964
01:32:11,548 --> 01:32:13,274
sound the charge.

965
01:32:14,885 --> 01:32:17,571
ALL: Ya!

966
01:32:17,686 --> 01:32:19,681
GUNFIRE

967
01:33:59,421 --> 01:34:00,725
Sound recall.

968
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:02,759
RECALL

969
01:34:02,797 --> 01:34:04,754
- Any wounded?
- No casualties, sir.

970
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:08,667
Ah. No casualties. No indian
war. No court marshall.

971
01:34:09,703 --> 01:34:13,385
Have your troop follow the
hostiles back to reservation.

972
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:15,532
Follow a mile behind them.

973
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:20,252
Walking hurts their pride
- your watching will hurt it worse.

974
01:34:23,052 --> 01:34:27,233
Can you read what time it is
by my brand new silver watch?

975
01:34:28,575 --> 01:34:31,491
It's two minutes past midnight, sir.

976
01:34:31,568 --> 01:34:33,219
Oh.

977
01:34:34,983 --> 01:34:37,782
I've been a civilian for two minutes.

978
01:34:39,433 --> 01:34:42,885
It's your army, Mr Cohill. Good luck!

'So Nathan Brittles,
ex-captain of cavalry USA,

981

started west for the new
settlements in California -

01:35:07,591 --> 01:35:12,501
towards the setting sun, which is
the end of the trail for all old men.'

983
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:19,980
'But the army sent a galloper
after Nathan Brittles...

Oh, I knew it! Damn
blasted... I knew it!

They're trying to...

990

What?

991
01:35:54,045 --> 01:35:56,309
Sergeant, it's my appointment.

There's three aces for you, boy.

999
01:36:16,335 --> 01:36:18,521
Yeah, but I wish you
had the full hand.

1000
01:36:18,598 --> 01:36:21,513
Huh? Full hand? What
do you mean full hand?

1001
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:24,314
- Robert E Lee, sir.
- Oh.

1002
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:26,807
(LAUGHS) Wouldn't have been bad.

1003
01:36:26,884 --> 01:36:28,188

Sir, you should know that
Miss Dandridge and I -

1010
01:37:29,605 --> 01:37:32,213
Why, son, I knew it all the time.

1011
01:37:32,289 --> 01:37:36,779
Everybody on the post knew it,
above the rank of second Lieutenant.

1012
01:37:36,894 --> 01:37:38,121
Right, Mr Pennell?

1013
01:37:38,198 --> 01:37:40,422
One day, I'll be first Lieutenant.

1014
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,184
- Yeah...
- ALL: In 10 or 12 years.

1015
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:46,675
Will you stay for the dance, Colonel?

1016
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:49,822
If you'll excuse me, Miss Dandridge,

1017
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,468
I've got to make my report first.

1018
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:55,805
Ladies and gentlemen...

1019
01:37:55,883 --> 01:37:57,878
thank you.

1020
01:37:59,027 --> 01:38:01,061
Thank you.

'So, here they are, the
dog-faced soldiers, the regulars,

of the nation's outposts,'

'From Fort Reno to Fort Apache to
Fort Starke, they were all the same.'

that place became the United States.'
