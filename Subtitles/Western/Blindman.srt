763
01:42:42,223 --> 01:42:46,425
  Well, I still have to bring
     those women to Texas.

764
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:49,629
       Would you help me
         round them up?

765
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:51,264
         But the women?

766
01:42:51,266 --> 01:42:53,299
     The general took them.

767
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:57,336
         He took them?

768
01:42:57,338 --> 01:42:58,738
            [Pilar]
      Yes, in the wagons.

769
01:43:03,411 --> 01:43:05,178
              No.

770
01:43:09,918 --> 01:43:11,918
         He took them?

771
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,187
            Oh, no.

772
01:43:18,293 --> 01:43:19,425
             Pilar.

773
01:43:19,427 --> 01:43:20,459
         That general,

774
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:21,794
       that's what I call
            a dirty,

775
01:43:21,796 --> 01:43:23,296
   two-faced son of a bitch.

776
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,265
              Haw!
