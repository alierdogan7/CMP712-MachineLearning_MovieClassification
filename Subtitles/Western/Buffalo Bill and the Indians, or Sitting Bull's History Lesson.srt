1
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,601
Ladies and gentlemen
your attention please.

2
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:50,802
What you are about to experience
is not a show for entertainment.

3
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:56,276
It is a review of the events
that made the American frontier.

4
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,835
In less than 15 years, this nation
will celebrate the 20th century.

5
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:05,120
We do not know
what awaits us in the future

6
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:08,559
but we do know
the past that laid the foundation.

7
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:12,045
And that foundation
was not built from heroes

8
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,523
but from the anonymous settler.

9
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:20,075
Their home was but a shack
roofed in with sod.

10
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:25,635
One door shut out the wind and storm
one window greeted the dawning day.

11
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:29,478
These brave souls
survived not only nature

12
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,918
but the savage instincts of man.

13
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:34,756
Paving the way
for the heroes that endured.

14
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:36,800
Get the rifle!

15
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:49,559
So welcome to the real events
enacted by men and women

16
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:52,043
of the American frontier.

17
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:56,162
To whose courage
strength, and above all, faith

18
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,565
this piece of history is dedicated.

19
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,960
Or:

20
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,965
Cease action!

21
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,797
From the beginning... one... two...

22
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:20,999
Are you in costume?
I want everybody in costume now.

23
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,683
Mr. Salsbury!
Yes?

24
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,120
What is it?

25
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,683
A horse stepped through him.

26
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:36,756
Don't touch him.
Get Eats Rabbit to the dispensary.

27
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:38,879
His name is Brown Horse.

28
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,402
Be careful with him.

29
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:49,165
Tell Joy not to get on the horse
from the back. Doesn't look authentic.

30
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:54,403
I was thinking of setting the hut
on fire. Not a bad idea.

31
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,918
So one day
I was walking through the camp.

32
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,519
I saw this
scrawny looking kid under a wagon.

33
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:04,835
I take one look at him
and I know I can make him a star.

34
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:09,201
I ask him his name.
He says, "Cody, Bill Cody."

35
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:13,436
I say, "What do you do?" He says
"I'm a scout and a buffalo hunter."

36
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:17,357
Well, I want to write about somebody.

37
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:20,276
I had all these new plots for Hickok
but I was mad at him.

38
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:23,844
So I say to the kid
"Your name is now Buffalo Bill

39
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,240
and in 6 months, the whole country
will know about you."

40
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,995
At a church service in Deadwood

41
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:43,237
I met and rubbed elbows with
a young man named William F. Cody.

42
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,086
I was so impressed

43
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:49,646
by his skill as a marksman
by his success as a hunter

44
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:53,081
that I named him
"Buffalo Bill."

45
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,680
Nate, take a look.

46
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,119
She's doing good with her left hand.
Show him, honey.

47
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,683
Beautiful. Just like the old missy.

48
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:10,122
The stories were a big success.
The kid is scared to death

49
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:14,560
about the legend I created
but ex cited about his new fame.

50
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:18,397
And I say one thing
just one thing

51
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:23,796
"Bill, any youngster figures
to set the world on fire

52
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,887
best not forget
where he got the matches.

53
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:31,286
I want you to back me up
on this one against Bill.

54
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:44,445
Which is why you've gotta make it
clear to Bill how serious it could be.

55
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:48,282
Are you listening to me, Nate?

56
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:52,197
Ex cuse me, we're trying to have
a conversation about Annie Oakley.

57
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:56,925
I don't want to push you, but I am her
husband and have a solemn duty...

58
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,483
Dammit, are you gonna tell him or not?

59
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,802
Maybe you
should tell him yourself, Frank.

60
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:07,598
What can I do for you?
All right, I will.

61
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,399
Major Burke's in there with him...

62
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,236
Oh yeah? It's damn important.

63
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:17,606
Good to see you, Frank.

64
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:22,405
My glass suddenly got empty. Could you
put a couple of fingers in there?

65
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:24,402
Thank you, Frank.

66
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,205
My pleasure. If you don't want to
play Mexicans I've got other people.

67
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:34,323
We still want to be part of the show.
You do? As Mexicans? No...

68
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:39,363
I used to play a colored.
Do I look like a colored? No, sir.

69
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:45,803
When I had to play a colored
I was a colored.

70
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:51,198
Good you can be
Rodriguez and Ricardo.

71
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:56,881
Or "Los latiguerros Mexico"
that has to do with whips.

72
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,762
Frank would you mind gettin' out
of my... Conference, Bill.

73
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:06,324
...my conference here
and waitin' like the others?

74
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:08,519
Ed!
Yes, sir?

75
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:13,040
I thought I said no interruptions.
You gotta honor my wishes.

76
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,199
Adios, pard. Wish me luck.

77
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:20,881
You got me, you don't need luck.
And anything historical is mine.

78
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,602
Everything historical is yours, Bill.

79
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:37,966
Going past the dispensary?
Yeah, come on.

80
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:43,160
Major! Yes?
"Bull's eye. Heroic villains.

81
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:48,363
Revolutionize. Injuns. Whites."
What's the plot, Major?

82
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,724
You string those pearls together

83
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,922
and write a unique Buffalo Bill fable.

84
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,876
Let me read it when I get back.

85
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:04,198
I'll even give you the legend.
Enemies in '76, friends in '85.

86
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,876
Ah, Shakespeare of the half dime.
Sit down.

87
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:25,406
Something's up, Ned. Bill sent
Burke out of here on the fly.

88
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,044
Any ideas?
Burke gave me a few clues.

89
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:34,960
Injuns and whites
heroic villain, 50 bucks a week

90
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:39,358
foes in '75, friends in '86.

91
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:42,037
Foes in '75...

92
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,080
Friends in '86...

93
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:49,920
Bill's in the big time now.
He can afford to spend $50 a week.

94
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:55,163
Now tell me
what Injun villain is worth that much?

95
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,160
Sitting Bull!

96
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,196
Is he tame?

97
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:02,045
What about the army?
The army would love it.

98
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:05,485
They can't shoot him.
Not until the Sioux sign the treaties.

99
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:08,999
So they make a fool of him
in a Wild West show.

100
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,324
A rock ain't a rock once it's gravel.

101
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:17,445
What'd he mean by "rock and gravel?"
That he's lost his power.

102
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:21,004
Authors always have their literalisms.

103
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,961
I hear the new act
is General Custer's brother.

104
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,802
That's not what we heard.
What'd you hear?

105
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,079
We know who it is, Eddy.
Who?

106
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,518
Sitting Bull.

107
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,282
Is he interested in the show business?

108
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:38,640
If he wasn't
he wouldn't have become a chief.

109
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:43,445
In my youth I fought
with a young brave of the Sioux tribe

110
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:47,118
named Standing Bull.
And I beat him.

111
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:50,924
When he sat on the ground
after the fight was over

112
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:55,520
and swore revenge on me
by all the Gods of heaven and hell

113
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,836
I laughed at him
and called him "Sitting Bull."

114
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,598
I tell you, there's
no business like show business.

115
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:19,881
People say that Bill's destroyed his
reputation by drinking. It ain't so.

116
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:23,604
He wouldn't
let anything harm his troop.

117
00:11:24,127 --> 00:11:26,277
So you can put those stories to rest.

118
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:29,839
But Bill's drinking
that's a different matter.

119
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:34,485
2 months ago, Nate Salsbury
asked Bill to stop drinking.

120
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:39,000
And Bill promises solemnly
to never be seen drunk again.

121
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:43,605
Till one day Bill says to Nate
he's been giving it some thought

122
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:47,324
and he'll need at least
one drink a day.

123
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:53,046
Of course Bill's daily ration comes in
a glass the size of a small ship.

124
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:30,237
Ladies and gentlemen
America's national entertainer.

125
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:35,761
Put it together for William F. Cody
Buffalo Bill!

126
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:04,921
Great start.

127
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:17,395
See that girl who works
in the laundry over there?

128
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:24,239
I saw here the other day, between
the tents... hugging a man.

129
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,997
Don't talk to Annie
while she's shooting.

130
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:31,076
You're shaking.
Honey, I'm fighting the wind.

131
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,802
Get everybody to the podium.

132
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:37,482
The entire company to the podium.

133
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,724
You look very stylish, Missy.

134
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,757
We thought we'd bitten off
more than was chewable.

135
00:13:57,287 --> 00:14:01,280
And that by enlarging our show
we had possibly disimproved it.

136
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,880
Oh, that's fine, really fine.
Bill, I have got to talk to you.

137
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:15,246
We got a serious problem.
Ned Buntline's back again.

138
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,485
Why didn't you tell me?

139
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,077
...even down to the Indians.

140
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:21,960
Watch this.

141
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,845
Now, Nate Salsbury doesn't long wind.

142
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:28,279
But he want's to say
he's proud that you're proud

143
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:33,006
to be part of
America's national family.

144
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:39,683
I know you'll be upset if he writes
anything harmful about our Annie.

145
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:45,122
Buntline is here. Say the word
and I'll have him removed.

146
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,717
I couldn't do that, Nate.

147
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:53,927
Look, get rid of him without me
telling him. And don't tell me.

148
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:06,003
What's going on over there?
It's Brown Horse's funeral.

149
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:08,563
He died three days ago.

150
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:11,362
Wasn't he Shoshone?
Yes.

151
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:18,836
I won the medal of honor for killing
every Shoshone in a raiding party.

152
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,686
Doesn't seem long ago.

153
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:24,279
You rode into the valley of death
and rode out again.

154
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:31,127
The last thing a man wants to do
is the last thing he does.

155
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:38,436
That was the best rehearsal yet.
Your entrance was tremendable.

156
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:43,199
That was a good idea of yours.
Giving the Injuns slower horses.

157
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,077
Bill?

158
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,438
Money in the bank.

159
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:55,726
Remember what I told you about
telling me. I won't tell you.

160
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:02,117
Business is good.
And it's getting better.

161
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:05,957
That's 'cause
times are bad and getting worse.

162
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,524
Show business
flourishes when times are bad.

163
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:12,199
I hope it stays that way.

164
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:16,037
Well, if it ain't nervous Nate.

165
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,917
You're not doing anybody
a favor by being here.

166
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:25,565
I ain't in the favor business.
I want you to leave my camp, now.

167
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:32,476
It surely is your camp, ain't it?
And you're doing a fine job.

168
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:34,322
Better than I could.

169
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:39,967
What a citizen you've made of Bill.
Doesn't seem like the same man.

170
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:44,361
Never looks bad in public.
All I care about is the Wild West.

171
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,605
We're going to Codyfy the world.

172
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:52,116
Why didn't I think of that?
Because I tell him the truth.

173
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:54,399
And in the end we always agree.

174
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:59,722
If two partners always agree
then one of them ain't necessary.

175
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:06,402
We just signed the most futurable act
in our history. I don't want problems.

176
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:08,519
Who's the act?

177
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,045
Sitting Bull.

178
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:21,999
That's quite a coup.

179
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,397
But you tell Bill Cody

180
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,715
that I don't leave
until he personally invites me out.

181
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:40,037
The great chief of the Sioux tribe
Sitting Bull, is here with us.

182
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:46,203
And he'll be in the same arena
with the noblest white skin of all.

183
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:47,796
I'm speaking about...

184
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:56,645
...the great counterpoint...
Sitting Bull and William F. Cody!

185
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:05,516
Nate, John's going to ride to
the top of Bill's list for this one.

186
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:09,642
Charm, sincerity, sweetness and
youthfulness speak of the man

187
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,761
as the recreation of God
in human form.

188
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,959
Uncle Will
you only got a few minutes.

189
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:28,966
He must be the big one in
the red blanket. No ordinary Indian.

190
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,115
I ain't buying no ordinary Indian.

191
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,127
Go help Nate
with the welcoming committee.

192
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:44,923
Great, great event.

193
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:51,196
He's got more scalps
than any other Indian chief alive.

194
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:55,356
Ready?
No.4, "Major Burke's Return."

195
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:14,921
We have met the enemy and he is ours.

196
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,918
That gentle Sweeny
a melody for every momentous moment.

197
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,123
Where's Bill?
I don't know.

198
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:44,965
Come here and look at Sitting Bull.

199
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:50,840
That sumbitch must be 7 feet tall!
He's getting smaller every year.

200
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:56,282
I'm ready to dispose of my prisoner.
McLaughlin, you are now in Codyland.

201
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:00,402
Sitting Bull is no prisoner, he is
a star in the Buffalo Bill heavens.

202
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:04,681
He's a murderer and my responsibility
till I turn him over to Cody.

203
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,004
Let me introduce Mr. Nate Salsbury.

204
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:10,837
Nate, this remarkable character
is James McLaughlin.

205
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,085
I trust you had a pleasant trip.

206
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:18,522
I hate horsebacking, especially
to deliver Indians to some circus.

207
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:23,564
The Wild West Show is not a circus.
This is show business

208
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:26,681
and Buffalo Bill has an unerring
sense of theatrical timing.

209
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:40,886
That's my star.

210
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,046
He belongs to all of us, Nate.

211
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,805
Our star. America's.

212
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:43,485
Chief Sitting Bull
Killer of Custer.

213
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:50,642
I hope you had
a comfortable journey, Major.

214
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:56,518
Gentlemen, this is a moment
fraught with friendship

215
00:21:57,047 --> 00:21:59,607
with
history humming harmonic overtones.

216
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:04,286
Bill, I have the distinct pleasure

217
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:06,798
of presenting Chief Sitting Bull.

218
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,646
Chief, I'm pleased to present to you

219
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:13,763
the Honorable William F. Cody
Buffalo Bill!

220
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:20,840
I would like to
congratulate you on your arrival

221
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:27,676
and extend a titanically momentous
welcome to Buffalo Bill's Wild West.

222
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:31,517
Now me and my staff are
the best at what we do.

223
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:34,800
And what we do
is make the best look better.

224
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:40,760
Hiya, Chief!

225
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,725
It's the runt.

226
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:52,278
My name is William Halsey.
Sitting Bull speaks through me.

227
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:56,159
His long incarceration
has emptied his strength

228
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:58,917
and he wishes to rest.

229
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:03,161
What's incarceration?
Jail.

230
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,996
Halsey's a white name, isn't it?

231
00:23:08,527 --> 00:23:11,121
Got some white blood in you, Halsey?

232
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,161
Halsey, tell your chief

233
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:20,561
that the people standing here

234
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:25,000
are part of the finest spectacle
in show business.

235
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:27,961
I've watched them grow
from plain, raw talent

236
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,557
to personages of importance.

237
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:33,555
Tell your chief
we can do that for him, too.

238
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:38,877
And after on season in this show
he'll never be mistaken

239
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:43,446
for a below average
run of the mill Indian chief.

240
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:47,960
Plus he'll have something
to fall back on in his later years.

241
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:53,120
Long trip, huh, Chief?

242
00:23:55,927 --> 00:24:01,445
I just wanted to welcome you here
to Buffalo Bill's Wild West.

243
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:04,356
You'll find it ain't
all that different from real life.

244
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:07,447
Gentlemen, Injuns...

245
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:20,725
Why didn't you tell me
which one he was?

246
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:25,365
How big is he off the horse?

247
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:30,446
Don't worry.
He's big enough to fill the arena.

248
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:37,037
So Sitting Bull's the little fellow.

249
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:41,276
He doesn't look so savage.
I'll sleep with a shotgun anyway.

250
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:46,198
Sitting Bull's famous
for scalping folks in their beds.

251
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:49,400
I hope Bill can handle him.

252
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:58,155
I don't think it disappropriate
to play a personal chord here.

253
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:01,759
We all know
sociable chaff is cheap

254
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:04,676
but history...

255
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:08,484
...real history...
is hard come.

256
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:13,764
The man I'm about to celebrate is not
a mere personation of a patriot

257
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:19,995
but the true monarch of genuity.

258
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:29,075
Scout, show man

259
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,844
family person, valued partner...

260
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:51,957
America's National Entertainer
William Frederick..."Bill"...

261
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:02,076
Sitting Bull won't live
with the other Indians.

262
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:06,526
What was that? Sitting Bull doesn't
seem to like his recommodations.

263
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:08,877
What's wrong?

264
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:12,797
He didn't say why.
He wants to live across the river.

265
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,358
He wants to live across the river!

266
00:26:18,847 --> 00:26:22,123
If you're smart you'll lock them
dog eaters in the stockade.

267
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,399
Nobody can cross that river.

268
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:30,561
Impossible. We've already lost
3 horses, 6 Blackfeet

269
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:34,759
and a bargeload of show
equipment, worth $ 16000.

270
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:46,603
Impossible to cross, huh?

271
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:56,638
That's exactly where I want him
on that flat ridge there.

272
00:26:57,727 --> 00:27:01,766
That way I can watch him
all the time from my chair.

273
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:07,407
The difference between
a white man and an Injun

274
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:12,796
in a situation like this
is us whites are smart enough

275
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:17,366
to know an Injun
always turns down your first offer.

276
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,525
Laugh it up, boys.

277
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:26,677
Uncle Will
how did Sitting Bull cross the river?

278
00:27:57,367 --> 00:28:01,360
Shall we call for help?
We are the help.

279
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,161
Shouldn't we holler for help?

280
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:08,676
I'll handle this. Bill, Sitting Bull's
coming here with his whole group.

281
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:14,679
Our unpredictable friends seem to be
on the warpath. I see them.

282
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:19,287
They crossed the river again
and they ain't even wet.

283
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:23,400
They did, huh?
We're with you, Bill.

284
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:30,246
Sonia, finish that later.

285
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,120
Well, Chief...

286
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,120
A twilight raid, huh?

287
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,365
What's on your mind?

288
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:43,765
Sitting Bull is here
by the will of the Great Spirits.

289
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,084
By their will he is chief.

290
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:51,123
His heart is red, sweet, for whatever
passes licks him with his tongue.

291
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,356
The bears taste the honey
and the leaves lick the sky.

292
00:28:55,887 --> 00:29:00,358
The Great Spirits have chosen
Sitting Bull as leader of their land.

293
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,642
Halsey

294
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:07,756
tell Sitting Bull
that Buffalo Bill says

295
00:29:08,287 --> 00:29:12,678
his leaves can turn how he wants, so
long he knows how the wind is blowing.

296
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:19,721
I think I gave him back
the same murky logic he gave us.

297
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,762
What Buffalo Bill means...
He doesn't need an interpreter.

298
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:28,678
Buffalo Bill means that Sitting Bull
is here to relive his history

299
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:31,641
for thousands of paying customers.

300
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:36,479
Sitting Bull says history
is simply disrespect for the dead.

301
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,924
When did he say that?
He's not even listening.

302
00:29:39,447 --> 00:29:42,996
Sitting Bull's mind is rested
and he's ready to negotiate.

303
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:46,519
What? That's been done. Right, Burke?

304
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,639
Sitting Bull wants blankets.

305
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:54,805
They're cold. Couldn't we write
8, 10 blankets into the deal?

306
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,887
Sitting Bull
wants blankets for all his people.

307
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:02,286
Hold on. What do you think
this is? An Army surplus store?

308
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:06,595
There are only 106
Hunkpapa Sioux left at Grand River.

309
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:08,640
106?

310
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:12,965
God, Burke, five years ago we
counted 10000 braves alone.

311
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,604
Mr. Halsey, we're delighted

312
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:21,762
to give the blankets
as a gift to those people.

313
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,642
Burke, get a story out
on this right away.

314
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:30,924
Splash it over the front pages.
"The benevolence of Buffalo Bill."

315
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,759
A fascinating follow up
to today's events, Chief.

316
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:38,524
Negotiations settled.

317
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,078
See that he doesn't steal anything.

318
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:48,005
Sitting Bull want 6 weeks salary
sent to his people now.

319
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,360
He wants what?
I thought Burke took care of that.

320
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:55,357
Music box.
Makes music.

321
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:13,355
Halsey, there's
no prepayment without a contract.

322
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:19,245
And he will own his own photographs.
Like hell! I own all rights.

323
00:31:19,767 --> 00:31:23,601
Sitting Bull says his face belongs
to him and he owns his photographs.

324
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:25,799
My ass!

325
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:28,957
Nate!

326
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:34,642
That's robbery, and he knows it!
I won't put up with it!

327
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,998
We won't put up with it.

328
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:40,719
It's bedlam in here.
I'm going to take a nap.

329
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:44,876
Margaret!

330
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:49,320
Stop that singing.
You getting' sharp with me, Bill?

331
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,235
You see?

332
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,239
You've upset Buffalo Bill.

333
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:00,358
Halsey, tell the chief

334
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,798
we pay for work performed.

335
00:32:03,327 --> 00:32:06,364
If he wants to sign a six month
contract, that's different.

336
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,759
No contract.
Why not?

337
00:32:10,287 --> 00:32:15,077
All the other top acts have them.
He won't sign what he may not honor.

338
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:16,403
Why couldn't he?

339
00:32:17,207 --> 00:32:21,405
Sitting Bull stays only until he sees
the great father. The President?

340
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:22,803
Yes.

341
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:25,602
Did Burke promise you that?

342
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,846
Sitting Bull no longer accepts
promises from white men.

343
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,245
His dreams told him
he would meet the great father here.

344
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:36,237
He is here because he dreamed
he would meet President Cleveland?

345
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:39,243
Dead on, Bill.

346
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,877
What does she say this time?

347
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:47,723
"Dear husband, your deeds
as a frontier hero are pale

348
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:51,364
compared to your adventures
with opera singers and milk maids."

349
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,916
Dead on, Bill!

350
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:06,120
"You are also the cheapest man who
ever lived and a profane drunkard."

351
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:11,756
That's Mr. Oakley.
The name is Butler.

352
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:20,637
"I have instructed my lawyers
to draw up divorce articles

353
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:24,284
ensuring our separation
and making me a rich woman."

354
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,924
I want you to miss this one
just until you get the feel of it.

355
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,886
Take your time.

356
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:33,763
You can miss by a lot, darling.

357
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,165
Good, right in the middle.

358
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:40,802
Did you want to hit it in the middle?

359
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,357
"...your wife, Lulu."

360
00:33:58,447 --> 00:34:02,884
I'm gettin' longer cigars. You'll feel
more comfortable with them.

361
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:08,639
Buffalo Bill, monarch of the West

362
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:14,195
it delights me to present this
completely cornucopious canary

363
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:20,001
this curvacious cadenza in
the companion of classical singsong

364
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:24,162
this collation
of champagne and columbine

365
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:29,403
this cultivated
coloratura from Colorado...

366
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:32,760
words fails me...
Lucille Du Charmes.

367
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:37,685
Handel's "Rinaldo."

368
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:52,559
What a shot you are.

369
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:58,956
My second husband, Count Eggenweiler
was a champion trap shooter.

370
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:02,843
Trap shooting's a different thing
no offence to your second...

371
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,156
...deceased...

372
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:09,722
...husband.
He used a shotgun that sprayed.

373
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:13,205
A pistol
is a more exacting weapon.

374
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:20,206
Burke, take the lady
to my... private viewing chair.

375
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,364
Morning, girls!

376
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:27,557
What's going on?
I wanna show Bull the Custer act.

377
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,157
Here's you scenario.

378
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:35,684
About Cleveland. First, he's marrying
a society dab at the end of the month.

379
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:38,675
Second, he's got a Republican
congress to contend with.

380
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:42,165
I think we can give Bull the money.
If he's waiting for Cleveland

381
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,325
we've got him for life.

382
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:48,479
Bring Sitting Bull and Halsey over.

383
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:52,721
Keep those tempos tight, Bill!

384
00:35:53,247 --> 00:35:56,557
Is the grey alright?
Yeah, she'll dance tomorrow.

385
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,361
Morning, chief.

386
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:03,602
Halsey if you and the chief
would follow me a few, short steps

387
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,924
he'll be part of America's family.

388
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:08,642
If you're gonna watch
watch from the other side.

389
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,282
Ah, by the way

390
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:14,402
you can tell the chief
we've decided to give him

391
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:17,202
2 weeks salary
as a token of our friendship.

392
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:20,480
Sitting Bull admires the big grey.

393
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:24,204
Say hello to Buffalo Bill.
Poor thing is frightened.

394
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:27,480
That bird can't get out, can it?
No...

395
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:33,161
We're the only ones who show the red
and the white without taking sides.

396
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:39,999
Hello, Chief.
Which way are your leaves blowing?

397
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:45,446
Nate, get this thing going.
Down stage!

398
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:53,201
I see General George Armstrong Custer

399
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:57,720
leads the men of the 7 th cavalry
deep into the Injun territory

400
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:00,442
known as "Little Big Horn."

401
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:05,916
Custer bearing the wounds of
a cowardly Sioux ambush.

402
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:08,045
Suddenly Indians appear

403
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:11,604
led by the fiercest of 'em all

404
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:14,357
Chief Sitting Bull!

405
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:18,639
Chief, you got a colored
sitting in for you

406
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:22,796
'cause he's the closest we got
on our staff to a real Injun.

407
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,999
Custer knows
it's gonna be the fight for his life.

408
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,157
Sitting Bull uses an old Injun ploy.

409
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,761
He hates Custer.

410
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:42,004
It's gonna be an honorable duel
between the two great leaders.

411
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:50,806
But George gets shot in the back
by all the other redskins.

412
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,485
Sitting Bull says
the battle did not happen that way.

413
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:57,475
Sitting Bull
was not on the battlefield.

414
00:37:59,047 --> 00:38:01,163
He was making medicine and dreaming.

415
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:03,518
He saw many horses upside down

416
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:07,323
and blue skeletons
floating up to the promised land.

417
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:15,121
Why's he shooting? Put that down
you're gonna hurt somebody.

418
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:18,320
Sitting Bull thinks you're
a great marksman. He can see

419
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:22,078
how you killed
so many of his buffaloes.

420
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:08,400
Someday my hair's
gonna be along as Custer's...

421
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:11,155
...was.

422
00:39:57,847 --> 00:40:02,318
Margaret, I've been thinking about us.
I'm glad, Bill.

423
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:07,716
The more I think about us
the less I think about Sitting Bull.

424
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:12,396
That ain't good for the Wild West.
I'd never interfere with that.

425
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:16,719
That little bastard
ain't gonna make my life easy.

426
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:19,966
I can't deal with him
and deal with you

427
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:23,320
and be my best with the both.

428
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:28,284
I'm trying to say
it's time for you to go. No, Bill.

429
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:33,517
And the quicker you go
the quicker you can start missing me.

430
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:29,404
Margaret, go on.

431
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:33,446
Halsey!

432
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:35,686
What are you doing here?

433
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:40,041
Sitting Bull came to tell you
what he will do in your show.

434
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:45,404
The sun ain't hardly up yet.

435
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:49,557
Sitting Bull's thoughts
do not have a schedule.

436
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:54,398
Let me get myself together.

437
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:57,282
Go and sit down.

438
00:42:05,407 --> 00:42:07,443
What's going on?

439
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:12,836
I don't know
but keep an eye on him.

440
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:15,324
I'll go get your uncle.

441
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:29,799
What's happening?
Get Burke.

442
00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:32,682
Damn Injun caught me with my...

443
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:37,637
Bull kept everybody up.
Bad Bull!

444
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:55,283
My father has promised me this land.
Protecting it I have had a hard time.

445
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,958
The rivers flow
with the blood of my people.

446
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:04,197
The wind blows the echoes of lies.
The white man has stolen the truth.

447
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:14,883
That is a great
and classic Indian face.

448
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:26,925
You'll build
the village at Killdear Mountain.

449
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:31,441
Sitting Bull's people will be working.
Children will be playing.

450
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,006
They're waiting for Colonel McLaren
and his soldiers to talk peace.

451
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:41,038
The unarmed Sioux embrace
the soldiers with open arms.

452
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:47,040
Then McLaren will slaughter
every man, woman, child and dog.

453
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:54,365
He's tolerable.

454
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:56,445
It'll work.

455
00:43:57,527 --> 00:44:00,325
You could come on
after the Indians attack McLaren.

456
00:44:10,087 --> 00:44:13,557
This is what Sitting Bull
has chosen to do.

457
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:54,436
Chief

458
00:44:56,167 --> 00:45:00,160
we haven't had a heart to heart
and I think it's time.

459
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:03,884
I've listened to Halsey.

460
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:07,956
He's got guts, 'cause he did
insult me in my own house.

461
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:10,717
He called me a coward.
Says I murdered

462
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:16,840
women, old men, and children.

463
00:45:17,807 --> 00:45:19,286
And dogs.

464
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:21,126
Yeah, dogs.

465
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,202
You get what I'm saying?

466
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:37,645
You have till noon to get outta here!

467
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:40,322
You're finished! Fired! Through!

468
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:45,841
How could that little runt
treat me like that?

469
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,120
It's harder
being a star than an Indian.

470
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:52,719
Everything on this side
I'm taking with me.

471
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:57,366
What's this?
How did I ever...?

472
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:01,084
I'll pack the guns now.
Don't touch my guns!

473
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:03,000
Uncle Will!

474
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,197
Something awful bad... Annie...
We already know.

475
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:13,086
She going through with it?

476
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:16,679
Looks like it. We all spoke to her.
She's standing firm.

477
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:21,962
I can usually steer her where you want
her to go, but not this time.

478
00:46:22,487 --> 00:46:25,718
Why's everything a problem here?
Is it a matter of money?

479
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:27,885
Money might help.
Come on, Frank.

480
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:31,683
Money has nothing to do with it.
It's Annie's principles.

481
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:35,483
What about my principles?
Then let her leave.

482
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:41,564
Wait a minute. I can't let her go.
She owes me too much.

483
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:46,686
I'll talk to her, but I won't change
my mind about the Injun. Right.

484
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:51,356
If it comes up, or if it'll help
you can tell her I love her.

485
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:54,080
And you take this.

486
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,039
How would you like this?

487
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:00,560
Here, take it.

488
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:09,678
We got problems.
No problem, Bill.

489
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:14,644
I could expect disrespect
from anybody but you.

490
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:21,923
Why are you in the middle of this?
What did Bull ever do for you?

491
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,883
He wants to show the truth.
Why not accept that just once?

492
00:47:27,407 --> 00:47:29,796
Because I got
a better sense of history than that.

493
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:32,283
Besides, I
say what goes on in this show.

494
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:37,244
Not some Injun runt
and his half assed half breed.

495
00:47:38,087 --> 00:47:40,760
You got any whiskey?
Where you want this chair?

496
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,641
If you send Bull back
they'll kill him.

497
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:47,998
That is not my problem.

498
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:51,724
You can have this.
It'll just about fit you.

499
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,917
The little bastard can stay.

500
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,006
Ladies and gentlemen

501
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:50,566
I'm Nate Salsbury, and on behalf
of my partner, Bill Cody

502
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:54,796
we welcome you to the season's
opening show of America's...

503
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:58,125
Mr. Cody, we're ready
for the Grand Parade.

504
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:03,198
...Buffalo Bill's Wild West!

505
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:12,000
And what would the Wild West be
without brave cowboys?

506
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:15,280
You're on in 2 minutes.
I heard you the 1st time.

507
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:29,682
You have to go in the carriage.
Stop nagging.

508
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,438
God, they're gonna make lots of dust.

509
00:49:55,807 --> 00:49:58,560
The brave cowboys
now assume protective positions

510
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:04,366
so that you, our guests, can witness
the true wildness of the West

511
00:50:05,527 --> 00:50:09,042
without bodily risk
from nature's fury.

512
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:16,797
And pursuing the brave and powerful
buffalo is our star

513
00:50:17,327 --> 00:50:21,718
America's national hero
Bill Cody... Buffalo Bill!

514
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:48,917
Yes, he was truly born to entertain.

515
00:50:50,287 --> 00:50:51,879
No ordinary man would ever take credit

516
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:56,446
for acts of bravery and
heroism he couldn't have done.

517
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:01,245
And no ordinary man would realize
what huge profits could be made

518
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:06,283
by telling a pack of lies
like it was the truth.

519
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:10,277
No, Bill Cody
can only trust his senses.

520
00:51:11,407 --> 00:51:14,126
And when his senses fail him

521
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:17,719
he might see things
as they really are.

522
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:25,560
And now
as the trooperies reassemble

523
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:29,878
would you join in the singing of

524
00:51:31,127 --> 00:51:34,244
Buffalo Bill's
favorite American song

525
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:38,562
by Francis Scott Key

526
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:40,918
"Oh Say, Can You See."

527
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:44,441
It is Buffalo Bill's belief

528
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:50,087
that this could and should be
the next national anthem.

529
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,279
Would you please rise.

530
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:15,076
And now
to open our show in a big way

531
00:53:15,607 --> 00:53:19,885
we present to you
an unparalleled attraction:

532
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:24,366
The world's foremost woman marksman
the little girl of the western plains

533
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:27,685
the fearless Annie Oakley!

534
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:39,764
Assisted by Frank "the world's most
handsome living target" Butler!

535
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,246
Steady.

536
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:06,722
Tell him to steady the cigar.

537
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:14,402
Coward.

538
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:27,637
We love you, Annie.

539
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:07,678
Move that horse.

540
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:18,920
For her grand finale, Miss Oakley

541
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:22,646
will attempt a new shot
the two for one axe shot.

542
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:25,727
She will split a bullet with the axe

543
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,444
hitting both targets simultaneously.

544
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:35,165
Take your time, honey.
They'll wait forever.

545
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:41,436
Please remain as quiet as possible.

546
00:55:45,327 --> 00:55:48,524
The bullet must split
and hit the two targets.

547
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:52,642
Is that possible?
It's never been done before.

548
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:57,879
Oh, how close!

549
00:56:01,287 --> 00:56:06,122
She missed, but so close!
Give her a hand!

550
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:09,286
Nate, once again.
Again.

551
00:56:09,807 --> 00:56:13,038
What? Frank, again.
Annie, you don't have to.

552
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:17,397
We love you anyway.
I can do it, Frank.

553
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:22,482
Wait, I lost my hat.

554
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:27,837
You ready?

555
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:30,678
Stay with us, Lord.

556
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:02,204
Annie, where you going?
He moved it.

557
00:57:04,207 --> 00:57:06,596
Annie, take a bow.

558
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:12,243
Frank, what will you do?
I can't do the act myself.

559
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:15,040
And now, ladies and gentlemen

560
00:57:15,567 --> 00:57:19,526
here's a man who can
stick to any animal with hair.

561
00:57:20,047 --> 00:57:24,598
Say hello to
the King of Cowboys, Buck Taylor!

562
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:35,241
Alright, the Bull banner.
Is the old man ready?

563
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:40,082
You're on next.

564
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:43,555
Halsey

565
00:57:44,687 --> 00:57:48,441
tell Bull he's going to discover
what show business is all about.

566
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:53,245
He'll be back here begging me
to do the Custer act.

567
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:56,520
Sitting Bull's going to suffer
a worse defeat than Custer ever did.

568
00:57:57,687 --> 00:58:02,078
Custer got to die.
Bull's just going to get humiliated.

569
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:07,522
The most murderous
the most colorful redskin alive...

570
00:58:08,047 --> 00:58:09,400
Here he comes

571
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:13,556
the battling chief
of the Hunkpapa Sioux

572
00:58:14,087 --> 00:58:16,157
Sitting Bull!

573
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:14,798
Morning! You're up.

574
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:23,045
Listen, I...
I'm really sorry about last night.

575
01:01:23,567 --> 01:01:27,162
It was opening night
and we always kick up dust.

576
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:30,155
I don't like them to drink alone.

577
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:37,000
I must have been
kind of a disappointment.

578
01:01:39,367 --> 01:01:41,756
You look real pretty in that light.

579
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:46,046
Actually...

580
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:51,319
I've become a morning man.

581
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:56,282
There's no pressure.
You see, at night...

582
01:01:56,807 --> 01:02:01,085
And the whiskey we get here
isn't good. It dulls the...

583
01:02:07,447 --> 01:02:09,677
Say good morning
to the flying Dutchman.

584
01:02:10,207 --> 01:02:14,564
Hi, bird. He's OK in there?
You don't let him out, do you?

585
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:21,079
What are they doing?
They're just horsing around.

586
01:02:22,087 --> 01:02:24,920
You have to help him.
Stop them. They may hurt him.

587
01:02:25,767 --> 01:02:26,882
Alright.

588
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:34,323
You just stretch out there.
I'll be right back.

589
01:02:46,887 --> 01:02:51,085
Put him down.
It's like a bull fighting a flea.

590
01:02:58,087 --> 01:02:59,839
Son of a bitch!

591
01:03:14,727 --> 01:03:17,525
There's only squaws over there.

592
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:20,720
Nate! Burke! Get over here!

593
01:03:22,847 --> 01:03:24,758
Goddamn!
What is it?

594
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,479
Stay behind the tent!

595
01:03:34,527 --> 01:03:39,157
Problems? Take a look up there
you'll see the problem.

596
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,165
Sitting Bull's making his exit.

597
01:03:48,447 --> 01:03:52,122
Buck Taylor, get across the river
and see what's going on.

598
01:03:59,447 --> 01:04:02,359
Look at that boy go!
Rides like the wind!

599
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:05,162
The Injuns.
Where?

600
01:04:06,327 --> 01:04:07,237
My God.

601
01:04:09,567 --> 01:04:12,035
Why is it so dark in here?

602
01:04:12,567 --> 01:04:15,240
Hey, son, get down.

603
01:04:20,047 --> 01:04:21,446
Gotcha!

604
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:35,115
Boys, I want a posse. A tough posse.
We ride in ten minutes.

605
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:39,359
There's no way to outfox a fox.

606
01:04:39,887 --> 01:04:41,605
We're not taking this lying down.

607
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:45,836
You horse son of a bitch
where are you going?

608
01:04:55,647 --> 01:04:59,196
Damn... damn.
What's wrong?

609
01:04:59,727 --> 01:05:03,356
I got trouble on my hands.
The little cowboy wasn't hurt?

610
01:05:03,887 --> 01:05:06,720
No. The Injuns.

611
01:05:07,247 --> 01:05:09,397
They've escaped.
All of them?

612
01:05:09,927 --> 01:05:13,636
No, just the dangerous ones.
I got to go get them.

613
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:17,682
How long will you be gone?
As long as it takes.

614
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:23,038
You know I'd never let anything
come between us and our little...

615
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:26,320
...unless it was something real
like this.

616
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:34,044
Goddammit! Where's my real jacket?

617
01:05:43,007 --> 01:05:45,077
Well
the posse's formed.

618
01:05:46,607 --> 01:05:51,362
Knowing that you're
laying there waiting for me

619
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:53,878
will serve to stiffen my resolve.

620
01:05:56,887 --> 01:06:00,596
How could you be so clumsy?
You could have harmed him.

621
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:02,765
I hate birds.

622
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:06,996
Cody, don't you ever harm
my Flying Dutchman.

623
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:11,882
Ed, where you going?
With you, Uncle Will. Get off.

624
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:16,121
Your mother would be furious.
Jules, get on the horse.

625
01:06:35,847 --> 01:06:37,997
Where's the Indian
who's supposed to be at this gate?

626
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:34,278
When Bill's dressed for a ride
and mounted on his stallion

627
01:07:34,807 --> 01:07:37,799
any doubts
about his legend are soon forgot.

628
01:07:38,327 --> 01:07:43,640
Yes, Bill's fine physical portrait
hides any faults his mind possesses.

629
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,639
But any tracker will tell you

630
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:52,046
if you don't know what you're after
you'd best stay home.

631
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,037
There they are, Uncle Will!

632
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:27,322
Control yourself.
That'll teach Sitting Bull a lesson.

633
01:08:29,327 --> 01:08:34,401
It's a question of law and order.
Sitting Bull was out of order.

634
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:36,840
Here they come.

635
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:42,242
Now as they come over the ridge
we'll...

636
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:43,756
Wait a minute.

637
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:46,801
I don't see Sitting Bull.

638
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:53,282
No. They're not there. They must be
there. Maybe they're in the back.

639
01:08:55,127 --> 01:08:59,484
I don't see Sitting Bull.
I don't see no Injuns.

640
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:03,477
Maybe they just didn't find them.

641
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:08,637
Oh, they found them. No Injun
ever got away from Uncle Will.

642
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:14,082
Maybe they're dressed in our clothes.
Alright, up stick. It's them.

643
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:16,996
But no down stick.

644
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:20,405
They're not there.

645
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:22,477
Oh, my God.

646
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:27,645
I don't see any Indians with them.
'Cause there ain't no Injuns there.

647
01:09:29,327 --> 01:09:32,637
But Bill's the greatest
Indian hunter of them all.

648
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:36,876
He led fifteen
of the best trackers

649
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:41,400
into territory he knows better
than the back of his own hand

650
01:09:42,447 --> 01:09:47,601
looking for an old man
a giant, and five boys.

651
01:10:43,207 --> 01:10:45,038
It's not your fault, Bill.

652
01:10:46,407 --> 01:10:49,922
We made it clear
that this is a camp, not a prison.

653
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:54,360
Nate's right.
We're not in the prison business.

654
01:10:56,527 --> 01:10:58,677
Better tell
McLaughlin that he's gone.

655
01:10:59,207 --> 01:11:04,156
"Sitting Bull escapes after first
trying to burn down the arena."

656
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:09,481
I sure thought you'd catch him.
They weren't that far ahead.

657
01:11:10,007 --> 01:11:12,396
Ed, why don't you go close the gate?

658
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:32,279
I never saw him refuse a drink before.

659
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:35,716
I don't care what anyone says.

660
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:38,363
God bless Buffalo Bill!

661
01:11:39,247 --> 01:11:41,317
God! He shot himself!

662
01:11:49,687 --> 01:11:51,484
Damn bird.

663
01:11:59,807 --> 01:12:02,082
Get out of here. Sit down.

664
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:06,085
Damn bird!

665
01:12:17,887 --> 01:12:19,559
Well, I hate birds.

666
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:22,046
Me, too.

667
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:38,279
Bull and Halsey are out there.
What? How?

668
01:12:40,887 --> 01:12:42,764
They must have tracked us.

669
01:12:58,087 --> 01:12:59,725
Come on in, boys.

670
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:06,838
Couple of buffs got loose.
We had to chase them down.

671
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:11,565
Too bad you couldn't join us.
Where were you?

672
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:17,321
It's the first moon of the month.
Answer the question. Where were you?

673
01:13:17,847 --> 01:13:21,965
During the 1st moon
Sitting Bull visits the sun

674
01:13:22,487 --> 01:13:24,842
and the squaws
move teepees to the moon's path.

675
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,803
Stop sunning and mooning us
and tell us where you've been.

676
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:34,722
You were up in the mountains? Yes.
Wasn't that a little dangerous?

677
01:13:35,247 --> 01:13:38,045
Sitting Bull knows the mountains.

678
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:42,242
What if I had sent someone after you?
Sitting Bull was not hiding.

679
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:47,921
In the mountains, Sitting Bull
realized he must do more in your show.

680
01:13:48,447 --> 01:13:52,201
Well, now we're back in business.
Foes in '76, friends in '85.

681
01:13:52,727 --> 01:13:56,197
I don't understand.
Explain that.

682
01:13:56,887 --> 01:14:01,438
Sitting Bull will do the only thing
he would want to show his people.

683
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:03,400
And what is that?

684
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:07,237
Sitting Bull
will make the big grey dance.

685
01:14:14,927 --> 01:14:17,566
Responsibility is a funny thing.

686
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:20,237
It's different for stars
than for ordinary folks.

687
01:14:20,767 --> 01:14:23,156
Please, Buntline, this man's in pain.

688
01:14:23,687 --> 01:14:26,520
That's why stars spend
so much time in front of mirrors.

689
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:30,324
To see if their good looks
can overcome their judgment.

690
01:14:30,847 --> 01:14:33,156
Not now, Mr. Buntline, please.

691
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:37,726
A star like Buffalo Bill Cody
makes a judgment

692
01:14:38,247 --> 01:14:41,762
it becomes a commitment.
It's got to stick at any cost.

693
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:44,719
The only way

694
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:49,445
I could have avoided
seeing him on that mountain

695
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,322
is if he never went to the mountain.

696
01:14:52,847 --> 01:14:55,919
Now I can understand
why he lied to me.

697
01:14:56,447 --> 01:15:01,475
He's got to look good
in front of his people, same as I.

698
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:04,202
But I'm generous and flexible.

699
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:08,405
That's good, generous and flexible.

700
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,845
Ladies and gentlemen
please take the places

701
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:14,597
we have specified for you.

702
01:15:15,127 --> 01:15:17,482
Welcome, braves.
We welcome you with open arms.

703
01:15:18,007 --> 01:15:20,726
Wranglers on the Deadwood coach
easy there.

704
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:24,364
I know the ladies
like to be bounced around a bit

705
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,923
but it'll blur the picture.

706
01:15:28,047 --> 01:15:31,596
This is a very impressive assemblage.
Now, pay attention.

707
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:35,961
Nate, would you convey
to Buffalo Bill that we are ready?

708
01:15:37,327 --> 01:15:39,363
I'm generous and flexible.

709
01:15:40,487 --> 01:15:42,637
Bill!
I'll be there.

710
01:15:45,487 --> 01:15:47,205
Generous and flexible.

711
01:15:49,767 --> 01:15:53,316
I choose to overlook
the entire incident.

712
01:15:57,927 --> 01:16:01,681
100 years from now, this photo
will still exist. Remember that.

713
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:05,001
This is the way
people will remember you.

714
01:16:07,967 --> 01:16:09,446
Bill, good morning!

715
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:15,766
Ladies and gentlemen, Injuns
I didn't know you were ready. Sorry.

716
01:16:17,247 --> 01:16:18,521
Get ready.

717
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:20,799
Look at the birdy!

718
01:16:24,487 --> 01:16:25,397
Hold it!

719
01:16:30,887 --> 01:16:34,038
I don't want Sitting Bull next to
Annie Oakley.

720
01:16:34,567 --> 01:16:37,400
'Cause I don't want
Sitting Bull next to Annie Oakley.

721
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:42,398
The fans won't like it.
Put him with the other Indians.

722
01:16:49,487 --> 01:16:52,957
I don't want
Sitting Bull next to Annie.

723
01:16:55,367 --> 01:16:57,437
Um... Halsey...

724
01:16:57,967 --> 01:17:00,162
It'd be a better idea, with

725
01:17:00,687 --> 01:17:04,202
the sun factor, if you and the chief
moved over with the other Indians.

726
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:09,157
Sitting Bull
will stand by Annie Oakley.

727
01:17:09,687 --> 01:17:13,965
Why don't you just
come over here where you should be?

728
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:18,837
Sitting Bull
will move for $25.

729
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:25,644
I swear he plans these things.

730
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:30,843
What do you want to do?
Let him stay where he is.

731
01:17:32,007 --> 01:17:35,761
We'll put Halsey's face and hat
on Buck Taylor

732
01:17:36,287 --> 01:17:38,801
and Sitting Bull's on
Johnny Baker and vice versa.

733
01:17:39,327 --> 01:17:42,319
That way those two Injuns
will be with the other Injuns.

734
01:17:42,847 --> 01:17:45,441
And don't show him the photograph.

735
01:17:46,447 --> 01:17:50,326
Buffalo Bill says it was better
the first way. Make your photograph.

736
01:17:54,447 --> 01:17:56,722
Everybody hold your breath now!

737
01:18:13,447 --> 01:18:16,041
Hold it a minute. Hey, Dart!

738
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,797
Come here!
Go on, I'm getting my picture took.

739
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:25,081
Wayne, will you... Dart
go find out what that darkey wants.

740
01:18:28,847 --> 01:18:32,317
A wire just came from the President.
This is no time to joke.

741
01:18:32,847 --> 01:18:35,919
It's for real.
It's there. Tell them.

742
01:18:36,887 --> 01:18:40,084
A wire came from
the President of the United States.

743
01:18:51,287 --> 01:18:53,084
Who told you?
You can't read either.

744
01:19:10,127 --> 01:19:12,800
You may take the photograph now.

745
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:19,007
Injuns gear their lives to dreams.

746
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:22,041
And when he dreams
no matter how farfetched it is

747
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:25,566
he'll wait till he dies
for it to come true.

748
01:19:26,087 --> 01:19:28,521
White men, they're different.

749
01:19:29,687 --> 01:19:32,520
They only dream
when things are going their way.

750
01:19:33,047 --> 01:19:34,560
I'm no expert on the subject

751
01:19:35,087 --> 01:19:39,922
but what Bull does is a lot cheaper
than mounting a Wild west show

752
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,244
which is just dreaming out loud.

753
01:19:42,767 --> 01:19:44,439
"The Honorable William F. Cody."

754
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:47,162
"Grover Cleveland, President

755
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:51,521
has chosen to make the first stop
of his honeymoon ex cursion

756
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:56,518
in Buffalo Bill's
Wild West camp at Fort Ruth.

757
01:19:57,047 --> 01:20:02,519
The scheduled time of arrival
is Thursday, October 18th at 8 p. M."

758
01:20:03,047 --> 01:20:06,960
Night!
We've never done a night show.

759
01:20:10,207 --> 01:20:13,517
Uncle Will, it's just like
in Sitting Bull's dream.

760
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:16,840
I bring up this dream business
because

761
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:21,565
things are starting to
take on an unreal shape.

762
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:24,760
Just think for a minute.
Sitting Bull...

763
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:29,360
Put yourself in his place.
You sit in your teepee and you dream.

764
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:33,482
Then you go to wherever
the dream might come true.

765
01:20:34,007 --> 01:20:35,963
And you wait
for real life to catch up.

766
01:20:36,487 --> 01:20:39,923
Mr. President, Mrs. Cleveland

767
01:20:40,447 --> 01:20:44,360
...honored guests.
I'm Nate Salsbury.

768
01:20:47,287 --> 01:20:49,642
And I can tell you
that Nate Salsbury

769
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:56,515
has never been as proud in his
long career as he is tonight

770
01:20:57,047 --> 01:21:03,122
to present our very first
after dark, request performance

771
01:21:03,647 --> 01:21:08,437
and to dedicate it to you
our finest American

772
01:21:08,967 --> 01:21:12,437
and your fine, new wife.

773
01:21:12,967 --> 01:21:16,118
Ed's in the box.
Burke's up there, too

774
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:20,196
laughing it up with the President
while we're stuck down here.

775
01:21:20,967 --> 01:21:22,400
Grover Cleveland.

776
01:21:22,927 --> 01:21:27,762
That bear is a star!
He's bigger than Buck Taylor!

777
01:21:28,287 --> 01:21:32,166
He's bigger than you are.
He's the biggest man I've ever seen.

778
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:36,197
Meet America's national entertainer

779
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:41,243
the man who IS the Wild West
the honorable

780
01:21:41,767 --> 01:21:43,803
William F. Cody

781
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:46,795
Buffalo Bill!

782
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:27,077
Mr. President

783
01:22:27,647 --> 01:22:30,286
Mrs. Cleveland
distinguished visitors

784
01:22:30,807 --> 01:22:35,676
I want to take this occasion
to welcome you to my Wild West.

785
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:37,765
Most people will tell you

786
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:41,723
that it's the father
of the new show business.

787
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:48,723
And may the sun
never set on this great nation

788
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:52,239
unless
it comes up again in the morning.

789
01:22:53,127 --> 01:22:57,837
Mr. President
our wedding present for you.

790
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,242
Buffalo Bill writes all
of his original sayings himself.

791
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,724
All great men do.

792
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:51,682
Beautiful.

793
01:24:00,087 --> 01:24:02,317
Just like day, darling.

794
01:24:06,407 --> 01:24:08,398
What a shot!

795
01:24:08,927 --> 01:24:10,440
He loves it.

796
01:24:13,527 --> 01:24:15,677
It's freezing, come on!

797
01:24:17,807 --> 01:24:19,126
Not yet.

798
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:24,679
OK... now!

799
01:24:29,087 --> 01:24:30,964
Isn't that amazing, my dear?

800
01:24:31,487 --> 01:24:32,681
Yes.

801
01:24:57,687 --> 01:25:00,838
You hit him, Annie.
End it.

802
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:06,445
She got him.
It's part of the act. Everything's OK.

803
01:25:09,567 --> 01:25:11,205
Is this part of the act?

804
01:25:16,767 --> 01:25:18,644
Quick, I'm going to faint.

805
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:31,957
I'm bleeding to death. Don't run.
I got to get out. I'll fall.

806
01:25:41,247 --> 01:25:47,686
The tomahawk they carry
shall rest in the ground

807
01:25:48,487 --> 01:25:56,599
and peace and goodwill
to the nations abound.

808
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:13,837
Presenting Chief Sitting Bull.

809
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:54,965
What's he saying?
I don't know.

810
01:26:55,447 --> 01:26:59,156
I don't understand a word
he's saying. Do you?

811
01:26:59,687 --> 01:27:01,086
But I can guess.

812
01:27:06,007 --> 01:27:07,360
He was joking.

813
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:10,803
He's got a sense of humor.

814
01:27:16,647 --> 01:27:20,322
His way of making the grey mare dance.

815
01:27:51,927 --> 01:27:54,395
To Sitting Bull and his dancing grey.

816
01:27:54,967 --> 01:27:58,164
Or President Cleveland's
closest call!

817
01:28:39,767 --> 01:28:43,157
Now everybody remember
be polite, be brief

818
01:28:43,687 --> 01:28:47,362
and most of all, be yourself.
Remember, it's the President.

819
01:28:51,887 --> 01:28:55,277
This means a lot to the troopers.
It means something to us, too.

820
01:29:11,367 --> 01:29:13,961
How are you?
Did you get hurt today?

821
01:29:14,487 --> 01:29:17,126
No, no, Annie never misses.

822
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:48,236
Frank, where've you been?
I'm pregnant. What?

823
01:29:48,767 --> 01:29:50,041
Pregnant.

824
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:52,725
Congratulations, Mrs. Poole.

825
01:29:55,527 --> 01:30:00,521
I sang it at the Teatro del Roma
in Rome, you know.

826
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:02,844
And I sang...

827
01:30:18,567 --> 01:30:21,559
I never seen
black eyed peas like this.

828
01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:28,081
You were impeccable.
Thank you.

829
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:32,122
Here we go. Champagne
and refreshments for everyone.

830
01:30:32,647 --> 01:30:35,844
Can Nina sing now?
Oh, yes, my rose petal. Go ahead.

831
01:30:36,367 --> 01:30:41,441
Our distinguished and delightful
First Lady has an announcement.

832
01:30:42,887 --> 01:30:44,286
Quiet, please.

833
01:30:46,527 --> 01:30:48,119
For your entertainment

834
01:30:48,647 --> 01:30:52,959
my dear friend
Miss Nina Cavallini will sing...

835
01:30:56,327 --> 01:31:00,036
..."Qui sola vergin rosa"
in Italian.

836
01:34:27,007 --> 01:34:28,042
Brava!

837
01:34:30,367 --> 01:34:36,397
You know, that's the nicest
invitation I ever got. Irresistible.

838
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:40,806
What a cultivated lady she is.
I'm always trying to spread culture.

839
01:34:41,327 --> 01:34:46,355
Why don't you stay for a few days?
I'll show you the real Wild West.

840
01:34:46,887 --> 01:34:48,764
I'd love to

841
01:34:49,887 --> 01:34:55,325
but my secret life with
General Benjamin is wild enough.

842
01:35:08,447 --> 01:35:10,915
Why are you?
Halsey, why's he here?

843
01:35:11,647 --> 01:35:15,083
Great Father is here in answer to
Chief Sitting Bull's dream.

844
01:35:15,607 --> 01:35:17,837
You weren't invited to this party.

845
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:20,406
No more Bull!

846
01:35:20,927 --> 01:35:23,725
You go.
That way.

847
01:35:24,247 --> 01:35:26,442
Let them in, Mr. Gordman.
Goodman.

848
01:35:26,967 --> 01:35:30,960
The chief is a wonderful comedian.
Good to see you.

849
01:35:32,087 --> 01:35:36,444
Great Father, Sitting Bull
has a very simple thing to ask you.

850
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:42,319
Mr. Halsey, I remind you that
in government, nothing is simple.

851
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:48,237
This request will satisfy
Sitting Bull's people forever.

852
01:35:48,767 --> 01:35:53,318
Remember that I'm only "Great Father"
four years at a time.

853
01:35:55,647 --> 01:35:57,842
And another thing
I face a Republican Congress.

854
01:35:58,487 --> 01:36:00,318
I suggest
you deal with your local agent.

855
01:36:00,807 --> 01:36:03,002
We have.
The agents will not help.

856
01:36:04,127 --> 01:36:06,436
Doesn't that indicate
your request is impossible?

857
01:36:06,967 --> 01:36:12,041
This request is simple.
He said nothing is simple.

858
01:36:14,767 --> 01:36:16,485
Sitting Bull's request is simple.

859
01:36:17,607 --> 01:36:20,917
Sitting Bull dreamed he would
meet the Great Father here.

860
01:36:21,447 --> 01:36:23,961
He hoped the Great Father
would honor his request.

861
01:36:24,687 --> 01:36:27,076
I'm sorry
There's nothing I can do.

862
01:36:27,607 --> 01:36:29,916
But you haven't heard
Sitting Bull's request.

863
01:36:30,447 --> 01:36:35,475
But it doesn't make any difference.
It's out of the question.

864
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:42,921
What a confrontation.
Congratulations, Mr. President.

865
01:36:47,767 --> 01:36:50,235
We've had a delightful day with you.

866
01:36:52,047 --> 01:36:53,685
Mr. President

867
01:36:54,207 --> 01:36:57,563
I now see why you're President.
It's uncanny.

868
01:36:58,327 --> 01:37:00,841
The basic, pioneer perception.

869
01:37:02,207 --> 01:37:04,357
The difference between a President

870
01:37:04,887 --> 01:37:07,447
and a chief in a situation like this

871
01:37:08,407 --> 01:37:12,116
is a President knows enough
to retaliate before it's his turn.

872
01:37:13,087 --> 01:37:14,998
Remember that.
I'll use it at the convention.

873
01:37:16,687 --> 01:37:20,760
Well, Mr. President
I know you're tired

874
01:37:21,287 --> 01:37:25,963
and want to hit the hay.
My personal bed is at your disposal.

875
01:37:27,727 --> 01:37:29,763
It's hardly ever been used.

876
01:37:30,607 --> 01:37:33,883
Where will you sleep?
You can sleep with me.

877
01:37:34,407 --> 01:37:38,844
I'll sleep on the prairie
under the moon, listening to

878
01:37:39,367 --> 01:37:41,005
the lullaby of the coyotes.

879
01:37:41,567 --> 01:37:45,560
You see, I ain't
always been a comfortable man.

880
01:37:48,727 --> 01:37:52,925
It's a man like that
that made this country what it is.

881
01:38:22,447 --> 01:38:24,802
Hello there, Dart.
Hello, Mr. Cody.

882
01:38:25,327 --> 01:38:28,637
Is your work done, boy?
Yes sir. Everything's spic and span.

883
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:33,445
That's good. It's a shame the Injuns
can't learn from you coloreds.

884
01:38:33,967 --> 01:38:38,483
But then they'd have nothin' to
fuss about, and they do like to fuss.

885
01:38:41,687 --> 01:38:46,283
I ain't never thanked you for giving
me the opportunity to work for you.

886
01:38:46,807 --> 01:38:51,085
No need. It's part of my upbringing.
I help coloreds when I can.

887
01:38:52,047 --> 01:38:53,844
How's that?

888
01:38:54,367 --> 01:38:58,360
My daddy was killed
trying to keep slavery out of Kansas.

889
01:38:58,887 --> 01:39:01,606
Why'd he do that?
My daddy hated slavery so much

890
01:39:02,127 --> 01:39:06,962
instead of letting 'em become slaves
he fought to keep all coloreds out.

891
01:39:08,087 --> 01:39:09,406
Trying to protect you.

892
01:39:10,847 --> 01:39:13,805
And he caught
a knife in his lungs for the trouble.

893
01:39:14,327 --> 01:39:18,002
You want a drink. I'll buy.
You can sit up front with me.

894
01:39:18,527 --> 01:39:21,724
No, sir. It's already late
and I ain't got no time for that.

895
01:39:22,247 --> 01:39:25,284
I've got to feed your horse.
Thank you for asking.

896
01:39:42,087 --> 01:39:44,726
Where's the Old Bonded, Crutch?
Hello, Mr. Cody.

897
01:39:53,127 --> 01:39:56,403
Well, I'll be damned!
Buffalo Bill himself.

898
01:40:00,887 --> 01:40:04,402
Buy an old friend a drink?
Another glass.

899
01:40:10,287 --> 01:40:12,562
I was beginning
to think you didn't exist.

900
01:40:13,087 --> 01:40:17,922
But here you are in the flesh
and what a sight for sore eyes.

901
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:20,403
You sure passed me by.

902
01:40:20,927 --> 01:40:25,478
Like watching a seed grow into
a tree that's too tall to climb.

903
01:40:26,367 --> 01:40:28,517
You got everything you ever wanted.

904
01:40:29,047 --> 01:40:33,484
You even have the President of the US
sleeping in your bed.

905
01:40:34,007 --> 01:40:36,601
Let's forget that, Ned
and get drunk.

906
01:40:37,127 --> 01:40:40,517
I can't forget it.
Looking at you reminds me of it.

907
01:40:41,047 --> 01:40:44,119
So live it.
Way past the living.

908
01:40:44,647 --> 01:40:47,559
In 100 years
they'll be shouting your name.

909
01:40:48,087 --> 01:40:52,558
You're no longer one of the boys.
You're not like ordinary folk.

910
01:40:53,087 --> 01:40:56,124
It gives me goose bumps
just being this close to you.

911
01:41:00,447 --> 01:41:03,439
You still got the knack
don't you, Ned?

912
01:41:03,967 --> 01:41:08,438
You make it easy, Bill.
You were probably the best ever.

913
01:41:09,887 --> 01:41:12,799
And I'd like to have you
back with the show.

914
01:41:13,807 --> 01:41:18,005
But, frankly, Nate
can't stand the sight of you.

915
01:41:18,527 --> 01:41:21,200
Nostalgia ain't what it used to be.

916
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:24,760
You ain't changed, Bill.

917
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:29,997
I ain't supposed to.
That's why people pay to see me.

918
01:41:30,527 --> 01:41:31,596
Well

919
01:41:33,007 --> 01:41:35,441
This has been a sobering experience.

920
01:41:35,967 --> 01:41:38,242
Damn near a religious awakening.

921
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:44,075
Buffalo Bill...

922
01:41:44,647 --> 01:41:47,002
What a thrill to have invented you.

923
01:41:51,207 --> 01:41:54,438
What do I owe you for my stay?

924
01:41:54,967 --> 01:41:58,118
Nothing, Mr. Buntline.
You don't owe me nothing.

925
01:41:58,647 --> 01:42:01,081
Thanks, Crutch.
'Cause that's what I got.

926
01:42:03,527 --> 01:42:04,403
Nothing.

927
01:42:04,927 --> 01:42:09,523
I'm off to California to preach
against the vultures of Prometheus.

928
01:42:14,767 --> 01:42:15,802
Ned.

929
01:42:24,727 --> 01:42:26,160
See you around.

930
01:42:26,687 --> 01:42:28,359
See you in hell, Bill.

931
01:42:49,727 --> 01:42:53,276
I want to cut the glass blowers.
People really want to see you ride.

932
01:42:53,807 --> 01:42:56,446
When you were in Europe
did you say hi to the Queen for me?

933
01:42:56,967 --> 01:43:00,084
Yes, they're still talking about you.
Can't wait for your return.

934
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:03,997
This'll be our biggest year yet.
We'll gross over 2 million dollars.

935
01:43:04,527 --> 01:43:08,964
I ever tell you I hold the record for
a continuous ride on the Pony Express

936
01:43:09,487 --> 01:43:13,275
322 miles in 18 days.
Oh, I know.

937
01:43:14,607 --> 01:43:18,316
Sit down and have a drink.
Too early for me. You look great.

938
01:43:18,847 --> 01:43:23,125
Yeah, well, I feel great.
Like I could go on forever.

939
01:43:24,967 --> 01:43:28,243
Marty, did I ever tell you that I hold
the Pony Express record

940
01:43:28,767 --> 01:43:34,364
320 and some odd miles
and 18 horses...

941
01:44:13,687 --> 01:44:15,120
Big news.

942
01:44:18,007 --> 01:44:20,043
They've shot Sitting Bull... dead.

943
01:44:20,567 --> 01:44:23,479
I'll be damned.
Oh, my God.

944
01:44:33,887 --> 01:44:36,765
What is it?
Sitting Bull's dead.

945
01:44:47,287 --> 01:44:51,917
McLaughlin's police, at standing rock.
They say he was trying to escape.

946
01:44:59,127 --> 01:45:02,005
He was riding the grey
that Bill gave him.

947
01:45:02,527 --> 01:45:05,485
The horse danced
when they shot the chief.

948
01:45:11,007 --> 01:45:15,319
Who's going to tell Bill? Nobody.
Mo point bothering him with that.

949
01:45:56,207 --> 01:45:58,084
I don't dream.

950
01:45:59,887 --> 01:46:01,878
Must be somebody out...

951
01:46:04,047 --> 01:46:05,526
I'm not alone.

952
01:46:17,127 --> 01:46:19,880
Oh no, don't buckle.
He ain't really there.

953
01:46:28,607 --> 01:46:30,916
I hate women. I hate them!

954
01:46:33,687 --> 01:46:35,643
Cost me a lot of wampum.

955
01:47:06,927 --> 01:47:09,077
Alright, suit yourself.

956
01:47:26,407 --> 01:47:28,762
You ain't even the right image.

957
01:47:30,567 --> 01:47:32,603
Halsey, get out here.

958
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:37,444
Tell the chief you've got
all the brains. I'll tell him.

959
01:47:37,967 --> 01:47:41,642
Chief!
Halsey's got all the brains.

960
01:47:43,927 --> 01:47:47,715
Ex cept Halsey
he doesn't mean a word he says.

961
01:47:48,687 --> 01:47:50,484
Which is why he sounds so real.

962
01:47:52,927 --> 01:47:53,803
Real...

963
01:47:54,887 --> 01:47:58,084
Let me show you something about real.

964
01:48:04,127 --> 01:48:07,324
I was a boy.
I was eleven years...

965
01:48:11,527 --> 01:48:12,516
Nine.

966
01:48:13,327 --> 01:48:14,680
I was nine.

967
01:48:15,567 --> 01:48:17,046
I caught this big buff

968
01:48:17,647 --> 01:48:19,205
right smack in the middle.

969
01:48:47,887 --> 01:48:50,037
God meant for me to be white.

970
01:48:55,727 --> 01:48:57,479
God meant for me to be white.

971
01:48:58,007 --> 01:48:59,565
And it ain't easy.

972
01:49:00,087 --> 01:49:02,806
I got people with no lives

973
01:49:04,527 --> 01:49:08,076
living through me. Proud people.
People to worry about.

974
01:49:10,887 --> 01:49:12,559
And another thing.

975
01:49:13,087 --> 01:49:17,842
My daddy died without seeing me
as... as a star.

976
01:49:19,407 --> 01:49:21,637
Profitable, good looking.

977
01:49:22,567 --> 01:49:24,125
Custer was a star.

978
01:49:24,647 --> 01:49:26,478
He was a good man.

979
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:28,926
He gave coffee and sugar.

980
01:49:29,447 --> 01:49:32,007
Don't.
He was a good man.

981
01:49:32,527 --> 01:49:36,042
He gave the Indians
reason to be famous.

982
01:49:42,527 --> 01:49:44,324
Damn you!

983
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:50,560
In 100 years...

984
01:49:53,607 --> 01:49:56,883
...I'll still be
Buffalo Bill... star!

985
01:49:57,407 --> 01:49:59,284
And you'll be the Injun.

986
01:50:02,367 --> 01:50:05,518
My God, look at you.
Look at you.

987
01:50:07,887 --> 01:50:10,003
You want to stay the same.

988
01:50:11,087 --> 01:50:13,282
Well, that's going backwards.

989
01:50:16,807 --> 01:50:20,243
Buntline...
Oh, damn you, you deserter.

990
01:50:33,567 --> 01:50:35,717
I'm curious, Chief.

991
01:50:36,967 --> 01:50:39,959
My friends are curious.
My women are curious.

992
01:50:40,487 --> 01:50:42,603
My fans are curious.

993
01:50:43,127 --> 01:50:45,357
And they pay me for it.

994
01:50:45,887 --> 01:50:47,843
I give them what they expect.

995
01:50:48,367 --> 01:50:51,165
You can't live up to what you expect.

996
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:53,917
That makes you
more make believe than me.

997
01:50:54,447 --> 01:50:56,915
You don't even know
if you're bluffing.

998
01:51:01,287 --> 01:51:02,959
The difference

999
01:51:03,487 --> 01:51:07,526
between a white man
and an Injun, in ALL situations

1000
01:51:08,047 --> 01:51:10,322
is that an Injun is red.

1001
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:15,679
And an Injun is red
for a real good reason.

1002
01:51:17,007 --> 01:51:19,475
To tell us apart.

1003
01:51:25,407 --> 01:51:27,762
So we can tell us apart.

1004
01:51:29,887 --> 01:51:31,559
My God

1005
01:51:32,087 --> 01:51:34,317
ain't he riding that horse right?

1006
01:51:35,567 --> 01:51:37,285
If he ain't...

1007
01:51:40,847 --> 01:51:43,122
then how come
all of you took him for a king?

1008
01:51:54,087 --> 01:51:55,281
