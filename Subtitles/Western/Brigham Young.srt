All right.
Go ahead.

168
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:11,620
Gentlemen, it looks to me like there's
been a little mistake made here.

169
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,364
The lawyer for the other side
has been so busy...

170
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:21,202
trying to pin every crime
on the calendar on Joseph Smith...

171
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:25,074
he clean forgot to mention
that us folks was the victims
of all those outrages...

172
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:29,547
he was talking about,
not the ones that were doing them.

173
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:34,746
Sure, we finally got around
trying to protect ourselves.

174
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,415
You push even a coyote up in a corner,
and he'll snap back at you.

175
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:41,585
<i>That's the first time</i>
<i>I ever heard it called treason though.</i>

176
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:45,358
in other words,
the whole point is...

177
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:50,266
whetherJoseph Smith or
any other American citizen...

178
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:53,100
has a right to worship God
as he chooses.

179
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:58,771
So that's why i figured
i'd like to tell you
a little bit aboutJoseph Smith.

180
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:01,745
<i>Now, me,</i>
<i>I'm just an ordinary everyday fellow.</i>

181
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:05,113
i used to farm a little,
do a little carpentry work...

182
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,448
painting-- anything
to make a living.

183
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,980
But all that time, i was trying
to find the right church...

184
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:15,118
for me and for my family, and i was
willing to give them all a try.

185
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:17,128
But somehow none of them
hit me just right.

186
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:21,462
i'm not saying, gentlemen,
there was anything wrong
with them for other people.

187
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:24,025
i'm just saying
they didn't suit me.

188
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,064
One day i picked up
The Book of Mormon...

189
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,268
<i>and I said to my friend</i>
<i>Heber Kimball...</i>

190
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:34,074
''Heber, let's go out to Ohio
and see this prophet.

191
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:37,604
Let's see what he's got
to say for himself.''

192
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:42,313
i remember it was about noon
we came up toJoseph Smith's house...

193
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,056
and his wife Emma
came to the door.

194
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:44,385
and his wife Emma
came to the door.

195
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:46,925
Excuse me, ma'am, is this
whereJoseph Smith lives?

196
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,962
- Yes.
- We'd like to talk to him, please.

197
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:53,590
You'll find him out yonder,
the other side of the lake,
chopping wood.

198
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,657
Thank you, ma'am.

199
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:01,562
That sounds kind of funny
for a prophet to be out swinging an ax.

200
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,508
- Don't seem just right.
- Prophet ought to act like a prophet.

201
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:07,671
Can't expect to build a church
if he acts like a farmhand.

202

205

- This is my friend Heber Kimball.
- i'm glad to meet you.

206
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:32,396
We've come
a long ways to see you.

207
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:34,632
We want to ask you some questions
about your church.

208
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:38,370
Gladly. i'd like to tell you about it.
Won't you sit down?

209
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:48,748
What's this about you folks
calling yourselves saints?

210
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:51,312
Well, we believe
that any man, dead or alive...

211
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,381
who keeps
the Ten Commandments is a saint.

212
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,825
You don't pretend to be
the Lord himself, do you?

213
00:16:55,895 --> 00:17:00,525
No. i'm just a mortal man,
same as you or your friend here.

214
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:04,467
Well, this plan of yours
you call the United Order,
what's that?

215
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:07,233
it's not my plan.
it's the Lord's.

216

Well, whose ever it is,
what is it?

217
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:15,743
Well, i-- i suppose
you'd call it the law of nature.

218
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:20,616
You see, it's his idea
that the land of Zion will
be sort of like a beehive...

219
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,881

over there...

<i>the old folks.</i>

226
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:42,334
You see, under
a brotherhood plan like that...

227
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,639
it'll be impossible for any one man
to pile up a lot of goods...

228
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,145
or have power
over his neighbors.

229
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,842
That'll mean there'll be
no social distinctions...

230
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,818

no special privileges.

231
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:58,880

there is in that anthill over there.

232
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,984

we've all but lost it.

i'm not asking you to believe...

247
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,740
a single thing
Joseph Smith said...

248
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,268
but i do ask you--
let him believe it.

249
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,644
Let me believe it
if we want to.

250
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:01,219
Your forefathers and mine
came to this country
in the first place...

251
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:05,951
for one great reason--
to escape persecution
for their beliefs...

252
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:11,622
and to build a free country
where everybody might
worship God as he pleased.

253
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:14,757
That's what brought
the Puritans to Massachusetts...

254
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,995
the Quakers
to Pennsylvania...

255
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:21,369
the Huguenots to South Carolina,
the Catholics to Maryland.

256
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,307
And when they found
what they were after...

257
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:27,834
they fought a great war
to hold on to it...

258
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:31,280
and they drew up one
of the noblest documents ever written--

259
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,980
the Constitution
of the United States--
to govern free men.

260
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:39,491

they put on that piece of paper...

261
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:42,721

262
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,990
the right to worship God
as he pleases...

263
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:49,967

264

- Like Brigham stood up
for him in court you mean?

He'd never have been in court

listened to fool advice.

00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:34,267
All they need
is a little bucking up...

642
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:38,001
and a kick in the right direction so's--
so's they'll know their own strength.

643
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:41,738
And then you'll see how soon
they'll stop all this infernal whining...

644
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:45,976
and all this talk about running off,
quitting the church.

645
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:48,074
First thing you know,
they'll be letting their beards grow.

646
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:50,518
<i>They'll be getting dirt</i>
<i>under their fingernails...</i>

647
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:53,454
<i>and calluses on their hands</i>
<i>as big as hoecakes.</i>

648
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:55,515
<i>And they'll be ready to whip</i>
<i>the tar out of the first fellow...</i>

649
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:58,220
that says
we'll never make it.

650

if there's anybody here
doubts that, they'd better
haul tail right now...

651
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:03,290
because we don't want 'em.

652
00:52:05,235 --> 00:52:08,636
We'll build our wagons,
and we'll scratch for our food.

653
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:11,765
We'll shiver, and we'll
go hungry if we have to.

654
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:14,811
And maybe some of us
will keel over and die in our tracks...

655
00:52:14,878 --> 00:52:16,869
but that won't
stop us neither.

656
00:52:16,947 --> 00:52:19,609
Because the rest of us
will keep going,
and we'll never stop.

657
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:23,050
Never, not until
we've found the place.

<i>they keep comin'</i>

660
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:36,561
<i>I doubt if there's been</i>
<i>anything to equal this...</i>

661
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:38,760
<i>since the children of Israel</i>
<i>set out across the Red Sea...</i>

662
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:42,397

<i>you had to open up the waters</i>

663
00:52:42,473 --> 00:52:44,998
<i>And talk about miracles.</i>

664
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:49,068
<i>Just take a look at the way</i>
<i>some of these wagons</i>
<i>have hung together.</i>

665
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:53,981
<i>Of course, it took</i>
<i>plenty of scurrying around</i>
<i>to get together what we did.</i>

666
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:58,147
<i>But I knew that as soon</i>
<i>as we stopped arguin'..</i>

<i>and grumblin'about</i>
<i>what had to be done...</i>

668

- We should've built
arks instead of wagons.

clear to the Rocky Mountains.

Thank you,Jonathan.

Four or five months,

to ask you to go.

You've got a family
to look after.

who can go in your place.

Don't you care what
anybody else thinks or feels?

1132

- He's head of the church.
- Even if he is, he isn't God.

1133
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:08,750
- He can't run everything.
- He'll look after you
and the children.

and i'm not worrying about me.

- What i was gonna talk about...

a revelation.

Well, you might
call it that.

1145

We ought
to get married right away.

- Well, in the spring...

1148
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:16,251
Well, i don't see any sense
in puttin' it off any longer than that.

1149
01:30:16,324 --> 01:30:19,122
Oh, but your Brigham Young'll
want you to marry a Mormon girl,
won't he?

1150
01:30:19,194 --> 01:30:21,128
- Several of them.
- Several?

1151
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:24,165
if you're gonna be rich,
you'll have to have
a lot of wives, won't you?

1152
01:30:24,232 --> 01:30:28,032
i've been wonderin' how you're
gonna go about askin' 'em--
one at a time or all together.

1153
01:30:28,103 --> 01:30:31,504
Maybe it would be easier if you said,
''Sisters, will you kindly marry me?''

1154
01:30:31,573 --> 01:30:34,633
- Zina!
- Then after you've married
20 or 30 of them...

one more than
all the rest put together?

the same socks and cooking

my question yet
about our being married.

Oh, well, it--

Well, figure it out
for yourself.

1164
01:31:20,255 --> 01:31:22,314
Say every man's
got 20 wives.

1165

- There aren't that many women.
- Oh, we can get 'em.

1166
01:31:24,425 --> 01:31:27,588
Women convert easy. And say
every wife's got ten children.

1167
01:31:27,662 --> 01:31:29,596
That's 200 children apiece.

1168
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,189
And say every one
of those 200's got 20 wives.

1169
01:31:32,267 --> 01:31:35,259
That's 4,000. And say
they got ten children apiece.

1170
01:31:35,336 --> 01:31:37,804
So that'll give you
40,000 grandchildren.
