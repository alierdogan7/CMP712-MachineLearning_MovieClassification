Szaki

3
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,211
Mary.

4
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,012
Mary.

5
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,137
Forgive my countrymen.

6
00:02:01,636 --> 00:02:03,867
They did not want you here.
They are scared.

7
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:05,080
Scared?

8
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,680
Of what I saw on the farm.

9
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,119
The family, the Ryans.

10
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:11,139
All dead.

11
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:26,860
Take your time,
we only got all night.

12
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,270
Night's gone.

13
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,440
Sun's up.

14
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,791
I'll see you ten guineas.

15
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:38,360
And... I'll raise ya.

16
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:40,039
All in.

17
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:56,600
I really respect a man
that underestimates his opponent.

18
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:05,960
One bullet.

19
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:07,677
Two bullet.

20
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:09,480
Three bullets.

21
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,240
Four bullets.

22
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
Right between the cheeks.

23
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,240
Stay easy on that trigger.

24
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:33,046
Lucky boy.

25
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:36,840
It's not luck.
It's skill and good breeding.

26
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:40,997
- You mind if I join your game?
- You can take my seat, friend.

27
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:46,191
As much as I have enjoyed
this sparkling wit and hospitality,

28
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,839
I'm in need of a hot bath.

29
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,157
And the patronage
of a beautiful woman.

30
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,572
Lucky for me...

31
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:53,842
I can afford both.

32
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,044
But it would be very rude of me

33
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,849
not to allow you the chance
to recoup some of your coin.

34
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,650
Drink.

35
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:19,352
Drink.

36
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,520
- It will help with the pain.
- What pain?

37
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,746
I really must be going now,
because that bath's screaming at me.

38
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:39,343
You gave Mulligan a chance
to win back some coin.

39
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,339
What about me?

40
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:44,540
Had something to wager.

41
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,710
It looks to me like you've got...

42
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,124
nothing left of value.

43
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,160
My boots.

44
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,951
I've got boots.

45
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:56,920
We'll make this easy.

46
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,680
What do you say highest card wins?

47
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,240
Very hard to beat.

48
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,939
Would you look at that?

49
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,840
- They're a perfect fit.
- Will you be wanting your old boots?

50
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:48,442
Have em.
You know what?

51
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,840
In the spirit
of Christian generosity.

52
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,489
You kidding me!

53
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:55,811
Pleasure.

54
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,166
Here's for skill.

55
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,610
Here is for your good breeding.

56
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:15,193
Come on, let's get him up there.

57
00:06:16,164 --> 00:06:17,460
A month's wages.

58
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:21,984
- String him up.
- See we usually

59
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,081
drown card cheats in this town.

60
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,207
- You're too good for drowning.
- You realise that the Queen's law

61
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:30,640
prohibits hanging without a trial?

62
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm the only law here in Stanley.

63
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,000
Ballarat diggings.
Leaving in five minutes.

64
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,005
Single passage, please.

65
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,943
Four pound six.

66
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:50,682
Good day, gents.
Four pound six.

67
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,683
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it!

68
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:01,684
Alright fellas.

69
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,547
More than happy to divvy up
my winnings to the four of us.

70
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,697
The only thing
we'll be divvying up, mate...

71
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,636
are the gold fillings in your teeth.

72
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:13,400
- Excuse me.
- Farrier.

73
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
So good to see you.

74
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,960
- What do you want?
- What's he done?

75
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,960
It's a misunderstanding.
You tell him, Conrad.

76
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,545
I don't cheat at cards.

77
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,494
- You're a mate of his?
- Kind of.

78
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,635
Tell him he's got me pegged all wrong.
I'm really a great guy when you get to know me.

79
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,760
- How much to let him go?
- How much you got?

80
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,760
Bank of England, eh?

81
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:36,360
There's the right of exchange.

82
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:37,840
Any gold?

83
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:40,640
Now is not the time

84
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,320
to be cheap.

85
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,121
OK, ok, ok!

86
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,931
If I see you in Stanley again,

87
00:07:57,254 --> 00:08:00,420
it's gonna take more than a bag of gold
to save your miserable ass.

88
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,280
You alright?

89
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:06,020
I just caught my breath.

90
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,921
Oh no! No, no, no!
Wait!

91
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:14,014
Wait.
Stop, hold up!

92
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,520
He's got my gear.

93
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,624
You can always buy another ticket.

94
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:21,900
With what?

95
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,420
I just gave that bloke him all my coin
to save you from the rope.

96
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,740
And I will pay you back every bob,
tenner, penny, and sprat.

97
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,957
I swear on my dear mother's life.

98
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:34,884
To be alive, Conrad.

99
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:37,185
Jack.

100
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:39,886
Jack.

101
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,387
Jack.

102
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:48,588
- Am I dreaming?
- No, Jack.

103
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,689
It is me, Mary.

104
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,128
Am I dreaming?

105
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:04,506
Giving all the opium
these Chinese diggers stuffed you in.

106
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:05,434
Maybe.

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,092
Li Ping fetched me.

108
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,291
Relax.

109
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,199
No one knows you're here.

110
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,765
Besides, Fuller and his traps
are out at the Ryans farm.

111
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,640
I got to get out of here.

112
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,700
- You need to rest up.
- Gotta find Dan.

113
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,488
Knowing Dan,
he is drunk in some brothel...

114
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:32,520
Or out brawling,
or brawling drunk in a brothel.

115
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,280
I can't just leave.

116
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:35,906
What else are you going to do?

117
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,608
I gotta find who murdered the Ryans
and who shot me.

118
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:40,640
You just get well.

119
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:44,525
Let Superintendent Fuller worry
about justice for the Ryans, okay?

120
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,167
Looks like the family was shot
before the house was torched.

121
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:00,732
Bushrangers.

122
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,027
Bushrangers rob banks.
Stick up travellers on the road.

123
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:07,799
Don't murder families in cold blood.

124
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,200
Expert are you Scanlon, in the depraved
workings of the bushranger's brain.

125
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,435
- No, sir.
- Don't undersell yourself.

126
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:17,680
- You used to be a thieving scum.
- I was never a bushranger.

127
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,914
I just don't think bushrangers did this,
that's all I'm saying.

128
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,801
Recognise this?

129
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:50,640
Afternoon, Fredrick.

130
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:51,641
Catherine

131
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,200
I brought you something
for the school.

132
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,000
I cut em from the stone meself.

133
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,200
That's very charitable of you.
God knows we're stretched for funds  here.

134
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:07,640
Possum.

135
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,920
To teach the kids about the bush.

136
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:13,320
I was going to bring you
a wild pig...

137
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:17,116
I didn't managed to catch
the stupid little bugger yet.

138
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,497
Pigs are much smarter than possums.

139
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,421
Thank you.

140
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,840
Was there something else?

141
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,211
No.
Uh, yes...

142
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:30,120
I was wondering if...

143
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:31,720
one evening,

144
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,900
we might...

145
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,118
Wonder what's got them in a hurry.

146
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,715
Haven't you heard?

147
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,960
What's going on?

148
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,828
You can't just come in here
and tear my place apart.

149
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,198
Yes, I can.

150
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:52,105
If I suspect you of harbouring
a bushranger.

151
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:53,920
Sir.

152
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:58,905
Tommy, come on, let's go.

153
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:10,320
Hello, Superintendent.

154
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,080
A bit early in the day for it...

155
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,164
- Idiot.
- Money upfront.

156
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,498
- Everything's okay.
- You people think you know Jack Keenan.

157
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,160
You think he's a good man.

158
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,977
It'd change your tune if you saw
what he did at the Ryans' farm.

159
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:26,762
A whole family, butchered.

160
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:28,724
Jack wouldn't have done that.

161
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:32,533
I'm told you're a smart woman,
Mary Barrett.

162
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:36,213
No small achievement to have bought
that life for you and your boy.

163
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,440
So why risk everything for him?

164
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,101
Because if I can prove
you're a sympathiser of the bushrangers,

165
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:43,640
I would drag you out of here
by your hair in front of your son.

166
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,110
And throw you in prison
with the rest of the criminals.

167
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:48,040
I've got work to do.

168
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,980
Watch the bar.

169
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:20,170
- I didn't kill that family.
- Just keep applying your ointment.

170
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:23,717
Might stink to high heaven but Li Ping
knows what he's talking about.

171
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,528
Leg of mutton.

172
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:29,394
Go!

173
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:02,795
Hey.

174
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,619
- What happened to you?
- I got shot.

175
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

176
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:12,862
You had it easy.
Wait till you hear about my day.

177
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,267
- What's he doing here?
- It's a long story, but it ends

178
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:21,080
with us both loosing all our cash
and having to steal a couple of nags.

179
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,304
Now I am a horse thief.

180
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:26,062
You can always
look on the bright side, farrier.

181
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:29,026
- Things can't get much worse.
- Actually they can.

182
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,720
We're wanted for murder.

183
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:34,320
Murder?

184
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:36,510
Who have you killed?

185
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:38,047
The Ryans.

186
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:40,564
Shawn Ryan?

187
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,116
- Wife.
- Son.

188
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:44,880
Very pretty daughter.

189
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:50,200
- What are we going to do about it?
- Nothing tonight. I'm starved.

190
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,866
- Can't believe you got shot.
- Can't believe you lost all your money.

191
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:59,240
I can't believe
I'm wanted for murder.

192
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,751
What's going on?

193
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,120
Where do you come from?

194
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,840
Get to the horses.

195
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,741
Get them!

196
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,945
Keep up, farrier.

197
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,100
Faster, we're losing them.

198
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:40,027
Tracker.

199
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:41,866
Charlie.

200
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:54,694
That way. One of them's
lopsided in the saddle, boss.

201
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:56,642
I'd say he's wounded.

202
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,994
- How far down the stream we need to go?
- They got a tracker.

203
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:14,980
Those fellas, They'll read the ground
like a storybook.

204
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,738
- Tell you what you had for suppe last night.
- Name of the women you last slept with.

205
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,915
- Even how many children you'll father.
- All by the shape of the hoof.

206
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:24,440
Water's the only thing
that can throw a tracker them off the scent.

207
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,720
- We're leaving then.
- About here, I reckon.

208
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:43,497
Anything?

209
00:17:45,762 --> 00:17:48,102
Boss?
I'll get the money, ain't I?

210
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,838
You'll get your money
when you finish the job.

211
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:54,461
- I've heard that before.
- Not from me, you haven't.

212
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,528
They came out here.
Heading for the drop.

213
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,360
Stay on that ridge.

214
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:05,741
Down there?

215
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
That's a dead man's drop.
Too stiff to climb.

216
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,760
- How steep?
- What don't you understand?

217
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,871
I think They found us.

218
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,312
You got any prayers,
you'd better start saying them.

219
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:18,515
Okay, Ma.
Looks like your oldest son's coming on.

220
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:20,980
Your mother's She's dead?
You swore on her life you'd pay me back.

221
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:23,598
- You won't need money in Heaven.
- Alright, boys.

222
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:52,799
Damn it!

223
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:04,382
You can't let the traps shoot him.

224
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:06,804
- Who?
- Conrad, the farrier.

225
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:09,560
- The horse thief.
- He is not a horse thief.

226
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,080
Fuller invented the charges
so that he could arrest him.

227
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
- And what do you care?
- I love him.

228
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,482
- He's the man I'm going to marry.
- You'll marry who I tell you to.

229
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:21,060
And I tell you now it won't be some
horse thieving farrier called Conrad.

230
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,161
Emilia!

231
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:24,751
I'll stop him myself.

232
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,280
Stay still, little piggy.

233
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,520
It's alright, miss.

234
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,701
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

235
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,059
Where's my horse?

236
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:09,880
Got scared, he bolted.

237
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,440
I gotta go.
They're gonna shoot Conrad.

238
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:13,637
The farrier?

239
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:18,200
You got a nasty habit
of greeting your mates like that.

240
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,952
What are you doing here?

241
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,253
Conrad!

242
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:28,640
- I thought you were going to the diggings in Ballarat. - Someone liked to join ahead?

243
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,409
There's a time and a place for that,
and this is neither.

244
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,710
Jack!

245
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:38,362
The traps were following us.

246
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:40,956
But we covered our tracks,
we laid down some false markings.

247
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:43,480
It'd be next to impossible
for anyone to track us here.

248
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:44,969
Keenan!

249
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:47,463
Is that right, Jack?

250
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:50,800
Surrender.

251
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,663
We have you surrounded.

252
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:54,800
- If we come out, you'll shoot us.
- Possible.

253
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,224
But it'll be no more than you deserve
after what you did to that family.

254
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,090
It'll be a waste of breath
telling you we'd nothing to do with it.

255
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,560
You can waste your breath,

256
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,560
if you come out
with your hands on your head.

257
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,640
I promise you a fair trial.

258
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,641
Damn fair for us hanging.

259
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,000
You boys have two minutes.

260
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,560
Then we're coming in.

261
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,760
Hurry up.

262
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,720
- Who owns this hut, Sergeant?
- I don't know, sir.

263
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,960
Any ideas?

264
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:27,261
Yeah.

265
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,526
We keep her hostage.
And we use her to bargain our way out.

266
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,087
Try and you'll have to deal with me.

267
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,080
- You got to get out of here.
- I'm not leaving you.

268
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:39,710
- You gotta go while it's safe.
- This is safe.

269
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,200
I'd rather die here with you.

270
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:44,229
Oh, please.

271
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:47,088
Even if somehow we get out of here,
that tracker will find us.

272
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,545
And Fuller won't stop
until he shoots us all in the back.

273
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,387
Great. We'll just kill ourselves now
and get it over with.

274
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,244
That's the best idea yet.

275
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:56,720
- I was kinda joking.
- I don't know.

276
00:21:57,189 --> 00:22:00,560
I got heaps of gunpowder
and a new thing called glycerine.

277
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:03,640
I say we blow ourselves
to kingdom come.

278
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:09,080
Time's up, Keenan.

279
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,544
Sergeant.
On my mark.

280
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,080
Let's torn the hut.

281
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,627
Wait!
Please.

282
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,560
You can't fire.

283
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:19,861
Emilie?

284
00:22:19,953 --> 00:22:21,160
They're innocent.

285
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:24,318
You can't shoot them.

286
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:27,077
They're innocent.
All of them.

287
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:29,800
They've got barrels of gunpowder.

288
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:32,840
If you shoot,
the whole hut will explode.

289
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,160
- Fire!
- No!

290
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:17,726
Hey, boss.

291
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,176
Guess I'll be getting my money now?

292
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:25,100
Have some respect for the dead, Charlie.

293
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,120
Successful outcome.

294
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:31,094
Reckon you got them good, boss.

295
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,004
That's a job well done, men.

296
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:08,505
Tom!

297
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,427
Take this upstairs to the girls
to wash their head.

298
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:12,328
OK.

299
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,529
Mary.

300
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:26,840
Drink?

301
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:28,860
- No.
- It's a pub, Mick.

302
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:31,827
The only reason coming here
is for the grog.

303
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:32,920
I'm on duty.

304
00:24:39,852 --> 00:24:41,100
He's dead.

305
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:45,680
They're all dead.

306
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:54,920
I make a decent living.

307
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,377
Honest one.

308
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,600
Solid and stable.

309
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:02,840
I'd make a good father for Tommy...

310
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,613
A husband for you.

311
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,128
I'll make sure
Fuller gets you no grief.

312
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,756
You hear.

313
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,676
I just want to put that on the table.

314
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,326
If you would think about.

315
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,484
He didn't kill that family.

316
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:30,740
Jack was shot
by whoever killed the Ryans.

317
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:33,280
The Chinese pulled the bullet
from his ribs.

318
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:35,265
You know Jack.

319
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,859
There's no way
he could have done such a thing.

320
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,720
The Jack I knew
always put himself first.

321
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,902
He's capable of doing a lot of things
as long as it suited Jack.

322
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:51,002
You deserve better.

323
00:25:58,532 --> 00:26:00,150
- Won't you freak.
- Alright.

324
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Watch it.

325
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:13,419
You call that a tunnel?

326
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:15,760
Heritage wombat.

327
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:18,208
Kept digging underneath
to keep food safe.

328
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,878
It should be wild spuds?

329
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:22,317
Hid a pretty bugged stuff, too.

330
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,160
- How does it feel to be dead?
- No money.

331
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,800
No horses, no prospects.

332
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,554
We might as well be dead.

333
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:36,520
Come out of the ground
like newborn babies.

334
00:26:37,057 --> 00:26:38,920
New life means new opportunity.

335
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:41,885
- We get to start afresh.
- Alright, fellas.

336
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,035
Looks like we walk.
Dan, pick a direction.

337
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:47,015
Nearest hot bath.

338
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:49,464
That way.

339
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,165
- Mary!
- Emilia!

340
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,410
I've got a message for you.

341
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:09,831
From Jack.

342
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,814
He's not dead.

343
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:18,160
Jack asked me to tell you
that he plans to claim some land

344
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:21,280
and start a farm, and once he's up
and running, he'll get word to you.

345
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:24,160
To do what?

346
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,460
You'll get word to me to do what?

347
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:28,960
To be with him.

348
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,055
- To be together, the two of you.
- Is he serious?

349
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:34,060
I've three businesses to run.

350
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:36,851
What is he expecting me to do?
Sell up and walk away?

351
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:38,657
The arrogance of the man.

352
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:40,636
Typical ruddy Jack.

353
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:53,759
Can't even go back to Hopetoun.

354
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:56,665
I'll have to leave the district.

355
00:27:57,337 --> 00:27:59,280
- Keep a low profile.
- Change our names.

356
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:02,789
You know how long it took me
to come up with the name Captain Gunpowder?

357
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,760
How about Captain Cook?

358
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,923
- What?
- Fellas.

359
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,127
This guy has horses.

360
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:18,828
Hi there!

361
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,120
- See you found our horses?
- My horses.

362
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:24,520
Wait a minute.

363
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,739
The thing is we had a little incident

364
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:31,240
which caused our horses to do a bunk,
so we'd be grateful...

365
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,714
They're mine.

366
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:40,560
What do we say we have a fresh start?

367
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:41,861
Hang us.

368
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:43,551
How much for one?

369
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:45,856
Ten guineas.

370
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,400
Just the one?

371
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:01,800
That sounds like you got more than}enough in there
to cover all of us here.

372
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:03,832
I just blew up my home.

373
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:06,060
Everything in it to save your bacon.

374
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,148
You think I'm gonna buy you horses?

375
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,080
He just bought my horse.

376
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:17,760
Maybe we can come to some other arrangement,
we take the horses now,

377
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,640
and pay you later
at an inflated price, of course.

378
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:22,920
What you got to trade?

379
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:24,996
Trade?

380
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:28,760
Just the clothes on our backs.

381
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,940
I need boots.

382
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:36,960
- The boots are all yours, my friend.
- Not your dirty old boots.

383
00:29:37,786 --> 00:29:38,800
His boots.

384
00:29:41,498 --> 00:29:43,053
Dan, give me your boots.

385
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:46,360
I love these boots.

386
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:49,108
These are the comfiest boots
I've ever had.

387
00:29:49,228 --> 00:29:51,589
They've got sentimental value,
I won't give them.

388
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:53,756
Give the man your boots.

389
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,538
Here you go, take the boots.

390
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,861
Where did you get these?

391
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,767
I won them in a card game.
Fair and square.

392
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:15,375
"Fair and square."

393
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:17,422
What card game?
When was it?

394
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:20,080
A couple of days ago.
A pub in Stanley.

395
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,708
- Who do they belong to?
- I don't know, some bloke.

396
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:25,714
You should have seen him.
He comes in, sticks his stack of gold.

397
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,200
Stack of gold.

398
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:28,980
My gold.
Give me that.

399
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:32,680
- Where do you go?
- To Stanley.

400
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,578
Come on.

401
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,499
Jack!

402
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,091
Who owns these?

403
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:01,120
Take a good look.

404
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,080
Someone must know
who owns these boots.

405
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:05,261
Reckon I know.

406
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,496
What will it be worth to you?

407
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:11,272
Why don't we start
with half an ounce of lead.

408
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:16,160
Bloke's name's...

409
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:18,680
- John Grady.
- Where do I find him?

410
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:21,160
Tent city.

411
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,080
He's holed up there with his...

412
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:24,748
Chinese woman.

413
00:31:32,097 --> 00:31:33,147
John Grady.

414
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
Looking for John Grady.
Can anyone tell me where he is?

415
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,960
Anyone tell me where John Grady is?

416
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:49,560
- John Grady?
- Who's asking?

417
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:51,555
Can't you see I'm busy?

418
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:55,480
What are you doing?

419
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:57,960
Why did you do it?
You didn't have to shoot them.

420
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Why?

421
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:00,121
Jack!
Jack!

422
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:03,040
What are you doing?
That's the dog who shot the Ryans.

423
00:32:05,037 --> 00:32:07,140
That is not the dog
that owns those boots.

424
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,660
It's not him.

425
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:12,290
It's not him.

426
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:22,200
Why did you tell me those boots
were Grady's?

427
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:24,038
I didn't not say that.

428
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:24,839
Jack!
Jack. Jack.

429
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:26,169
Allow me. Allow me.

430
00:32:28,103 --> 00:32:30,542
- Where is my money?
- This isn't about your money.

431
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:33,640
I'll ask you one last time.

432
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:35,840
Why did you lie about those boots?

433
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:38,240
- I was doing you a favour.
- How?

434
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,420
By getting me to kill some bloke a guy you
don't like or whose woman you want?

435
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:44,080
Alright.
The boots belong to Joey Butler.

436
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:49,397
- But you don't wanna mess with Joey.
- Where is he?

437
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:50,938
Where is he?

438
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:53,480
Joey likes to punt.

439
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,991
You'll find him down the road.

440
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:03,800
I want my boots back.

441
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,139
What are you doing?

442
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,248
- You gonna kill him?
- Yeah, probably.

443
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:17,571
No other way to deal with this guy?

444
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:19,865
Not unless
you breathe life back into the Ryans.

445
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:23,452
Every troop of this side of Sydney
will be looking for us if we just stop and}kill him.

446
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:27,718
- Stop and think about it.
- There's nothing to think about.

447
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:29,145
What's this about?

448
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:33,334
Is this about you getting justice for the Ryans
or is this just about you getting even?

449
00:33:35,136 --> 00:33:36,462
Get out of my way.

450
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,656
Which one is he?
Can you see him?

451
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,560
Which one is he?

452
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,920
What odds will you give me
on the bold guy?

453
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,124
Looking pretty pink for a dead white.

454
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:15,639
- How did you find us?
- You kidding? You boys stink.

455
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:17,959
Didn't fool me
with that dead pig either.

456
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,920
That white fella fell for that much.

457
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,282
- What are you saying?
- I'm open to a deal.

458
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:24,240
- What do you want?
- What do you got?

459
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:33,079
How about that?

460
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,880
It's a start.
What else you got?

461
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,052
I won.

462
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:42,845
Pleasure doing business.

463
00:34:51,046 --> 00:34:52,246
Well?

464
00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:55,241
Joey Butler disappeared
and no one's saying a word.

465
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,080
No say nothing.

466
00:34:57,823 --> 00:35:00,298
I told Gunpowder and Conrad
we'll meet them at Peaches Creek.

467
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:01,910
We'll ride west together.

468
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:06,080
Come on.
Let this one go.

469
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:12,360
Fresh start, remember?
Come on.

470
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,390
New beginning.

471
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:24,860
"In the beginning was the word.

472
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:29,720
"And the word

473
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,185
"was with God."

474
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,156
Copy the phrase on your new slates.

475
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:59,090
- You weren't seen, were you, kid?
- No, but we shouldn't be here.

476
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,702
Jack said...

477
00:36:00,822 --> 00:36:03,994
Keep our heads down, and he goes
riding off to Stanley like a bull in a gate.

478
00:36:04,114 --> 00:36:06,573
- I had something I ought to do.
- Is it done?

479
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:25,226
- How're you doing?
- Never been better.

480
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,640
I don't know what is the plan for you lad.

481
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:34,013
I reckon I had enough coin
for a bath...

482
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,360
What's keeping Gunpowder?

483
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,204
Farrier's probably
up his horse again.

484
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,280
When I kill a man

485
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:03,720
I like him to stay dead.

486
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Why?

487
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:13,178
Why did you do it?
Why did you murder the Ryans?

488
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Why?

489
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:24,920
You should have heard them squeal
when I shot them.

490
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:27,252
Beg for mercy.

491
00:38:28,065 --> 00:38:30,080
They would have done
anything I wanted.

492
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,360
Put the gun down.

493
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,274
- I said drop it.
- Stay out of this.

494
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,600
- This bastard murdered the Ryans.
- I know.

495
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,197
I heard him admit it.

496
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,660
I know he shot you too.

497
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:47,881
I got the lead
from the Chinese digger.

498
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:50,200
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's not about me.

499
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,520
The law will deal with him.
He'll hang for what he's done.

500
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:55,915
You shoot him,
you'll hang in his place.

501
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:57,400
I don't think he will.

502
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,808
How did you find us?

503
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:09,003
I followed these two clowns.

504
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:16,600
You make sure he hangs.

505
00:39:17,426 --> 00:39:18,960
He'll hang alright.

506
00:39:38,432 --> 00:39:39,880
I'll walk you back into town.

507
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:42,240
You play hop?
I'll be forced to shoot you.

508
00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:46,493
And my hat?

509
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:51,070
- What did I miss?
- Not much.

510
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,468
As for the rest of you,

511
00:39:52,966 --> 00:39:54,706
I'll be back to arrest you later.

512
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:58,080
We'll stay right here.

513
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:07,480
Tell us again how you called
that murderer Mongrel Butler.

514
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,481
Nah, Bill.

515
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,720
Seems you're
something of a town hero, Sergeant.

516
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,320
- Just doing my job.
- If so, you would have caught Keenan.

517
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:17,080
Not let him get away
when he was right under your nose.

518
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,891
I figured he was a ghost,
as we all believed he was dead.

519
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:24,680
You deserve a freebee.

520
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:27,140
Or maybe half price.

521
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:30,040
I don't think so, Ruby.
Not tonight.

522
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:39,941
Mary.

523
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:42,646
Taking your chance, aren't you?

524
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,960
Mick told me everything.

525
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:50,280
That you were so full of revenge.
Nothing else mattered.

526
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:53,872
- I can explain.
- Don't need to.

527
00:40:55,095 --> 00:40:56,640
You'll never change.

528
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:58,241
Mary.
