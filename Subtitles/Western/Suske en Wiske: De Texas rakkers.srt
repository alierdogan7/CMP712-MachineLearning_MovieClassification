1
00:01:57,713 --> 00:02:00,579
All right, men.
This time we'll catch him.

2
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,597
Come on.
Let's go.

3
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:11,863
Retreat.

4
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:15,730
They're coming.
Back to the mine. Go!

5
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,827
Retreat.

6
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:02,112
Come on, guys.
Into the mine.

7
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,950
All right, Ben.
We got them now.

8
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,330
Tomorrow will be
all in the papers.

9
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,776
No, not you Betty.

10
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,753
You have to stand
guard here, ok?

11
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:21,133
Come on!

12
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,074
Ok.

13
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,689
Finally, we're gonna
find out who is hiding

14
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,831
behind that mask.

15
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:37,754
He's huge, he's mean
and if he can't cook either

16
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:40,212
he must be John’s wife.

17
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,111
You think, you're
so funny, ha?

18
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:48,856
Hey, could someone
turn the light here?

19
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:50,678
Quiet.

20
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,381
Holy cow.

21
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:09,193
Parasite is turned to a giant.
-Hello, my friend.

22
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:14,147
You've shrank and your
problems only began.

23
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:36,443
Rick, for me?
-No.

24
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:40,781
Rick, for me?
-I said no.

25
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,481
Stop it already.
Those aren't toys.

26
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,190
For me.

27
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,717
Hand it over.

28
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:58,464
Don't you worry
about been so tiny.

29
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:02,416
Soon, you'll be the same size
as everybody else.

30
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,213
You wanna know why?

31
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:08,980
Because, soon
everyone will be tiny.

32
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,188
Another rose over
there are for me?

33
00:05:55,386 --> 00:06:03,259
LUKE and LUCY

34
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:31,172
THE TEXAS RANGERS

35
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:55,730
Don't go, Betty. Where
you go? Come back here. Wait!

36
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,567
Yes. Yes. Come on.
Come on. I got you. Yes.

37
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,496
Yes! Luke the Kid
strikes again.

38
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:09,644
Luke the Kid?
You mean Luke the clown.

39
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,901
Hey, watch it.
-Not like that.

40
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:15,676
Hey, leave me alone.
What are you doing?

41
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:19,862
Oh, now look what
you done. -Who me?

42
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:22,329
You are terrible player.

43
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,589
Tell me, was that
my fault? No.

44
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,540
Was the Luke the
clown's fault? Yeah. See?

45
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,048
Girls.

46
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,745
Now it's my turn.

47
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,108
Forget it.
I get to go again.

48
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,272
Why don't you both help
me instead of sitting

49
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,491
in front that screen all day?

50
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:42,769
Luke will help you.

51
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,499
It's my turn to play now.

52
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,646
Why? No way,
it's still my turn.

53
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,822
Hey, Toby. Is
everything all right?

54
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,290
That's a good dog.

55
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,651
I'll go get the door.
-No, I'll go. It's my turn.

56
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,045
No, it's ok, I'll do it.
-That was my...

57
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:33,397
Good afternoon,
Luke and Lucy.

58
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,141
Theofil Boemerang!
-Theofil Boemerang?

59
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:49,493
Ambrose speaking.
-Theofil Boemerang!

60
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:51,758
Theofil Boemerang?

61
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,292
That's right.
Theofil Boemerang.

62
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,699
Sort of kind traveling
salesman.

63
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,647
Everything sell cheap
and not expensive.

64
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:02,092
Aunt Sybil, fancy
meeting you here.

65
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,275
Do I have deal for you?

66
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:06,372
You've never seen anything
like this incredible,

67
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,895
unbelievable,
amazing machine.

68
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:13,300
And if you go ahead and buy
two you only pay for three.

69
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:18,190
Thank you.
See you again soon.

70
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:28,107
Yes, I know.
I know.

71
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:37,369
Manuel, you see
something here?

72
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,999
No. -Here?
-A que? -No.

73
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,076
There should be a bottle here.

74
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:46,824
A, si. Una botella.
-Yeah, yeah. With Ranger Tom.

75
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:50,468
Si, si. Ranger Tom.
-It's disappeared.

76
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:53,051
Vanished.
-Hand it over. -Que?

77
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:57,238
Give me the bottle.
-I may not a botella.

78
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:00,311
You mean, you don't
have a bottle? -No.

79
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,083
You mean he escaped?

80
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,084
Si.

81
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:13,296
Oh, damn to him.
Damn it.

82
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,607
Oh, damn damn. Damn it.
-If the boss finds out...

83
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:19,375
Oh, damn damn. Damn it.
-Wait, wait, wait.

84
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:21,448
We move this one
over here. No, no, no.

85
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:22,901
That one over there.

86
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:24,903
Others missing there.

87
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:27,907
Is something wrong?

88
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:32,686
Well? -No. Nothing.
I was just gonna...

89
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:35,508
I want to...
-Manuel?

90
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:38,830
Ranger Tom vanished.
-What?

91
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:42,872
You, idiots. Go find
him. Immediately!

92
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:46,259
Let's have that.
-Not for me?

93
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,416
Oh, damn, damn, damn.

94
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:54,240
Or maybe you can tell me
where your boss is gone, ha?

95
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,237
Go away.
I'm not home.

96
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:25,851
Oh, Mr. Ambrose,
I took the opportunity

97
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,375
to sweep your
chimney for you.

98
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,502
In black, of course.

99
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:42,898
Phil Boomerang.

100
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:51,518
What did Wilbur tell Phil?

101
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,209
Hold down, Wilbur.

102
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,672
I can explain.
-Told you, stay away.

103
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:00,749
There.

104
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,557
Browse, browse, browse.

105
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:09,869
I know, but Wilbur understand...
-He sold the aunty yet another

106
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,479
vacuum cleaner and you?
-Me?

107
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,855
Forget about it. It'll
have to be more cutting

108
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,491
before he can sell me
anything. -Yeah, yeah.

109
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:21,558
Where is Theofil?

110
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,099
Gone to the seaside.

111
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,062
Help!

112
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:36,944
Ok, Ambrose. So, what
did he sell you this time?

113
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:39,720
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
-Nothing? So what about

114
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:43,152
that case? -Yeah.
-Well, just that's.

115
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:46,057
Case with nothing in it.
Do you really mind, ha?

116
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,677
Do you think, it always need
to contain things?

117
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:51,151
I say no. No, to the tyranny
of minus consumption?

118
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:55,312
No, to the...
-It's booze. It's whisky.

119
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:57,964
Come on. Let me
see it. -It's not whisky.

120
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:01,431
It's... it's... a cough
medicine. -Let me see.

121
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:03,521
Come on, Lucy.
Let go of it.

122
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,788
Good for my health.

123
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:08,381
Now look what you did.

124
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,944
Hey.

125
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,550
What is this?

126
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:27,819
So, have you found the case
with the missing Ranger?

127
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,400
Well, the thing is that
case got shipped to Boston

128
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,553
couple of days ago, boss.
-A, Boston. The Red Socks

129
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:36,896
ruins the Celtics, The Patriots
bill belly check Tom Brady

130
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:40,656
and cream pie. -The guy
must be dead, boss.

131
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:47,184
Dead? Brady? No. No.
No. Brady. Brady.

132
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:52,485
If someone finds that Ranger,
my plans will be exposed.

133
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:55,520
I want that case back.
-Get up, Manuel. Come on.

134
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,028
Call Bill.

135
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:03,181
Oh, Brady no...

136
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,661
He's wearing an
cowboy outfit.

137
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:34,863
Yeah, he's a Texas Ranger,
like in our game.

138
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:38,493
I had never seen
anything like it.

139
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:42,521
This tiny band yet complete.

140
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:44,878
Well, professor.

141
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,879
Professor?

142
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:51,548
Oh, yes. Well... This is
obviously human being

143
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,384
of the male persuasion.
Everything is there. Two arms,

144
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:59,550
two legs. Something just
shrunk him.

145
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:03,231
Quite a lot.

146
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,041
Sounds like a
thunderstorm coming.

147
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:09,383
It's Wilbur's stomach.
It's a bit empty.

148
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:12,228
Go have a look in
the kitchen, Wilbur.

149
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:13,900
There's a fridge.
Help yourself.

150
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,171
Some people might actually
been thirsty, professor.

151
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:21,029
Absolutely. Good point,
Ambrose.

152
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,810
Our Ranger is completely
parched. He needs water badly.

153
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:29,010
What? Oh, yes, yes.

154
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:32,422
That's exactly
what I meant.

155
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:41,529
Look at my jacket. That Wilbur
think he's strong, does he?

156
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,301
Hey, you!

157
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,578
What do you
think you're doing?

158
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:47,204
Boemerang.
-Bill?

159
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,565
Those cases with whiskey
you bought from us yesterday.

160
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:52,979
Where are they?

161
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:08,245
I suggest I keep him here
overnight for observation.

162
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:10,947
Drop or two and
he'll be a lot better.

163
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:14,556
That's good, professor.
We will be back tomorrow.

164
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:16,490
Come on, kids. It's
getting really late.

165
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,023
Well, has Wilbur got?

166
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,817
My guess, this store
hasn't finished yet.

167
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,906
Look, Ambrose. You left the
front door open again.

168
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:50,096
That's impossible.

169
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,834
Stop. We've been
burglarized.

170
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:03,829
Take a deep breath.
Nobody move.

171
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,580
Thank you. I must have
the investigation.

172
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:11,223
One foot prints.

173
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:15,277
The burglar had
at least one leg.

174
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,443
And he can writes.

175
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:21,381
Uh, you're so smart.
How do you know?

176
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:23,481
He left the letter
on the wall.

177
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,866
Sorry for the mess,
Ambrose.

178
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:28,349
I did not find the
case of whiskey,

179
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,355
but if you really want to
enjoy your retirement,

180
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:35,080
bring the case to the Anchor
bar and come alone.

181
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,769
So, not with two or
more people but alone.

182
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,449
That means not with
the hundred or more

183
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,946
or two hundred or more.

184
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:47,258
I guess, he means alone.
-My thoughts exactly.

185
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,817
The Anchor is a city's
seller joint in a harbor.

186
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:54,226
I'll go. I know it well.
-Oh, yeah?

187
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,344
Hm, only by reputation.

188
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:20,736
Are you Ambrose?

189
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,004
You did come alone, right?

190
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:28,770
Whiskey or did you bring
your own bottle?

191
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:32,899
I asked, did you bring
the bottles? -Bottles?

192
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,893
But why the bottles?
To get the money?

193
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:40,606
They want those bottles
back in Texas, you clown.

194
00:19:40,607 --> 00:19:43,030
Give them to me or else.
-How did that Texas Ranger

195
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:44,708
get in that bottle?

196
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:47,178
A Ranger? I haven't
a clue.

197
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:49,993
Through the bottle neck?

198
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:54,507
And who shrank
him and why? And how?

199
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:56,597
And how often?
-Listen Mr. Jeopardy,

200
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,681
did you bring
the bottles or not?

201
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:02,089
You have enough to drink.
You don't need another bottle.

202
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,799
Is that so? His
memory is failing, guys.

203
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I think,
he'll need a kick.

204
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:14,045
Oh, no, you don't.

205
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,788
So, are you gonna talk now?

206
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,810
I don't know anything. We work
for Bill Buster of the Seahawk.

207
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:29,341
He's your mad.
-You see?

208
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:31,480
Why didn't you say
so right away?

209
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:36,325
Alright. This drinks for
you but in moderation.

210
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:51,447
Good night, gentlemen.

211
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:57,063
Oh, God. It's Ambrose.

212
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:59,734
Look what you done,
you clown. -Me?

213
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:02,533
You are the one who wanted to
come here in the first place.

214
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:04,639
You told me to hit the
first guy they came out.

215
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,382
Did I tell him to
hit Ambrose? No.

216
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:12,303
Oh, don't start now.

217
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,409
I shouldn't drink any more.
Just one sip of whiskey and

218
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,189
my head hurts.
-Yeah. Ambrose,

219
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,220
your head hurts
because of me.

220
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:25,979
Did you find anything
out in there?

221
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,472
Yes, Bill Buster of the
Seahawk. He's a man.

222
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:31,977
The Seahawk. That's a
ship. Come on, Luke.

223
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:32,984
I'm coming with you.

224
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:38,287
Hold on. Is that the stick you
hit me over the head with?

225
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:39,727
Yeah.

226
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:45,606
Oh, may, then it's
high time I fainted.

227
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,259
Oh, Ambrose.

228
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,384
What we do now?

229
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:56,124
Taxi.

230
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,095
The Seahawk.
That's it.

231
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,071
How we'll find
Bill Buster here?

232
00:22:33,072 --> 00:22:35,267
Well, just ask around.

233
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:40,024
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find Bill Buster?

234
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,941
Cabin seven.
-Thank you.

235
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,590
Stupid animal.
Don't wake me for that.

236
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:51,196
Six.

237
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,121
Oh, it's here.

238
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,221
Shell we knock first
or do we just walk in?

239
00:22:56,671 --> 00:22:58,951
It's not gonna
be that simple.

240
00:22:58,952 --> 00:22:59,952
He's got a gun.

241
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,590
Hold on.

242
00:23:08,478 --> 00:23:10,277
Come on.

243
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:12,766
There you go.
All right.

244
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,553
Just a little bit further.

245
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,323
You see?

246
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,793
Yeah. Come on.
Come on.

247
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:32,300
Good evening.
-Freeze. Don't move.

248
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,954
What shouldn't you
be in bed right now?

249
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:37,577
I'm asking the
questions here.

250
00:23:37,578 --> 00:23:39,851
What do you know
about that Texas Ranger

251
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,642
in the whiskey bottle?
-What Texas Ranger?

252
00:23:42,643 --> 00:23:44,696
What bottle?

253
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,545
Maybe you don't realize
who you dealing with?

254
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:50,754
This is Luke the Clown.
Luke the Kid.

255
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:52,691
He's the sharpest
shooter in town.

256
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:53,725
Get him, Kid.

257
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,799
OK. OK. Easy.

258
00:23:57,343 --> 00:23:59,763
I work for Jim Parasite.

259
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,991
The biggest whiskey
distillery in Texas.

260
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:05,859
Moonshine whiskey. We sold
some cases to Boemerang

261
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,932
and the boss
wants them back.

262
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,401
And why is that?

263
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:12,176
Hold on a minute.
Hey, that's my gun.

264
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,437
And that gun's not loaded.

265
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:24,171
Hey, stop or I'll... shoot.

266
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,646
Stop.
I said stop.

267
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:43,205
Hey. Did you just knock?
Come on, get inside.

268
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:48,837
Good night, Bill.

269
00:24:55,588 --> 00:24:57,556
Bill Buster said,
that the bottles came

270
00:24:57,557 --> 00:25:01,145
from  distillery in Texas,
owned by a guy, called

271
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:04,715
Jim Parasite.
-Jim Parasite? Where is he?

272
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,500
Easy now. Easy.
You are safe here.

273
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,277
Nice to meet you.
I'm Lucy

274
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:12,333
and this is
my brother Luke.

275
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:13,871
What happened to you?

276
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,914
I'm Tom

277
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:19,554
from the Texas's Rangers.

278
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:23,202
I been shrunk
by Jim Parasite.

279
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:27,065
Parasite is a crock,
who terrorized a Dark city

280
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:28,772
with his gang.

281
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:31,079
The Sheriff
couldn't hold it him, so,

282
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,864
they sent me and my men.

283
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,882
We almost got
them too but...

284
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:41,726
Parasite got a hold of
some magic powder.

285
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:45,674
He shrunk me and
all the other Rangers,

286
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:48,805
but I got away.

287
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:52,872
Parasite planning terrible
things. I have to go back.

288
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:55,866
Forget about it.

289
00:25:55,867 --> 00:26:01,109
That's a job to big
for a man so small.

290
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,667
Besides, we need
to find an antidote

291
00:26:02,668 --> 00:26:06,054
do you mind
keep on shrinking.

292
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:08,208
Someone has to stop him.

293
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,537
Please.
-Aunty?

294
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:14,366
Go to Texas.

295
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:19,183
Yeah, that's not small fit.

296
00:26:19,184 --> 00:26:23,064
It could be dangerous.
I don't know such an expedition

297
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:26,725
is doom to fail
without a real leader.

298
00:26:26,726 --> 00:26:28,200
That's a problem.

299
00:26:28,201 --> 00:26:30,718
You know, leadership
is a rare quality.

300
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,274
You if either got
it or you don't, right?

301
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:36,591
So, it's important to
choose the right leader

302
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:40,011
a specially if you...
-Say Ambrose.

303
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:43,182
Me? Ok, I accept. Thanks
for a lot of confidence.

304
00:26:43,183 --> 00:26:47,326
I'll be the leader of this
expedition as such I say,

305
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:53,279
I...We... What we
want to do again?

306
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,144
Yes. We're going
to Texas. -Yeah.

307
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:05,051
Hello. Boss?
I found that Ranger.

308
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:08,383
Yeah. But there
is a small problem.

309
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:10,078
What?

310
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:14,296
Get rid of that Ranger and
the professor immediately.

311
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:18,181
Nobody will stop me.
I will be the biggest,

312
00:27:18,182 --> 00:27:26,765
the greatest, I tell you.
The greatest. The king.

313
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:38,212
Please, save me
to that country

314
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:42,412
where the eagles fly,

315
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:48,420
where the wolf how
the love some...

316
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:56,827
Take me where
the rocks are colored red

317
00:27:56,828 --> 00:28:00,530
and my Texas
girlfriends name is

318
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:05,118
Ginger Red.

319
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:11,752
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.

320
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:19,473
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.

321
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:22,707
Please take me
where the mountains

322
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:29,298
are mountain high.
Where time is

323
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:33,674
on my side.

324
00:28:34,437 --> 00:28:41,000
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.

325
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,088
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.

326
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:06,573
Please save me
where the foxes

327
00:29:06,574 --> 00:29:09,644
the rules and debase.

328
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:18,132
Live together in the harmony.

329
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:25,034
O,o, let's go to the
land of Utah, honey.

330
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:28,255
Has anyone see an
Ranger's office yet?

331
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:30,925
I hope they have
a hair dryer.

332
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:34,047
And fridge.
I'm hungry.

333
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:38,440
Are you hungry again?
-Wilbur always hungry.

334
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:41,228
Right there.
It's over there.

335
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,487
Over there.

336
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:50,692
Yeah.

337
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:04,399
I found the composition
of the shrinking powder

338
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,216
in ancient texts.

339
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:11,059
It's made of the tiny wini
bush, very rare plant.

340
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,495
It's only grows in
American south west.

341
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,151
From the plant's DNA

342
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:22,823
we take the genes
that keep the bush so small.

343
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:31,948
Ready?

344
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:44,135
Why didn't that work?

345
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:46,958
I was absolutely certain.

346
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,700
These things happen, doc.

347
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:51,690
Better luck next time.

348
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:06,847
One, two. One, two.
Test. Test. Test.

349
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:09,370
You look great in this.

350
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:11,620
Yes, especially me.

351
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,506
Oh, Ambrose. You look
wonderful.

352
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:19,130
I always say,
the love is blind.

353
00:31:20,242 --> 00:31:24,070
Come on, Luke. Check out
the neighborhood. -Yeah.

354
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:35,970
Wilbur and I will visit the
Sheriff office maybe...

355
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:38,556
Ambrose, watch out!

356
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:42,772
Gosh, is quite excited.

357
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:47,248
It's a badge. Must be
the Ranger's horse.

358
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,135
Maybe she's Ranger's
Tom horse?

359
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,907
Oh, poor thing.
Look how sad she looks.

360
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:59,850
Easy, girl. Don't worry, your
boss is completely  safe with us.

361
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,064
Our professor will do
everything he can

362
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:05,009
to cure him and then
will come back to you, ok?

363
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:10,962
Ambrose new girlfriend.

364
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:16,506
Make good par. Betty
horse, Ambrose donkey.

365
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,969
Hi.
-Hi.

366
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,566
Good day, sir.

367
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:32,827
Howdy.
-Get inside.

368
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:36,359
Let's take a look over there.

369
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,745
Good day, sir.

370
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:47,980
Welcome dear customers

371
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:50,081

372
00:32:50,082 --> 00:32:52,583
There's cheap
and not expensive.

373
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:56,227
Theofil? -No.
Theodore is the name.

374
00:32:56,228 --> 00:32:58,365
Theofil is my cousin
from Boston.

375
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:00,674
He has been
here a few times.

376
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:03,598
He's an excellent salesman.

377
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,899
Do you know him?
-Do we ever.

378
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:11,119
Great. So, what did
you want to buy?

379
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,371
We looking for the
shrinking Rangers.

380
00:33:14,715 --> 00:33:17,034
Shrinking Rangers?

381
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:19,382
Shrinking Rangers?

382
00:33:19,383 --> 00:33:22,073
We seem to be all
out those right now

383
00:33:22,074 --> 00:33:24,249
but I can order some more.

384
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,703
Now, come on.
We just here to help.

385
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,598
Do you know what
happened to them?

386
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:32,792
And who is
this Jim Parasite?

387
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:38,740
Ku-ku, ku-ku.
Gosh, look at the time.

388
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:41,713
Closing time.
Time to go.

389
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:46,081
It was very nice to
meeting you. Bye-bye.

390
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:47,433
But...

391
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:56,376
What was that all about?
-Who knows.

392
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:03,892
Hi. -Hello. We are the
new Texas Rangers.

393
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:07,010
New Rangers?
Why new Rangers, pal?

394
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,605
What's wrong
with the old ones, ha?

395
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,766
Well, they have been shrink
in bottle, do you know?

396
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,490
Get out of here.
Who told you that?

397
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:19,781
You know, the Rangers
left because was absolutely

398
00:34:19,816 --> 00:34:24,044
nothing to do here.
-Yeah, right. Liar.

399
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,404
No, it's true. Nothing ever
happened in Dark city.

400
00:34:27,405 --> 00:34:30,732
It's a boring town.

401
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:35,354
And this Parasite who
terrorizes everyone?

402
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:38,843
Oh, that's just an old tale.
You know, cowboys stories.

403
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:41,623
So, you don't
need us here?

404
00:34:41,624 --> 00:34:44,115
Of course not.
It's under control.

405
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:56,521
What is that?
-A party?

406
00:34:59,132 --> 00:35:01,157
Come on.

407
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:03,076
You don't scare me.
Come on.

408
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:05,295
Do you hear that?

409
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:07,523
Someone has to tell them
they have to stop

410
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,808
for playing around like that.
It's dangerous. Come on.

411
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:15,638
That cowboys are paid
the horse around.

412
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:29,386
Ok, ok.
Let's start.

413
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,632
I'm a bad girl

414
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:42,223
that what's they say

415
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:50,647
just because I sing all
night and sleep all day

416
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,840
I'm a bad girl

417
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:04,057
but my heart not
made of wood

418
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:08,197
want some sweet
lovin' daddy come

419
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:13,111
and make me be good.

420
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:17,060
He could be strong for me

421
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:19,639
big and brawny for me

422
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,935
so sweet to me

423
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,234
soft and need for me.

424
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:27,582
He never go out fishing

425
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,157
he'll be missing Missy's kissin

426
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:37,041
oh, wild the girl I could be.

427
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:42,588
I'm just a soul girl

428
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:48,098
see you lonely in the world

429
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:53,542
and I'm ready for some papa
to come along and hapa

430
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:58,863
be my dream

431
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:07,445
and make a real good
girl out of me.

432
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:18,714
I'm not a bad girl.

433
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,215
Watch out. You can
swallow a fly.

434
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:39,700
Hey, guys.
We got visitors.

435
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:42,768
So, what brings the short barley
and the lady with the big feet,

436
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:46,646
two shorty’s and a baldy to
our beautiful town?

437
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:50,873
We're here to restore order.

438
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:54,532
Mama, help.

439
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,979
First, you will need to prove
you brave enough to be

440
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,681
a real Ranger,
you little pipsqueak.

441
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:04,446
Showdown. Showdown.
Showdown.

442
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:08,350
Hey. -Ojla. -I'm not
afraid. Bring it on.

443
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:11,394
Allow me to interrupt,
but this calls for real hero, Luke.

444
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:13,233
By the way, if you
have newspaper here

445
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:18,275
I'm Ambrose with an "S",
as...special.

446
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:24,092
Lady special needs,
rest is in "as stupid."

447
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,188
Alive rattlesnake
with a deadly bite.

448
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:31,574
And the rules are, we will
put our hands on the table,

449
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,601
than the snake will be
released. Now, whoever

450
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,983
pulls the hands away
first, is the loser.

451
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:37,921
Manuel.

452
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:41,012
Is this really necessary?

453
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:44,075
Wouldn't you prefer
a nice game of darts?

454
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:47,472
No? Oh, well let's
do it then. -Senior.

455
00:38:47,473 --> 00:38:50,710
A glass of water.
-It's on a house.

456
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:53,045
It might be your last.

457
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,511
Be very careful, Ambrose.
Be very careful.

458
00:38:57,512 --> 00:39:02,071
If necessary,
Wilbur eat snake.

459
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:10,971
Don't make it mad.
Don't make it mad.

460
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:20,765
The cowboys cheated.

461
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:23,158
They rubbed your
glass with the potion,

462
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,122
that attract snakes.

463
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:27,710
Whoever tries to hurt Ambrose,
will have to deal with me.

464
00:39:27,711 --> 00:39:31,136
And with me.
-And with me.

465
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:32,988
Hey.

466
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:35,077
Hey, Ambrose.

467
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:37,961
Oh, yeah.

468
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:44,063
Saloon fight not for me.
Carry this outside.

469
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:57,101
Who's next?
Let's go.

470
00:39:57,102 --> 00:39:59,982
Comfortable like this?
-Take this.

471
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:04,983
A real gentlemen.
-Wilbur?

472
00:40:04,984 --> 00:40:07,154
Come on.
-I'll be back.

473
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:22,672
Your friend is
very strong, isn't he?

474
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:27,173
Let's say,
strongest but rough.

475
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,148
Just doesn't have finesse.

476
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:31,535
You messing with the best.

477
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:39,858
Asta la vista, baby.

478
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:41,280
Gracias.

479
00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:45,310
I'm completely
change the formula.

480
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:47,788
This time will
work for sure.

481
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,192
Just a drop.

482
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:11,051
Damn it, failed again.
How is that possible?

483
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,243
I think you must move.

484
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,296
But I will get it right.

485
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:20,823
Don't you worry. Even if it
takes me hundred years.

486
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:37,406
We are not get it at all.

487
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:39,917
Seems, nobody knows
about Parasite.

488
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:42,004
And if they do know
something, they are afraid

489
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:44,536
to talk to anyone.
After yesterday...

490
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,454
Good morning.
-Good morning.

491
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:50,397
Is this a bad time?
-Not at all, miss. Come in.

492
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:54,087
Well, we were discussing the
situation in Dark city.

493
00:41:54,088 --> 00:41:57,861
Maybe you can help miss...
-It's Miss Missy.

494
00:41:57,862 --> 00:42:00,393
Beautiful name.

495
00:42:00,882 --> 00:42:02,988
Well, Miss Missy,
I'm sorry.

496
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,621
We have to apologize
for our behavior.

497
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:08,258
Wilbur was stupid enough
to wreck the saloon

498
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,830
and now because of him
Miss Missy you're of a job.

499
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:13,648
That's ok, Ambrose.

500
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:16,473
The music industry
isn't doing well anyway.

501
00:42:16,474 --> 00:42:18,669
With all that downloading
and all. -Yeah.

502
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:20,797
As Lucy was saying,

503
00:42:20,798 --> 00:42:22,922
maybe you can
help us out a little.

504
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:26,436
Maybe you can tell us some
more about Jim Parasite.

505
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:32,271
Me? But why I would
know more about him?

506
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:36,114
You are a... bar made.

507
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:39,540
You hear things in the
saloon. Don't you?

508
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,022
Yes, but it's all busy talk.

509
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:46,272
And if they talk to me
it's always for the same reason.

510
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,984
I can imagine.

511
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,796
No, I don't think you can.

512
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:55,753
Come down, aunty.

513
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:57,406
Well, I thought I could
help but I guess so

514
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,352
just go back to my hotel.

515
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,930
It will be my pleasure
to escort you to your...

516
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:07,735
hotel miss.
-Wilbur will take Missy.

517
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:09,667
I think she has a preference
for the more elegant

518
00:43:09,668 --> 00:43:12,326
man on the world.
-I think so too.

519
00:43:12,327 --> 00:43:15,777
Missy not interest it
in bald head it wing backs.

520
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:18,512
Well, I least I don't look
like Shrek's ugly brother.

521
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,473
No. Ambrose
don't this ugly brother.

522
00:43:21,817 --> 00:43:24,051
Maybe let Missy decide, hm?

523
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:26,825
Well, we will ask
her right away then.

524
00:43:27,203 --> 00:43:30,917
Well, this really separates
the men from the boys.

525
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,018
Thanks for walking me
back to my room, Luke.

526
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,890
That was very sweet.

527
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:45,516
What's with you guys?

528
00:43:52,072 --> 00:43:54,292
I think, aunty is
on the something.

529
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,905
That means Missy could
be Parasite accomplice.

530
00:43:56,906 --> 00:43:59,669
Oh, come on, Lucy.
With eyes like that?

531
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,124
Snap out of it, man.

532
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:03,291
Yeah and talking
about being suspicious.

533
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:06,510
What about that Sheriff?
He's real weirdo.

534
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:09,712
Hides in his office all day
refusing to make a stand.

535
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:13,593
No, how can he be?
His legs in the cast.

536
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,553
Hey, you think, Theodor has
any dealing with Parasite?

537
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:21,249
I'm so. I bet he already sold a
couple of vacuum cleaners.

538
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,454
Yeah, dirt cheap
and not expensive.

539
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:31,491
Oh, Luke.

540
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:34,940
There is something
weird is going on.

541
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:45,450
Last warning.

542
00:44:45,627 --> 00:44:51,058
You leaving Dark city
today. All of you.

543
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:03,547
J.P.
-Jim Parasite.

544
00:45:03,548 --> 00:45:05,217
That was Parasite.

545
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:08,798
Aunty.
-Children. Are you all right?

546
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:11,691
Who was that shooting?
I'll show them.

547
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:14,767
He was Parasite. He
wants us to leave town.

548
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:17,731
Oh, really?

549
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:20,230
What a shame. Well,
you know,

550
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:23,343
we're not welcome here. Maybe
it's just better if we get out.

551
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:26,178
We are not letting him chase
us away, are we aunty?

552
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:29,323
No. We have to make
that bully understand

553
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:32,559
we're not afraid.
We had to be careful.

554
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,298
Ambrose. Wilbur.
You two will comb the town.

555
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,969
Comb the town,
you say?

556
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,155
Talk the words right
out of my mouth.

557
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:43,433
Street presents.
Shown the town,

558
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:45,642
that everything
is under control.

559
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:49,721
I think,
we should split out.

560
00:45:49,722 --> 00:45:52,515
Yes, good plan.
We split up.

561
00:45:52,516 --> 00:46:00,646
I go left side of town.
-Ok. And... and I go the right.

562
00:46:09,328 --> 00:46:11,943
Ambrose can choose.

563
00:46:20,384 --> 00:46:22,701
Aunty, we'll go
tell the Sheriff

564
00:46:22,702 --> 00:46:24,954
and let him know,
that we saw Jim Parasite.

565
00:46:24,955 --> 00:46:28,854
Ok. But remember,
be very careful.

566
00:46:39,918 --> 00:46:42,563
Yeah, come on in.

567
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:46,369
Is he gone?
-Who?

568
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,823
Who? Who do you
think? Santa Claus.

569
00:46:48,824 --> 00:46:52,262
Parasite, of course. -How
did you know was him?

570
00:46:52,263 --> 00:46:55,439
It must of be him.
It's always him.

571
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,469
Hey, what kind
of Sheriff are you?

572
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,286
You heard him shooting
yet you do nothing?

573
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,918
Listen, little lady.
My legs on the cast.

574
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:04,798
I can't do anything.

575
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:08,395
And besides, I...

576
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:11,347
Who I'm kidding?

577
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,284
Even without a broken leg,
I couldn't do a thing.

578
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,581
Nobody can touch Parasite.

579
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:21,485
It's too powerful and
way too dangerous.

580
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:26,784
Friends, trust me.
Get out of here

581
00:47:26,785 --> 00:47:29,741
before will something
terrible happens.

582
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:31,844
I'm serious.

583
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:54,737
What are you doing here?

584
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:57,642
I'm a... combing town.

585
00:47:57,643 --> 00:48:01,337
Oh, right. But I combed
everything here already.

586
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:03,627
Why don't you go
comb somewhere else?

587
00:48:03,628 --> 00:48:06,890
Better if Wilbur double comb.

588
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:13,342
Well, do you comb
this part of town?

589
00:48:13,343 --> 00:48:16,537
Well...I...I... I thought you
deserve some pretty flowers.

590
00:48:16,538 --> 00:48:19,230
Get in here, you dove.

591
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:22,672
I don't trust that Miss Missy
not one little bit

592
00:48:22,673 --> 00:48:25,466
and I discovered
something big.

593
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,023
Me too.

594
00:48:28,724 --> 00:48:31,552
Not that, you ninny.

595
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,517
More like this.

596
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:49,303
What are you doing here?

597
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:52,132
Came to bring flowers.
-Yap, me too.

598
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:54,366
And I want to ask
you some questions.

599
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:57,139
Where were you
the past half hour?

600
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,010
I was taking a bath, ok?

601
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:02,892
And now I would like all of
you to get out of my room.

602
00:49:02,893 --> 00:49:04,743
Right now!

603
00:49:04,744 --> 00:49:06,748
Already go.

604
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:13,081
Must forgive friends.
Friends no manners.

605
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:19,023
Missy Stuart.
Wilbur help drive off.

606
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:23,098
Leave me alone.
All of you.

607
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:29,243
There. You hear?
Missy want to be alone.

608
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:51,618
That was heavy. I almost
fell sorry for poor guy.

609
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:54,515
I don't know. Why
is he Sheriff then?

610
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,476
He didn't even have a clue
who Parasite might even be.

611
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:01,108
I think it's someone
from the town.

612
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:03,275
What else he would
hide behind the mask.

613
00:50:03,276 --> 00:50:05,554
Yeah, you right. Ok.

614
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:08,687
So, who in this town
resembles Jim Parasite?

615
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:10,934
Good morning, children.

616
00:50:10,935 --> 00:50:13,974
Something tells me you
two needs new hats.

617
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:16,214
How would you know?

618
00:50:16,945 --> 00:50:19,533
Because yours are already
fill with bullet holes.

619
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:21,624
Come on in.

620
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:29,230
Beautiful design, isn't it?
A hat to tip your head, I say.

621
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,530
Dirt cheap
and not expensive.

622
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:35,392
What do you think?

623
00:50:35,393 --> 00:50:37,453
Well, it's a hat.

624
00:50:37,454 --> 00:50:39,662
Hey, there's something
I would like to know.

625
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:40,866
How they clean those hats?

626
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:42,447
It's very simple.

627
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:44,642
With this multi
functional vacuum cleaner,

628
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:47,106
which comes with it
special head attach.

629
00:50:47,107 --> 00:50:49,486
Wait. That's what we need.

630
00:50:49,487 --> 00:50:52,354
No way. When it's
too easy is not fun.

631
00:50:52,355 --> 00:50:55,337
Theodore, I need some
cases of that whiskey.

632
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:58,400
Excellent choice.
Superb whiskey.

633
00:50:58,401 --> 00:51:01,448
I been for my own barley.

634
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:05,918
Great. I'll take
ten cases.

635
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:08,883
Need tonight. We're
gonna have a party...

636
00:51:08,884 --> 00:51:11,318
for Ambrose's birthday.

637
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:13,978
Today is not Ambrose's...

638
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:16,797
Ten cases of whiskey. Ten.

639
00:51:18,151 --> 00:51:21,110
Go to see my supplier.
I'll be back in one hour.

640
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,338
Bye-bye.

641
00:51:23,893 --> 00:51:28,413
Ten cases. -So, since when
do you buy whiskey?

642
00:51:29,397 --> 00:51:31,009
Didn't you notice?

643
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,864
They were the same exact
cases as Ambrose's.

644
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:38,764
Yeah. -Then you understand
why ordered more

645
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,789
than he had in stock.

646
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,984
Because then he
needs to get more

647
00:51:42,985 --> 00:51:45,130
and does he get them from?

648
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:48,318
From Parasite.
-That's right. -Of, course.

649
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,519
Yeah, yeah. You're
smart. Everybody knows.

650
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:59,137
Ten cases.

651
00:52:49,164 --> 00:52:50,543
Hello!

652
00:52:50,544 --> 00:52:54,306
Is anybody home?
Is anybody here?

653
00:52:56,032 --> 00:52:58,234
Stop.
-A, there is. Good.

654
00:52:58,235 --> 00:52:59,558
I was getting scared.

655
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,265
Boss.

656
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:07,196
There's a problem.

657
00:53:15,538 --> 00:53:19,672
One thing is for sure.
Theodor is not Parasite.

658
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:22,700
Quiet, I wanna hear
what Parasite says.

659
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:24,766
Lucy.
-Be quiet.

660
00:53:24,767 --> 00:53:27,492
Lucy.
-What?

661
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:31,840
Hojla.

662
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:37,636
I hope you have a very good
reason for coming here.

663
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,552
I'm just here to buy whiskey.

664
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:44,128
A lots of whiskey.
Will do good business, a?

665
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,308
Come on.

666
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:48,694
Andale. Arriva.

667
00:53:50,763 --> 00:53:54,787
Is that a new gun?
-Yes. Brand new.

668
00:53:54,788 --> 00:53:57,881
Nice. And are
you happy with it?

669
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,947
Si, si. Very happy.

670
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:02,875
It looks very cool.

671
00:54:03,437 --> 00:54:06,949
Can I hold it?
-No.

672
00:54:09,226 --> 00:54:11,500
Here.
-For me?

673
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:16,575
Only if I can...
-Ok.

674
00:54:18,215 --> 00:54:20,166
Oh, for me.

675
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:22,952
Ole.

676
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:26,681
No. No. No. No. No.

677
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:30,475
Stupido. Stupido.
Stupido.

678
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:35,351
And who is so thirsty
that you have to come here,

679
00:54:35,352 --> 00:54:37,888
what you not supposed to be?

680
00:54:37,923 --> 00:54:40,644
You will be really surprised.

681
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:42,733
The Rangers.
-What?

682
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:47,218
The Rangers? You full.
You brought the Rangers here?

683
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:53,029
They'll need a very
big vacuum cleaner

684
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:57,067
to clean up what's left
of you when I'm done.

685
00:54:57,068 --> 00:54:59,808
Help. What a coincidence.

686
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:03,898
All right, just happen to
have some in stock.

687
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,286
Go. Go. Go. Go.

688
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:25,636
Go after them.

689
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:32,826
Is still hanging on?

690
00:55:33,086 --> 00:55:36,738
Yes he is but
we're not alone.

691
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:47,520
Slow down.
Not so fast.

692
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:03,134
Aunty, help.
-Lucy?

693
00:56:03,135 --> 00:56:06,899
Aunty, help us. We been
pursued by Parasite's gang.

694
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,181
Ambrose. Wilbur.

695
00:56:21,939 --> 00:56:25,545
Lucy, hold on.
They're on their way.

696
00:56:46,815 --> 00:56:50,021
Come on, Theodor.
-I'll do it. I'll do it.

697
00:56:50,022 --> 00:56:52,846
One, two, three.

698
00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:58,883
Lucy, give me your hand.

699
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,775
My little van.

700
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,279
Hey, what is this means?

701
00:57:42,795 --> 00:57:44,529
Look out.

702
00:58:42,879 --> 00:58:45,655
Oh, no. The bridge.
We're too late.

703
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:48,101
Wilbur take care of it.

704
00:58:56,268 --> 00:58:58,555
I coming too.

705
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,622
Oh, Luke. Please tell me
you can stop the train.

706
00:59:17,623 --> 00:59:21,181
I can stop the train.
-Really? -No.

707
00:59:21,596 --> 00:59:24,702
I think that's
a steam whistle.

708
00:59:27,376 --> 00:59:30,424
There's only one
thing left we can do.

709
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:16,993
Oh, it's Wilbur.
-Wilbur. -My hero.

710
01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:19,767
Thanks a lot, Wilbur.
-It's all right.

711
01:00:19,768 --> 01:00:22,778
Otherwise Wilbur blush.

712
01:00:26,988 --> 01:00:29,918
I got it on the control.

713
01:00:35,244 --> 01:00:37,258
They want more?

714
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:40,279
That it's what will they get.

715
01:00:45,904 --> 01:00:49,332
So, were doing
business with Parasite.

716
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:53,276
How could you? -I'm just
a small time shop owner,

717
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,968
who ester on a living.
-What business is slow

718
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:59,230
when a customer is a
customer. -Aunt Cybil,

719
01:00:59,231 --> 01:01:01,623
I knew you not understand.
-That's nonsense.

720
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:04,229
You knew that
Parasite was a bandit

721
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:06,301
and yet you did nothing
to help the Rangers.

722
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:08,394
We have to go
back to the mine.

723
01:01:08,395 --> 01:01:10,885
I believed that Rangers has
been held hostage there.

724
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,553
By now Parasite
has long gone

725
01:01:13,554 --> 01:01:15,486
or hide in one of
the many tunnels.

726
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:18,411
Then we will look for
him there. -No, no. no.

727
01:01:18,412 --> 01:01:19,957
There are no
road signs, you know.

728
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:23,401
Miles and miles of tunnels
full of holes and traps...

729
01:01:23,402 --> 01:01:27,174
This is Ambrose, but you
can call me Mr. Ambrose.

730
01:01:27,175 --> 01:01:29,943
This is Jim Parasite.

731
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:32,598
Jim Parasite? What a
coincidence that you call.

732
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:35,047
We just talking about
you. How are you?

733
01:01:35,048 --> 01:01:36,881
How is the family?

734
01:01:36,882 --> 01:01:39,451
It's Jim Parasite.

735
01:01:43,323 --> 01:01:45,423
Hands up! Don't
move a muscle.

736
01:01:45,424 --> 01:01:48,569
You imbecile. I wanna
talk with your leader.

737
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:52,222
I've a proposition.
-Really? A? Yes.

738
01:01:52,223 --> 01:01:54,157
Well, that's me.

739
01:01:54,158 --> 01:01:56,558
Yes.
-What yes, yes?

740
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,535
Really? Where?
And when?

741
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:02,584
Excellent. Yes, of
course. I'll be there. Ok.

742
01:02:03,084 --> 01:02:05,569
See you later.
Bye Jim.

743
01:02:06,111 --> 01:02:08,516
Voila. Well,
that's taken care of.

744
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:12,495
What's taken care of? -Well, that
J.P. certainly isn't stupid.

745
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:15,504
I mean, he is able to
recognize a real leader.

746
01:02:15,505 --> 01:02:18,693
Hold me back or I'll wrap
the real leader's neck.

747
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:20,572
What's taken care of?

748
01:02:20,573 --> 01:02:23,528
Well, J.P. actually
challenge me to a duel

749
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:26,231
to finally set all this
business once and for all

750
01:02:26,232 --> 01:02:29,006
and of course,
I accept it.

751
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,701
Have you lost your
mind, Ambrose?

752
01:02:31,702 --> 01:02:36,046
Lost my mind? I'll just teach
that pretender who is boss

753
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:38,907
and case closed.
-But Ambrose, don't you know

754
01:02:38,908 --> 01:02:41,786
Parasite is a crack shot?
-And I'm not?

755
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:45,459
Do you see Wilbur's
hat hanging there?

756
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:51,299
Yeah. That was off by a mile.

757
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,381
I...Yes well,
that's because a...

758
01:02:53,382 --> 01:02:57,712
I notice just in time,
there was my hat.

759
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:43,946
Look.

760
01:04:22,107 --> 01:04:26,146
Will you shut him,
you idiots.

761
01:04:37,018 --> 01:04:38,831
Got you.

762
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,947
For me.

763
01:04:56,472 --> 01:05:01,187
No. -Come on.
-For me. For me. For me.

764
01:05:09,516 --> 01:05:11,843
Strike.

765
01:05:23,383 --> 01:05:25,115
And it's nonstick.

766
01:05:59,888 --> 01:06:03,582
Don't run away now.
-No, no. no. no. -OK.

767
01:06:17,458 --> 01:06:20,804
It's Missy's room.

768
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:36,007
Surprise.

769
01:06:51,733 --> 01:06:54,292
Where's Wilbur?
Wasn't he with you?

770
01:06:54,293 --> 01:06:57,393
No. I haven't seen him.
And where is Parasite?

771
01:06:57,394 --> 01:07:02,436
That coward. -Come. Let’s puts
these stags behind bars first.

772
01:07:02,437 --> 01:07:05,509
And where was that Sheriff?

773
01:07:08,035 --> 01:07:10,306
Sheriff?
What happened?

774
01:07:12,686 --> 01:07:16,854
I was... you know...just get
ready to come  watch duel.

775
01:07:16,855 --> 01:07:22,510
I mean, come help you...
and all of sudden Parasite

776
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:24,957
was here and lock
me in the cell.

777
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:28,090
Well, the good news is
we round up the Parasite's

778
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:31,243
entire gang.
-The whole gang?

779
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:34,036
Well, we haven't got
a Parasite himself yet,

780
01:07:34,037 --> 01:07:36,076
but that's just a matter of time.
-And the meantime,

781
01:07:36,077 --> 01:07:38,444
here are the others.
If you could just guard them,

782
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:42,393
when we'll finish our job?
We would be really grateful.

783
01:07:42,394 --> 01:07:46,689
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
Of course. You can count on me.

784
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:49,784
I'm your man.
-Hey, Sheriff.

785
01:07:49,785 --> 01:07:51,737
Now, please listen
to me carefully.

786
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:54,104
Do not let them go.

787
01:07:59,097 --> 01:08:01,738
We haven't got a
clue who might be.

788
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:04,990
The Sheriff didn't do in,
the Theodor didn't do in...

789
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,399
Is not me either or I would
arrested myself a long time ago.

790
01:08:12,065 --> 01:08:14,605
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

791
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:19,852
Jim Parasite is captured
your friend Wilbur.

792
01:08:19,853 --> 01:08:22,187
Leave Dark city
before sundown or

793
01:08:22,188 --> 01:08:25,180
you never see your
friend Wilbur again.

794
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:27,905
Jim Parasite.
-Impossible.

795
01:08:27,906 --> 01:08:30,456
How could Parasite
possibly bit our guy?

796
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:35,100
No way. -Yeah.
-I'm afraid it's true.

797
01:08:37,644 --> 01:08:42,743
If that monster even
durst only a finger on Wilbur I...

798
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:47,086
What we gonna do now?
We can't just leave, can we?

799
01:08:47,087 --> 01:08:51,435
I know it's hard to leave but you
can't put Wilbur's life on a line.

800
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:56,207
I don't want to admit it
but Missy is right.

801
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,581
But aunty...
-There's no other way.

802
01:08:59,085 --> 01:09:04,292
We have to leave.
-Wilbur.

803
01:09:13,699 --> 01:09:16,421
Don't tell me
you're leaving.

804
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:20,979
Are you serious? I hate this
is loyal customers leave.

805
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,858
Say this isn't true. What's
the point of all?

806
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:29,204
Theodore, it is something
you can do for us.

807
01:09:29,205 --> 01:09:31,766
Really?

808
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:39,985
I...well...I have a secrium.
I'll sent Wilbur home,

809
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,905
when I'll catch Parasite.

810
01:09:41,906 --> 01:09:45,464
That's very unsure,
Sheriff.

811
01:09:45,465 --> 01:09:47,482
I'm so sorry, Ambrose.

812
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,498
But I promise I'll do
anything in my power

813
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:53,943
to find your friend.

814
01:10:12,492 --> 01:10:15,678
The law doesn't seem to
be that tough after all.

815
01:10:17,473 --> 01:10:21,346
Wait to friends
get here. -Friends?

816
01:10:21,347 --> 01:10:24,197
You don't have any,
little man.

817
01:10:24,198 --> 01:10:28,160
Luke and Lucy are leaving,
leaving you here to rot.

818
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:31,621
Liar. They wouldn't leave
without Wilbur. -No?

819
01:10:31,622 --> 01:10:35,906
Watch carefully, little man.
It's show time.

820
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:55,636
But is shame.
They're gone.

821
01:10:55,986 --> 01:11:00,223
I can't believe it.
-Looser. Nobody.

822
01:11:00,224 --> 01:11:03,546
They leave you here to rot.
It's so typical.

823
01:11:03,547 --> 01:11:06,048
I would never
know any different,

824
01:11:06,049 --> 01:11:11,954
even as a child.
But then I swore.

825
01:11:12,443 --> 01:11:16,787
Nobody will humiliate
me anymore.

826
01:11:16,788 --> 01:11:19,671
Soon, boom!

827
01:11:19,672 --> 01:11:27,231
And then, I will be the
greatest king of the world.

828
01:11:31,544 --> 01:11:34,563
King craziest.

829
01:11:40,832 --> 01:11:45,820
Theodore, oh, boy. What
got yourself into to now?

830
01:11:45,821 --> 01:11:48,411
Stay calm. Stay calm.

831
01:11:48,412 --> 01:11:51,381
Deep breaths. Our father
in the lighting heaven

832
01:11:51,382 --> 01:11:53,723
I will be done.
Save us from taxes

833
01:11:53,724 --> 01:11:56,279
and while your addit
for competition as well.

834
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,441
Why not?

835
01:12:01,225 --> 01:12:03,719
Listen, doc. I don't
wanna press on you,

836
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:07,294
but I really hope this
will work this time.

837
01:12:07,295 --> 01:12:10,808
This time I'll add a
bit of Flesh Extra.

838
01:12:10,809 --> 01:12:13,221
What Flesh Extra?

839
01:12:13,466 --> 01:12:16,792
Flesh Extra is a
laundry detergent

840
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:19,809
but not just any
laundry detergent.

841
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:23,164
NASA developed to me
the astronauts laundry

842
01:12:23,165 --> 01:12:27,440
shruf proof. I made the
anti-shrinking powder

843
01:12:27,441 --> 01:12:30,446
one hundred times
stronger. It should be

844
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:36,321
story to your previous
dimension if not more.

845
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:40,083
Whatever, doc.
Just pour it.

846
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:42,853
Ready?

847
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:12,030
All right, doc.
You did it, man.

848
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:13,726
Great.

849
01:13:15,264 --> 01:13:17,428
I don't know
how to thank you.

850
01:13:17,429 --> 01:13:21,284
Oh, well, it was
a piece of cake.

851
01:13:39,219 --> 01:13:42,796
Ok, guys.
The coast is clear.

852
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:47,030
A fantastic plan,
children.

853
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:49,506
Did he really think
we run off?

854
01:13:50,023 --> 01:13:52,798
It's time for faced to Jim.

855
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:04,465
Cut it out, Betty.

856
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:06,504
Come on,
get off from me.

857
01:14:07,987 --> 01:14:10,121
Be quiet, girl.

858
01:14:29,482 --> 01:14:32,094
Miss...

859
01:14:33,672 --> 01:14:36,920
What's wrong with you?
-Well, Mr. smooth Casanova,

860
01:14:36,921 --> 01:14:38,800
did you ever think to
wonder where she might

861
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:41,850
be going this late at night?

862
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:44,444
Ok, ok, ok.

863
01:14:55,956 --> 01:14:59,176
Doc, let's go.
It's time to go.

864
01:14:59,177 --> 01:15:02,924
You poor thing, you must
be boil out of your hands.

865
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:06,510
It's time for some
action. Come on.

866
01:15:21,024 --> 01:15:23,724
Parasite break out his  gang.

867
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:25,824
That's not surprise.
Our brave Sheriff

868
01:15:25,825 --> 01:15:28,023
probably just run off.

869
01:15:49,187 --> 01:15:51,278
Careful.

870
01:15:55,621 --> 01:15:57,806
How strange.

871
01:15:57,807 --> 01:16:00,940
She can't fly, can't she?

872
01:16:05,426 --> 01:16:08,917
A secret passage.
-Well done, Ambrose.

873
01:16:08,918 --> 01:16:14,002
Always use your head, I say.

874
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,190
Over there.
There she goes.

875
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:30,842
Let's fallow her.
-No, wait.

876
01:16:30,843 --> 01:16:33,796
I'm the leader.
I make the decisions

877
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:38,533
and I say: "We fallow her."
And: "Action".

878
01:16:56,716 --> 01:16:58,705
Hey.

879
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:10,039
Come on, Luke
or we'll lose her.

880
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:17,587
Hey. Hey.
You guys, come on.

881
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:19,718
Wait for me.

882
01:17:21,305 --> 01:17:25,025
Missy. -What?
What are you doing here?

883
01:17:25,026 --> 01:17:28,194
You're asking us?
How about you?

884
01:17:28,195 --> 01:17:31,461
Hands up, you snake.
-But I ...

885
01:17:31,462 --> 01:17:34,507
I knew you're along
the whole time.

886
01:17:34,508 --> 01:17:37,179
You are lucky Wilbur
is unharmed,

887
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:41,664
a bit smaller but anyway,
otherwise I would give you...

888
01:17:41,665 --> 01:17:44,267
Cybil.
...you traitor.

889
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:47,800
Cybil.
-What? -Look.

890
01:17:48,891 --> 01:17:52,155
Fools. You losers.

891
01:17:52,156 --> 01:17:56,920
Welcome to my kingdom.

892
01:17:59,536 --> 01:18:02,071
For me.

893
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,543
The party is over.

894
01:18:05,544 --> 01:18:10,320
Is now time to meet the
brains behind this operation.

895
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:13,461
And there is...

896
01:18:15,631 --> 01:18:17,796
No. -I knew it.

897
01:18:17,797 --> 01:18:19,508
Oh, yeah? You
don't know anything.

898
01:18:19,509 --> 01:18:22,637
Tell me, how I could
be locked in the jail

899
01:18:22,638 --> 01:18:25,864
and in the tool
the same time, ha?

900
01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:28,485
And get beaten by Ambrose.

901
01:18:28,486 --> 01:18:32,295
Hey, it's simple. There's a
secret trap door in your cell.

902
01:18:32,669 --> 01:18:35,758
You were never locked up
in the first place.

903
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:38,483
While we are around it up
your gang after the duel,

904
01:18:38,484 --> 01:18:42,314
you locked just self in,
you put on your cast

905
01:18:42,315 --> 01:18:44,398
and then you waited for us.

906
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:48,756
How silly of us.
-And cleaver of me.

907
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:53,397
You did good, kid. Eight
plus, but you're too late.

908
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:03,585
This ball contains enough
shrinking powder

909
01:19:03,586 --> 01:19:07,896
to shrink you to
into tiny tiny people.

910
01:19:07,897 --> 01:19:10,949
But you are lucky.
In a minute, you will have

911
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:13,701
the privilege to
been in a front roll

912
01:19:13,702 --> 01:19:17,444
to witness to lunch at the
biggest operation mankind

913
01:19:17,445 --> 01:19:19,391
has ever under take in.

914
01:19:19,392 --> 01:19:23,711
Operation, mini man.

915
01:19:23,712 --> 01:19:27,239
This rocket is about to
be lunch into space

916
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,309
armed with millions of
balls of shrinking powder

917
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:33,707
that will spread it a
chain reaction across

918
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:36,754
all cokmits of the planet
and will make everybody

919
01:19:36,755 --> 01:19:41,326
on Earth tiny tiny people.

920
01:19:41,327 --> 01:19:48,726
And only I will still be big.
Yes, me. Me, me, me, me.

921
01:19:49,226 --> 01:19:53,063
Oh, yes. And then I'll meet
only one more thing

922
01:19:53,098 --> 01:19:56,289
and that is...
-A good shrink? -No.

923
01:19:56,290 --> 01:20:00,619
The only thing I
ever need is a...

924
01:20:02,139 --> 01:20:04,621
No!

925
01:20:12,695 --> 01:20:18,131
I'm small. I'm small.
I'm small.

926
01:20:18,132 --> 01:20:21,392
Get them. I said,
get them.

927
01:20:22,503 --> 01:20:25,740
Now, stand behind me,
ladies. This will hurt.

928
01:20:28,669 --> 01:20:33,221
Well, does it hurt?
-No, no.

929
01:20:35,217 --> 01:20:37,604
Got to the key.

930
01:20:39,447 --> 01:20:41,478
Excuse me, Missy.
Who  are you really?

931
01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:43,213
You want to know
who I am?

932
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:46,931
Undercover FBI agent
on the special mission.

933
01:20:46,932 --> 01:20:49,666
Yes, that was also possibility.

934
01:21:00,996 --> 01:21:03,596
Wilbur.

935
01:21:06,042 --> 01:21:08,962
Stop them, you idiots.

936
01:21:16,698 --> 01:21:20,395
No, no, no.
Por qué?

937
01:21:22,738 --> 01:21:26,621
Come on, Manuel. Pull
yourself together. Here.

938
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:33,863
No, that's ok.
You can keep it.

939
01:21:33,864 --> 01:21:36,156
Yeah, no gracias.
-I said it's ok. Keep it.

940
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:39,896
It's for you.
-Not for me.

941
01:21:41,172 --> 01:21:44,302
Not for me.

942
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:49,485
That's huge.

943
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,471
Look over there.

944
01:21:55,407 --> 01:21:57,648
Come on.
Let's get him.

945
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:14,741
Oh, no. The
children go in there.

946
01:22:21,117 --> 01:22:22,684
Come on.

947
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:43,488
Come on. Move on tight.
-Are you sure?

948
01:22:43,489 --> 01:22:46,314
Yeah.
-Let's go.

949
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:57,999
Hurry up, Luke.

950
01:23:03,933 --> 01:23:06,169
Get back here!

951
01:23:06,512 --> 01:23:09,648
Help! Let us out.

952
01:23:10,597 --> 01:23:13,209
The code.
What's the code.

953
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:16,871
Who wants a little kiss?
-Wilbur.

954
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:22,061
Kiss later. -The first who
will give me the code

955
01:23:22,062 --> 01:23:26,370
gets a really big kiss.
-King! -King! -King! -King!

956
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,261
Hi, everyone.
You have to get out.

957
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:34,521
It's gonna blow.

958
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,670
I'm a king.
The greatest.

959
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:53,514
Oh, no. We are too late.

960
01:24:07,395 --> 01:24:10,796
Theofil?
-It's Theodor.

961
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:12,986
Theodor,
what happened?

962
01:24:12,987 --> 01:24:15,489
Where are Luke and Lucy?
-I don't know.

963
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:17,060
They went to search
the mine and

964
01:24:17,061 --> 01:24:18,881
and then was this explosion.

965
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:22,817
Toby?
-What is going on?

966
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:27,208
Look, it's Toby.

967
01:24:44,258 --> 01:24:47,790
For me? -No,
don't give me to him.

968
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,064
No, no, no, no.
I'm the king.

969
01:24:50,099 --> 01:24:52,950
I'm the king, I tell you.
No, no, no.

970
01:24:52,951 --> 01:24:58,006
Let me out.
Let me out, please.

971
01:24:58,055 --> 01:25:00,128
Because of yours
heroic actions

972
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:02,876
Dark city is saved.

973
01:25:02,877 --> 01:25:04,526
And in the name
of the governor

974
01:25:04,527 --> 01:25:06,512
I point you,

975
01:25:06,513 --> 01:25:10,705
honorary Texas
Rangers for life.

976
01:25:11,122 --> 01:25:13,802
Lucy and Luke.

977
01:25:13,803 --> 01:25:16,008
Thank you.
Job well done.

978
01:25:22,544 --> 01:25:24,985
Yes.
-Yeah.

979
01:25:31,329 --> 01:25:33,664
Thank you so much,
professor.

980
01:25:33,665 --> 01:25:34,665
If it wasn't for you,

981
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:38,003
we'll be tiny forever.

982
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:43,697
It was absolutely
my pleasure, miss.

983
01:25:43,698 --> 01:25:45,909
And you're very
charming indeed.

984
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:48,850
I wouldn't was ever size.

985
01:25:54,217 --> 01:25:59,338
Problems, brose?
-Well... I just thought

986
01:25:59,339 --> 01:26:01,346
my horse Betty would
come say goodbye.

987
01:26:01,347 --> 01:26:04,459
Probably, you're not
her type after all.

988
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,942
Watch your mouth.

989
01:26:07,553 --> 01:26:10,633
Hey, Missy.
-Missy.

990
01:26:10,634 --> 01:26:14,303
Hi, guys. I'll miss both
of you very much.

991
01:26:14,338 --> 01:26:16,708
Miss you too.

992
01:26:16,709 --> 01:26:20,793
What if I ask you...
-Yes, be honest with us.

993
01:26:20,794 --> 01:26:24,166
Which one of us do you
fancy the most?

994
01:26:24,167 --> 01:26:26,097
Tom here is my fiancé.

995
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:28,090
We will be getting
married soon. -Yeah.

996
01:26:28,091 --> 01:26:31,509
That's right, guys.
-That's fantastic.

997
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:33,821
That is such a great
news to hear.

998
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:39,227
I'm so very happy,
for you both, I mean.

999
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:41,475
Great news, isn't it?
Isn't it fantastic?

1000
01:26:41,476 --> 01:26:43,508
Yeah, yeah.
Fantastic, I know.

1001
01:26:51,986 --> 01:26:54,901
Goodbye.

1002
01:26:56,318 --> 01:26:58,466
All right. Bye.

1003
01:26:58,467 --> 01:27:00,906
Goodbye.

1004
01:27:01,743 --> 01:27:05,605
Cybil, you didn't buy another
vacuum cleaner, did you?

1005
01:27:05,606 --> 01:27:08,054
Better shouldn’t say too much.

1006
01:27:08,055 --> 01:27:12,193
What's in that case?
-What case? Oh, that case?

1007
01:27:12,622 --> 01:27:14,565
Cough medicine.
Cough medicine, yeah.

1008
01:27:14,566 --> 01:27:16,662
That's it.

1009
01:27:18,475 --> 01:27:21,131
Hey, guys.
Look, who is here.

1010
01:27:21,132 --> 01:27:23,514
Oh, Betty. Sweet Betty.

1011
