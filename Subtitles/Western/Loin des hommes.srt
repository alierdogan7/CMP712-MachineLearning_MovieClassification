1
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:40,007
ALGERIA 1954

2
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:24,121
Well?

3
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:30,799
Why do we make history
begin in the year 3000 BC?

4
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:35,331
What first appears at that time?

5
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:41,988
You know this.

6
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,413
We've studied it before.

7
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:49,197
- Salma?
- Tools.

8
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:52,928
No, we already learned
that's the start of prehistory.

9
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:55,528
Two million years ago.

10
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:58,655
Yacine?

11
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:02,113
Writing.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,561
Very good, Yacine.

13
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,190
The invention of writing. In Mesopotamia.

14
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,637
And also...

15
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,955
Children! Pay attention!

16
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:17,504
And also, at the same
time, near here in Egypt.

17
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,038
The Garonne...

18
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,888
The Rhine...

19
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,988
The Loire...

20
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,307
Just a second.

21
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:36,163
- You rode up here by horse?
- The road's blocked off.

22
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:43,196
You're armed?

23
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:50,880
What's wrong?

24
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:54,647
There were over twenty attacks
in the past two days.

25
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:57,061
At the barracks in Berzina.

26
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:59,355
The sentries had their throats slit.

27
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:08,522
And up in the Aurès mountains
they killed a teacher.

28
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:12,330
Hand out the grain and leave.

29
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:20,873
Come back to Tinguit with us
until it blows over.

30
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:25,180
We're all in the same boat.

31
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,028
I don't think so.

32
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:33,746
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:35,621
Here, Madjid.

34
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:38,977
Help yourself.

35
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,080
Two hours from El Ameur to here.

36
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:58,121
Filthy weather, filthy times.

37
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:40,930
- Can we untie him for the tea?
- Yes, of course.

38
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,955
I wouldn't mind some of your stronger stuff.

39
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,955
Where are you heading?

40
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,803
Here.

41
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,571
Here?

42
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,963
- Sleeping here?
- No, I'm off back to El Ameur.

43
00:09:05,362 --> 00:09:06,953
He's staying here.

44
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,955
You have to deliver him to Tinguit.

45
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,930
- He's wanted.
- What?

46
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:36,955
Those are orders.

47
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,580
I'm a teacher, Balducci.

48
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,713
We can't do it. We need
our people to patrol the region.

49
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:45,673
It's getting worse by the day.

50
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,821
You're tough. You'll be back
to teaching in two days.

51
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:54,044
I'm sorry, but we have no choice.

52
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:06,996
- Is he a rebel?
- No, I don't think so.

53
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,163
But, you can never know for sure.

54
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,399
- What has he done?
- He killed a man.

55
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,792
- Who?
- His cousin.

56
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:17,538
A theft, I think.

57
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:19,196
Stolen wheat...

58
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:21,955
In any case, he killed his cousin.

59
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,121
Sliced his throat with a billhook.

60
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:26,746
Like a sheep.

61
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,080
- Does he speak French?
- Not a word.

62
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,913
You're a good man, Balducci, but...

63
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:42,488
I'm not going to do that.

64
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,722
Do what?

65
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:49,163
Take a man to his death.

66
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:52,830
- His trial.
- It's the same thing.

67
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,330
It's simple, Balducci.

68
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,630
I'm not doing it.

69
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:17,596
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

70
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:22,280
Do you have a weapon?
I don't need two.

71
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:25,371
I'm not doing it,
I already told you.

72
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:29,580
My orders were to bring him here.
Now it's up to you.

73
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,709
You have to keep him here tonight.

74
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:39,711
Come on...

75
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,644
No, there's no need.

76
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:45,080
As you want.

77
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,321
One word of advice...

78
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:53,121
Take him there,
or they'll give you trouble.

79
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,705
They don't like you.

80
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:58,825
And they'd love to shut down your school
without any French children.

81
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:00,763
See you.

82
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,913
Come here.

83
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:37,330
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

84
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:58,746
Here.

85
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:11,038
Take this.

86
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:15,996
Drink.

87
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:29,464
Lay this on your forehead.

88
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:51,913
Thank you.

89
00:18:58,246 --> 00:18:59,705
You speak French?

90
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,663
Yes, a little.

91
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,805
I worked on the French farm.

92
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,613
I don't want to talk to the police.

93
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,513
I'm glad you're taking me.

94
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,146
I'm not taking you anywhere
Tomorrow, you're leaving.

95
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,621
Anyone there?

96
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:12,269
Who is it?

97
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:22,080
Is someone there?

98
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:15,013
Wake up!

99
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,246
Come on.

100
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:19,788
Sit over there.

101
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:35,788
- What do you want?
- We're from his village.

102
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,788
Let him leave.

103
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:47,413
- Why do you want him?
- What's it to you?

104
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:50,246
Do you want to go?

105
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,413
Go on! You're free.

106
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:56,846
- Go!
- No, I don't want to.

107
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:58,080
Give him to us!

108
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,955
Go away! This is a school.

109
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,171
Leave now!

110
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,402
He's armed!

111
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,838
Don't make me hurt you.

112
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,713
Go away!

113
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:01,288
We'll be back for you!

114
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,538
You're leaving.

115
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:35,038
You have to be gone,
before they come back.

116
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,038
Go, damnit!

117
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:45,913
Go!

118
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,038
Go on!

119
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:03,413
Walk!

120
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:06,038
You understand?

121
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,330
Get lost!

122
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:12,913
Say something.

123
00:25:13,705 --> 00:25:14,913
Aren't you a man?

124
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,946
If I go, I'm a dead man.

125
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,637
If you stay here you'll be as well.

126
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,163
- Take me to Tinguit.
- No.

127
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,110
It's that way, south.

128
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:38,996
A day away.

129
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,288
Just follow the track.

130
00:26:39,746 --> 00:26:40,746
Wait!

131
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:45,496
Come here.

132
00:27:11,121 --> 00:27:12,830
Taking me to Tinguit?

133
00:27:16,663 --> 00:27:18,788
You know what you risk there?

134
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:28,413
Do you understand?
You'll be taken to court.

135
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,705
You know what awaits you?

136
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:42,413
Eat.

137
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,371
And drink.

138
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:59,238
<i>Children, there will be
no class today</i>

139
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:12,871
Hey, you!

140
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:20,893
Hi, Francis.

141
00:28:21,496 --> 00:28:22,705
René...

142
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:28,565
Did Balducci bring him here?

143
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:30,938
Yes.

144
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:33,943
René's herd was slaughtered.

145
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,871
What has he done?

146
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:43,913
Why?

147
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:50,288
We'll take care of him for you.

148
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:54,371
He didn't slaughter your cattle.
He killed his cousin.

149
00:28:54,455 --> 00:28:57,955
He's the only prisoner.
Leave him to us.

150
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:01,637
I'm sorry for you, René
But it wasn't him.

151
00:29:01,663 --> 00:29:04,367
- You don't care!
- I do.

152
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:09,830
- Afraid to upset your friends?
- It wasn't him, ok?!

153
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:12,995
You don't get it, Daru.
Hand him over.

154
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:14,273
Calm down, René.

155
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,296
Do as we say, damn it!

156
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:17,830
Why do you care?

157
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,921
- Lower the rifle.
- Shut up, Daru!

158
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,830
Damn, René. You're
making me do this.

159
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:27,851
And now you listen!

160
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:30,863
He killed his cousin.

161
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:32,670
What village?

162
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,538
Jizer.

163
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,230
Go and check.

164
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,036
Francis...

165
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:43,580
here.

166
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,399
Now, go.

167
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:48,792
He'll catch up.

168
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:49,888
Go!

169
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,539
I'm sorry about your herd, really.

170
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:34,696
Speed up.

171
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:59,371
They're coming.

172
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:11,163
We can't stay on the track.

173
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:16,663
We'll head to the mountains.

174
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:19,121
- Lower the rifle. I won't hurt you.
- No, lower yours.

175
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:20,788
You're not my enemy.

176
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,413
Lower it and go on your way.

177
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:00,496
It's your fault, you hear?

178
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,839
He died because you're weak!

179
00:39:04,663 --> 00:39:06,538
You have no courage.

180
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,413
You hear?

181
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:11,955
No honour!

182
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:27,930
Take his rifle.

183
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:33,421
And his magazines.

184
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:37,705
No, you keep it.

185
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:44,363
It's not true that I have no courage.

186
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:46,330
Or honour.

187
00:43:56,663 --> 00:44:00,080
We have to return to the abandoned village.

188
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,746
We came that way.

189
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,996
- They might see we're here.
- It's either that or die of cold.

190
00:45:45,788 --> 00:45:47,163
It's condensed milk.

191
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:49,330
Have a little, it's good.

192
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:59,555
I'll leave you tomorrow. You're free.

193
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:03,705
I'll go back to my school.

194
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:08,455
Is Tinguit far?

195
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:10,663
I can't believe you, damn it!

196
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:14,288
Give Tinguit a rest.
Stop talking about it.

197
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:30,580
I'm sorry about all this.

198
00:46:37,663 --> 00:46:40,246
Why did you kill your cousin.

199
00:46:47,413 --> 00:46:49,288
If someone steals my grain.

200
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,288
I die.

201
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,163
My parents die.

202
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:57,591
My brothers...

203
00:46:58,705 --> 00:46:59,913
Your brothers?

204
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:01,246
Yes.

205
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:03,288
They die.

206
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:07,205
So why are they looking for you?

207
00:47:07,455 --> 00:47:12,830
They know that in your village
if someone steals your grain, you die.

208
00:47:16,996 --> 00:47:18,455
My family...

209
00:47:22,788 --> 00:47:26,112
My family can't pay the <i>diya.</i>
The blood money.

210
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:28,788
My cousins must take revenge.

211
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:32,080
That's our custom.

212
00:47:33,205 --> 00:47:35,955
It's the law. You can't escape it.

213
00:47:41,205 --> 00:47:43,288
You can't escape the law?

214
00:47:45,246 --> 00:47:47,705
You want to escape your cousins though.

215
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,538
If my cousin kills me...

216
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,705
My brothers have to get revenge.

217
00:47:58,996 --> 00:48:00,371
They're little.

218
00:48:00,871 --> 00:48:02,496
I'm the oldest son.

219
00:48:04,705 --> 00:48:06,163
I don't want that.

220
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:15,239
If I escape, vengeance
will strike my brothers.

221
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,871
Getting killed by the French
is my only solution.

222
00:48:25,746 --> 00:48:28,288
You made sure they caught you...

223
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,330
You planned it all.

224
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,880
You're the oldest, so
your name's Mohamed?

225
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:51,496
Yes.

226
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:58,330
Do you parents know of your intentions?

227
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,288
That's why I want to go to Tinguit.

228
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,657
Take me to Tinguit.

229
00:50:40,022 --> 00:50:42,246
- Mohamed?
- I'm here.

230
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,671
We have to leave.

231
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:15,330
Here.

232
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:25,415
- What is it? <i>Berouaga?</i>
- Yes, green berouaga.

233
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:27,496
Chew it.

234
00:51:40,205 --> 00:51:41,621
It's not very good.

235
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,746
Bitter...

236
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:51,764
But it'll make you feel better.

237
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:54,371
It's like bread.

238
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:56,371
Almost.

239
00:52:00,663 --> 00:52:01,871
Almost the same.

240
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,163
You don't speak Arabic like a settler.

241
00:52:09,538 --> 00:52:11,578
My parents worked with the Arabs.

242
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,745
Where?

243
00:52:15,288 --> 00:52:16,746
Not far from here.

244
00:52:17,746 --> 00:52:19,121
What did they do?

245
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:34,274
They aren't my cousins.

246
00:53:09,996 --> 00:53:11,413
There's no one else.

247
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,205
He's my old teacher.

248
00:53:29,788 --> 00:53:31,038
He's protecting me...

249
00:53:31,246 --> 00:53:33,455
He has problems with his people.

250
00:53:33,621 --> 00:53:35,830
He's going to hide me in Tinguit.

251
00:53:39,996 --> 00:53:41,580
What do we do with them?

252
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,996
They come with us.

253
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:47,538
They can be useful.

254
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:55,099
Tie them up.

255
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:58,871
Are they going to kill us?

256
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:03,121
I don't know.

257
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,535
The French are in Ait Kermane.

258
00:55:12,621 --> 00:55:16,813
The French are coming.
We're going back to Tamazgha.

259
00:55:26,455 --> 00:55:27,889
Slimane?

260
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:29,581
Slimane!

261
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:39,371
Daru?

262
00:55:39,746 --> 00:55:40,746
You know him?

263
00:55:53,496 --> 00:55:56,107
Four years together
in the infantry during the war.

264
00:55:57,038 --> 00:55:58,871
The whole Italian campaign.

265
00:55:59,746 --> 00:56:01,038
I can't believe it.

266
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,596
It really is you, the settler.

267
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:06,372
"Long live the 3rd regiment."

268
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:08,913
Why are you here, major?

269
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:14,696
And you?
What are you doing?

270
00:56:14,934 --> 00:56:16,280
We must go.

271
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:21,560
Come on, we're leaving.

272
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:24,873
Saddle the horses, hurry.

273
00:56:49,746 --> 00:56:51,413
Promise me you won't escape.

274
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:53,621
I don't want to tie you up.

275
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,746
And certainly not shoot at you.

276
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:03,746
So? What's this about a school?

277
00:58:04,788 --> 00:58:06,663
You're teaching little shepherds
children French?

278
00:58:08,996 --> 00:58:10,538
I teach them to read.

279
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,663
"Our ancestors, the Gauls..."

280
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:15,497
You distribute grain as well?

281
00:58:15,788 --> 00:58:18,746
Yes, I distribute grain as well.

282
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,483
They must like you on the Plateau.

283
00:58:22,705 --> 00:58:24,830
I hope so, why?

284
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,246
You're doing charitable work.

285
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,746
That's what its called, right?

286
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,137
I teach them to read.

287
00:58:38,455 --> 00:58:41,376
And him. Why are you taking care of him.

288
00:58:42,788 --> 00:58:44,663
He was entrusted to me.

289
00:58:45,663 --> 00:58:49,163
- What'll you do with him?
- I don't know.

290
00:59:58,621 --> 01:00:02,428
I never thought I'd see this again... War.

291
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:09,706
- Do you have kids?
- No, I have pupils.

292
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,163
Have you been a teacher for long?

293
01:00:16,121 --> 01:00:17,538
Since the war.

294
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:21,371
- You're happy up there?
- Yes.

295
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:24,413
Hello, major.

296
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,705
Hello, Madjer!

297
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,061
- How are you doing?
- Good.

298
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,961
- And how's your brother?
- Fine, as well.

299
01:00:33,987 --> 01:00:34,987
<i>Madjer!</i>

300
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,996
Excuse me, sir.

301
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:54,830
Nearly every Algerian from our unit
is in the Rebellion now.

302
01:00:55,288 --> 01:00:56,746
Madjer, for example.

303
01:00:57,205 --> 01:00:59,592
Joined after the Setif
massacre happened.

304
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:04,371
You're on the wrong side this time.

305
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,080
I'm not against independence.

306
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,163
Then, join us and fight.

307
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:15,080
I'm fighting in my own way,
by educating my pupils.

308
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:16,496
So they can read.

309
01:01:18,205 --> 01:01:19,871
It's takes a lot more than reading.

310
01:01:21,038 --> 01:01:23,455
- We're throwing you out.
- "You"?

311
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:27,455
It's war. You have to pick a side.

312
01:01:27,705 --> 01:01:28,871
What side?

313
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:33,663
I was born a few kilometer away,
my parents are buried here.

314
01:01:34,746 --> 01:01:35,955
I can't live anywhere else.

315
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:40,892
Daru, I love you like a brother.

316
01:01:41,538 --> 01:01:44,496
But if I have to kill you, I will.

317
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,976
I'll die without knowing
what it's like to make love to a woman.

318
01:02:11,538 --> 01:02:13,627
You've never been with a woman?

319
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:16,371
No.

320
01:02:16,913 --> 01:02:18,205
Really?

321
01:02:19,496 --> 01:02:21,121
I couldn't get married.

322
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:27,830
I can't help you with that.

323
01:02:39,038 --> 01:02:40,745
What's it like?

324
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:44,163
- What?
- Making love to a woman?

325
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:47,580
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

326
01:02:49,413 --> 01:02:50,830
It's...

327
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:53,788
It's something...

328
01:03:00,538 --> 01:03:03,121
I'd have liked to get married.

329
01:03:05,996 --> 01:03:07,746
Are you married?

330
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,955
Yes, I was married.

331
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,038
You got married in Tinguit?

332
01:03:14,788 --> 01:03:16,038
No.

333
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:17,788
In Algiers.

334
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:21,621
At Notre Dame d'Afrique.

335
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:28,246
- You ever been to Algiers?
- No.

336
01:03:33,162 --> 01:03:34,787
It's a beautiful spot...

337
01:03:35,996 --> 01:03:37,705
Uptown.

338
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,767
A large church with a square in front.

339
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:45,913
It overlooks the bay of Algiers.

340
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:54,455
It was windy that day.

341
01:03:55,496 --> 01:03:57,080
A wind from the sea.

342
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:03,955
It was a beautiful wedding.

343
01:04:13,496 --> 01:04:15,288
You're not married anymore?

344
01:04:18,663 --> 01:04:21,138
I lost my wife ten years ago.

345
01:04:22,455 --> 01:04:23,871
May she rest in peace.

346
01:04:28,871 --> 01:04:29,871
Yes.

347
01:05:44,455 --> 01:05:46,080
We have a hostage.

348
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,938
Continue fire and we'll shoot him!

349
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,621
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

350
01:05:53,163 --> 01:05:55,455
Come any closer and we'll kill him!

351
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,142
<i>Show him.</i>

352
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:05,373
<i>We want to see him.</i>

353
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:10,334
<i>Show us your hostage!</i>

354
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:13,288
Show yourself.

355
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:15,621
Walk to the entrance
of the cave and come back.

356
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:16,830
Go on!

357
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:20,382
<i>Show us the hostage!</i>

358
01:06:23,371 --> 01:06:26,365
One step too far and we'll kill you!

359
01:07:21,134 --> 01:07:22,675
Are there many of them?

360
01:07:23,538 --> 01:07:24,512
I couldn't see.

361
01:07:24,538 --> 01:07:25,913
<i>Come out, one by one.</i>

362
01:07:27,038 --> 01:07:29,871
<i>Hands on your heads.
We won't hurt you.</i>

363
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:33,288
<i>You have one minute!</i>

364
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,830
Back off or we'll kill him.

365
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:41,308
Back off to the bottom of the hill.

366
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,749
Are you ok? Are you wounded?

367
01:08:26,298 --> 01:08:28,840
There's another exit at the back.

368
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:28,960
Don't shoot!

369
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:30,502
We surrender.

370
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,194
<i>Show yourselves!</i>

371
01:09:37,496 --> 01:09:38,996
<i>Walk towards us!</i>

372
01:09:43,621 --> 01:09:45,177
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

373
01:09:46,733 --> 01:09:48,108
<i>Hands on your heads!</i>

374
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:50,663
<i>Come forwards.</i>

375
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,955
Hands on your heads!

376
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,788
I'm the hostage!

377
01:10:11,496 --> 01:10:12,496
Don't shoot.

378
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:14,955
I'm the hostage.

379
01:10:15,996 --> 01:10:17,455
He's with me.

380
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:19,387
He's not a rebel!

381
01:10:19,413 --> 01:10:21,155
Hands on your head!

382
01:10:24,038 --> 01:10:25,038
Search them.

383
01:10:32,913 --> 01:10:33,996
They're clean.

384
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,371
Cease fire!

385
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:41,871
Step forwards.

386
01:11:03,246 --> 01:11:07,979
- You killed surrendering soldiers.
- They're not soldiers.

387
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:09,913
Come with me.

388
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:16,830
If the rebels win,
where will you hide?

389
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,142
Lieutenant Le Tallec.

390
01:11:39,913 --> 01:11:42,576
I'm told you're a reserve officer.

391
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,330
Yes.

392
01:11:44,913 --> 01:11:46,413
A major, right?

393
01:11:49,455 --> 01:11:50,455
Am I free?

394
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,538
We checked.

395
01:11:54,246 --> 01:11:57,788
You were given a prisoner, Tuesday.
Is that right?

396
01:11:59,288 --> 01:12:00,455
That's right.

397
01:12:02,246 --> 01:12:03,246
We thought you were dead.

398
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,496
We're going north.
Continuing the clean-up.

399
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:12,121
Go to Berzina. That area has been secured.

400
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:15,205
We have a base camp, one hour away.

401
01:12:15,746 --> 01:12:17,913
Follow the trail, they're
waiting for you there.

402
01:12:18,038 --> 01:12:20,038
Or wait for us here.

403
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:32,987
We found this on him.

404
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:39,642
It's truly bad when veterans turn against you.

405
01:12:41,913 --> 01:12:44,371
You killed men who were surrendering.

406
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:47,163
That's a war crime.

407
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,621
I obey orders.

408
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:57,496
We must eliminate
all terrorist on the Plateau.

409
01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:00,538
Take no prisoners, none.

410
01:13:06,788 --> 01:13:08,038
Is this yours?

411
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,538
You shouldn't have shot.

412
01:13:32,197 --> 01:13:33,822
We'll be heading down that way.

413
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:37,722
That's fine with me.

414
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:45,413
Platoon, let's march!

415
01:14:43,371 --> 01:14:45,496
You want this to happen to you?

416
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:49,038
You'll surrender to them?

417
01:14:51,288 --> 01:14:52,893
You're alive.

418
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,318
We're lucky to be alive!

419
01:14:56,996 --> 01:15:00,288
Your brothers may be dead
or gone but you're alive!

420
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:01,936
Alive!

421
01:15:03,663 --> 01:15:05,788
Alive! You understand?

422
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:49,830
Do you shout at your class like that?

423
01:15:51,455 --> 01:15:52,686
No.

424
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:57,871
Well...

425
01:15:58,121 --> 01:15:59,455
A little.

426
01:16:07,246 --> 01:16:08,955
Now and then.

427
01:16:44,871 --> 01:16:46,288
Where are we?

428
01:16:47,496 --> 01:16:49,121
Berzina.

429
01:16:51,621 --> 01:16:53,080
Why?

430
01:16:56,246 --> 01:16:57,746
You'll see.

431
01:16:58,371 --> 01:16:59,621
You know it?

432
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:03,205
I was born down there.

433
01:17:04,246 --> 01:17:08,705
My parents worked in the valley.
And over there.

434
01:17:09,705 --> 01:17:11,705
Me too, as a child.

435
01:17:12,288 --> 01:17:13,413
Over there?

436
01:17:14,913 --> 01:17:18,913
In the vineyards,
and for the <i>halfah</i> harvest.

437
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:24,038
I've never seen French people harvest halfah.

438
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:27,587
No, they were Spanish.
From Andalusia.

439
01:17:28,663 --> 01:17:31,121
<i>Los caracoles</i>, they called us.

440
01:17:31,673 --> 01:17:33,214
The snails.

441
01:17:35,288 --> 01:17:37,151
It's home on it's back.

442
01:17:41,788 --> 01:17:43,996
For the French we were Arabs.

443
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,663
And now, for the Arabs we are French.

444
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,038
Hello.

445
01:18:32,246 --> 01:18:33,455
<i>Hello.</i>

446
01:18:35,413 --> 01:18:38,580
It's closed. We open in two hours.

447
01:18:42,038 --> 01:18:43,830
Señorita Martínez?

448
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:46,580
Yes. Do I know you?

449
01:18:48,322 --> 01:18:51,277
- Yes.
- I don't remember.

450
01:18:52,413 --> 01:18:53,746
It's been...

451
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,663
about thirty years.

452
01:18:56,913 --> 01:18:58,580
Ancient history.

453
01:19:03,455 --> 01:19:04,705
For him too?

454
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:07,496
Yes, please.

455
01:19:13,913 --> 01:19:15,413
This is Mohamed.

456
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:18,121
- Hello, Mohamed.
- Hello, ma'am.

457
01:19:24,121 --> 01:19:25,413
And...

458
01:19:26,538 --> 01:19:28,311
a girl for him.

459
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:33,205
This is all I have.

460
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:41,174
Can I leave you my rifle, and pay
the rest when I come back?

461
01:19:41,371 --> 01:19:42,830
You're coming back?

462
01:19:44,955 --> 01:19:46,039
Yes.

463
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:49,205
Give me the rifle.

464
01:19:54,163 --> 01:19:56,371
- It's a good one.
- Yes.

465
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,996
Mohamed.

466
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:09,455
Give me your hand.

467
01:20:09,663 --> 01:20:13,330
Don't worry, I retired long ago.

468
01:20:15,521 --> 01:20:16,938
Raphaëlle!

469
01:20:17,538 --> 01:20:19,788
There's a man here for you.

470
01:20:28,163 --> 01:20:29,205
Come.

471
01:21:04,163 --> 01:21:05,371
Coming?

472
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:12,455
No. Thank you.

473
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,830
Yes, come on!

474
01:21:15,455 --> 01:21:18,668
- I'm out of money.
- It's already paid for.

475
01:21:21,246 --> 01:21:22,580
Paid for?

476
01:23:48,538 --> 01:23:50,330
It's been so long...

477
01:24:14,871 --> 01:24:17,746
Alright, we're going to Tinguit.

478
01:24:17,996 --> 01:24:19,288
As planned.

479
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:23,788
Or not?

480
01:24:59,413 --> 01:25:01,163
Are we near Tinguit now?

481
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:04,705
Yes.

482
01:25:06,792 --> 01:25:07,792
Here...

483
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:10,496
This is for you.

484
01:25:13,394 --> 01:25:15,769
I found it myself.

485
01:25:19,111 --> 01:25:20,527
I was eight.

486
01:25:22,496 --> 01:25:24,746
It will bring you luck.

487
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,413
An Arab coin?

488
01:25:33,913 --> 01:25:35,205
Keep it.

489
01:25:40,455 --> 01:25:42,038
Thank you, Mohamed.

490
01:26:37,871 --> 01:26:39,580
That's Tinguit.

491
01:26:41,589 --> 01:26:44,964
The large building on the left
is the police station.

492
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:51,705
And that's the trail leading into the desert.

493
01:26:53,746 --> 01:26:57,513
A day's walk from here
and you'll see the first nomads.

494
01:26:58,163 --> 01:27:01,701
They'll welcome you with open arms.
That's their law.

495
01:27:04,246 --> 01:27:05,246
I can't.

496
01:27:07,538 --> 01:27:11,996
Listen to me, Mohamed.
After that you can do what you want.

497
01:27:12,371 --> 01:27:13,996
If you go to the desert.

498
01:27:14,243 --> 01:27:17,053
I'll say I handed you over to the army...

499
01:27:18,413 --> 01:27:20,038
and that they killed you.

500
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:22,580
There'll be no more revenge.

501
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,163
But you'll live.

502
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:28,455
You have my word.

503
01:27:29,705 --> 01:27:30,705
I can't.

504
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,788
Here.

505
01:27:39,413 --> 01:27:41,413
You'll be able to last a few days.

506
01:27:44,913 --> 01:27:46,413
Mohamed...

507
01:27:47,663 --> 01:27:50,955
Don't surrender.

508
01:27:51,205 --> 01:27:52,246
But...

509
01:27:53,712 --> 01:27:57,899
If you say you handed me
over they'll come for you.

510
01:27:57,955 --> 01:27:59,582
That's my problem.

511
01:28:00,587 --> 01:28:01,787
What's the matter?

512
01:28:02,913 --> 01:28:04,621
Leave, and don't come back.

513
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:06,538
Ever.

514
01:28:16,496 --> 01:28:18,307
Can I call you "Daru"?

515
01:28:24,163 --> 01:28:25,621
Good luck, Daru.

516
01:28:27,986 --> 01:28:31,415
<i>Trust in the Creator.
He will be there for you.</i>

517
01:28:32,861 --> 01:28:36,236
<i>Give to Him.
He will give to you.</i>

518
01:28:38,455 --> 01:28:41,721
<i>Ask Him. He will provide.</i>

519
01:33:06,538 --> 01:33:08,455
Alright, time for class.

520
01:33:19,038 --> 01:33:21,621
- Hello, Meriem.
- Hello, sir.

521
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:24,330
Hello, Madjid.
Hello, Omar.

522
01:33:41,413 --> 01:33:45,121
- Hello, children.
- Hello, sir.

523
01:33:49,038 --> 01:33:52,038
This is my last day with this class.

524
01:33:54,246 --> 01:33:55,955
I have to leave.

525
01:33:57,455 --> 01:33:59,193
You know that.

526
01:34:01,746 --> 01:34:05,205
I'd like this to be a normal school day.

527
01:34:11,788 --> 01:34:13,996
And I'm very proud...

528
01:34:15,121 --> 01:34:17,413
to be your teacher.

529
01:34:35,777 --> 01:34:39,610
<i>The Atlas mountains</i>

530
01:36:34,449 --> 01:36:39,033
FAR FROM MEN

01:37:04,347 --> 01:37:07,338
<i>Based on the short story
