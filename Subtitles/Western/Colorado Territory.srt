Wesley McQueen.

00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:36,900
Sorry, no visitors.
Governor's orders.

6
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,267
But this is his birthday.

7
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,167
I baked him a cake.

8
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:45,267
I've come all the way Kansas
just to see him.

9
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,500
His, uh, Uncle Pluthner
sent him the prayer book.

10
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,067
I knitted him the socks.

11
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,933
We'll see that
he gets them, madam.

12
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:55,267
I wanted to tell Wesley
about his folks

13
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,267
And about the farm.

14
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,633
And, oh, about his horse.

15
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,467
The one he used to ride
when he was a little boy.

16
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,500
You tell him his Uncle Pluthner
has broken him to a buggy now.

17
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,600
And he takes
good care of him.

18
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,833
Yes, ma'am. We'll tell him
about his horse.

19
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,067
Thank you, thank you.

20
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,467
It's a white horse.

21
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,933
A white horse.

22
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,533
Tell him we pray
for him to be set free.

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,367
He's innocent, you know.

24
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,167
Just a mischievous boy.

25
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,333
He never really done
anybody any wrong.

26
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,567
Never done anybody any wrong.

27
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,067

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,767
Eat a piece.

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,133
Mm, not bad.

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,367

35
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,333

It might be poisoned.

I'm listening.

00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,067
She said to tell
you that the white horse

You owe him
more than that.

He's got a big job
set up for you.

It's a promised land, sir,
that's what it is.

109
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,067
My father used to say,

110

"The sun travels west
and so does opportunity."

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,267
My daughter and I, we've left
the past behind us.

112
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,100
Yes, sir, we, uh, had a little
farm back in Georgia.

113
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:44,300
But then, uh, soil was beat out,
crops poor, prices bad.

114
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:47,133
So we sold out everything
we had, lock, stock and barrel.

our household goods

them out ahead of us.

I got two.

180
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,733
The other one got away.

181
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Can you describe him?

182
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh, big fella.

183
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,400
About 6'4", I'd say.

184
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,500
Long hair.

185
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,533
Too bad you missed him.

186
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,333
That sounds like Wes McQueen.

187
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,133
You'd have been $5000 richer.

188
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,333
Looks like I had
an expensive morning.

189
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,067
Where'd he jump you?

190
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,833
About 8 miles back,
right after we left the canyon.

191
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
Come on.

192
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:30,200
I wanna thank you, Mr. Rogers,
for what you did.

193
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,833
You're a brave man.

194
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,633
And if ever you find yourself
up around our way,

195
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,433
The Rancho Del Sol,

196
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
We'd be mighty glad
to see you.

197
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,267
Wouldn't we, Julie Ann?

198
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,933
You'll be most welcome.

199
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:43,433
Goodbye, sir.

200
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,167
Goodbye, sir.

201
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,767
Mister, the way I figure it,

202
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,633
You got quite a reward
coming from Wells Fargo.

203
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,067
Just leave your name and address

204
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,900
And our superintendant'll
get in touch with you.

205
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,700
Thanks, but I'll settle
for a good horse and saddle.

206
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:57,433
You got 'em, mister.

207
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,067
[**]

208
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,100
[**]

209
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:51,933
Howdy.

210
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,700
Howdy.

211
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,500
What do they call
this place?

212
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,067
You're in the Canyon of Death,
mister.

213
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,467
What's that up there?
That?

214
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,067
That's the City of the Moon.

215
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,300
Leastways, that's what
the Injuns call it.

216
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,600
A dead city hanging in space.

217
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,667
How far to Todos Santos?

218
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:15,500
Oh, that's way north of here.

219
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:16,900
Sits in the mountains.

220
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,800
Over the top of that ridge.

221
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,967
You ain't headed
for there, are you?

222
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,267
Why not?

223
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,367
I'll tell you
about Todos Santos, mister.

224
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:29,367
Strictly the back end
of nothing.

225
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,067
The Spaniards moved in first.

226
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,200
Injuns come along
and massacred 'em.

227
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,567
Then the pox come along
and took care of the Injuns.

228
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:42,300
Left nothing but scorpions
and Gila monsters.

229
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,700
Then an earthquake come along
and took care of them.

230
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:48,733
Ain't nobody gone
there since, mister.

231
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,667
Less'n some rattlesnake maybe
got himself lost.

232
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,167
Well, I ain't lost.

233
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:59,233
[**]

234
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,700
[**]

235
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,300
Who are you?

236
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,700
I'll do the asking.

237
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,733
[**]

238
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,133
That's McQueen, all right.

239
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,067
It sure fits the old man's
picture of him.

240
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,467
Glad you got here, McQueen.

241
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,567
We're in old Dave's
setup with you.

242
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,833
I'm Duke Harris.

243
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,400
This is Reno Blake.

244
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,800
Where's the old man?

245
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,500
He stays in Potrero.

246
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,600
How far is that?

247
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,533
About 60 miles.

248
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,167
What do you think
of the hideout?

249
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,833
Looks all right.

250
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,933
It is all right.
I picked it.

251
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,567
Reno's an expert
on hideouts.

252
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,267
Who's boss here?

253
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,667
A debatable issue.

254
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,600
Do you mean physically
or intellectually?

255
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,767
I'll talk to you.

256
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,233
The great Wes McQueen.

257
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,967
Just a big Kansas jay.

258
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:58,133
[**]

259
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:06,300
Reno and I are quartered
in that broken-down hacienda.

260
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:07,633
The girl has a room upstairs.

261
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,233
Anything else with a roof on it?

262
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,467
Well, we reserved
the old Indian kiva for you

263
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,933
If you're not bothered
by ghosts.

264
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:20,567
The tribal council chamber,
Mr. McQueen.

265
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,467
Gathering place
of the medicine men,

266
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:23,467
The seats of the mighty.

267
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,600
No longer occupied.

268
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:26,667
You talk kind of fancy.

269
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,900
Only philosophizing,
Mr. McQueen,

270
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:31,733
On my favorite subject: Doom.

271
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,167
When it's got you marked,
you're already dead.

272
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,700
What's the girl doing here?

273
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,733
You don't have
to worry about her.

274
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
Why not?
She's stupid, McQueen.

275
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,467
She thinks loyalty a virtue.

276
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,633
Reno met her
in an El Paso dance hall.

277
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,233
There was a bit of shooting.

278
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,067
He cleared out to save his hide
and he took her with him.

279
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:52,833
For some obscure reason
she's grateful.

280
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,700
Where do you two fit
in with the old man?

281
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,267
A large payroll
is the bond that unites us.

282
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:02,633
It travels by the Denver
Rio Grande up to Potrero.

283
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,067
A Mr. Wallace,
the railroad conductor,

284
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,200
Will tell us the next date
of shipment.

285
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,800
So the details of execution
are in your hands.

286
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:12,200
Is Wallace in touch
with the old man?

287
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,567
He'll be up to talk
to you on his day off.

288
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:18,900
I'll do my own
talking to the old man.

289
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:19,867
That's all.

290
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:22,900
I take it
I'm dismissed.

291
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,067
And get that girl
out of here.

292
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,267
There are two of you
and one of her, savvy?

293
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,533
To be accurate,
Mr. McQueen,

294
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,067
There are now three
of us and one of her.

295
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,567
Yes, sir.

296
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:42,067
Pickings must be awful
easy back in Kansas,

297
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:46,433
A big jay like McQueen
can get a reputation.

298
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
I didn't see you
tangling with him.

299
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:51,233
What're you looking for,
a punch in the nose?

300
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,233
Well, what'd the big noise
have to say?

301
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,667
Very little.

302
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,067
Colorado, you can start packing.

303
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,667
[**]

304
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,700
What's eating you?

305
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,200
McQueen's orders.

306
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,800
This is to be a bachelor club
from now on.

307
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,967
Why, that overgrown jailbird.

308
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:13,100
He's not boss around here
any more than I am.

309
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,733
He can't come in...
Keep it up, Reno.

310
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,033
You may talk yourself into
winning this argument yet.

311
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,567
You getting tired
of living, Duke?

312
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,733
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

313
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,233
Instead of fighting
with each other,

314
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,067
Why don't you go over
and tangle with him?

315
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:35,600
Yeah.

316
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,633
Trouble is we might
need him for this job.

317
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,267
A rather obvious point.

318
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:45,233
Well, give my regards
to the girls in El Paso.

319
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,233
I ain't there yet.

320
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,167
I'd like to talk
to you, Mr. McQueen.

321
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,367
Help yourself.

322
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,467
Duke tells me
I have to pull out.

323
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,500
That's right.

324
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,200
What if I tell you
I don't want to go?

325
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm telling you,
you do.

326
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:16,567
But I don't wanna
go back to El Paso.

327
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:18,533
Why not?

328
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,700
I've been there.

329
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,067
Look, I don't care
where you go.

330
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,633
I don't want you
around here, see?

331
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,500
Maybe you think
I know too much.

332
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,200
Maybe you're afraid
I'll talk.

333
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,733
Maybe.

334
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,700
Well, if I was you, I'd do
my worrying about Wallace.

335
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:34,700
The conductor?

336
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:37,633
He's the gabby one.

337
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,667
Besides, there's nobody
up here to talk to.

338
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,833
I should think this is where
you'd want me to be.

339
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,867
Look, I ain't so worried
about you,

340
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,767
It's those two sage rats
you're tied up with.

341
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,333
Next thing you know, they'll be
throwing lead over you.

342
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,733
I can handle them.

343
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,433
You're pretty sure
of yourself.

344
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,667
That's right.

345
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,500
Can I stay?

346
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,200
You in love
with this fella Reno?

347
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,333
No.

348
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,600
Then what's
the big attraction?

349
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,633
I like it here.

350
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,067
[SCOFFS]

351
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,267
Look, I'm not hiding out,
if that's what you're thinking.

352
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,933
You ought to understand.

353
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,633
Yon don't wanna go back to jail.

354
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,633
Well, I don't wanna go back
to the dance hall.

355
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,500
That's right.
I didn't like jail,

356
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:18,500
But I did something about it.

357
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:19,900
I busted out.

358
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:22,200
Maybe that's what I'm doing.

359
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,667
All right, we'll give it
a couple of days,

360
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,833
See how it works out.

361
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:32,767
Thanks, Mr. McQueen. Thanks.

362
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Don't worry about your horse.

363
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,467
I'll feed him and water them.

365
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,500
What happened between
you and McQueen?

366
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:03,900
Why'd he let you stay?

367
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,933
Maybe he likes the way
she combs her hair.

368
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,300
Yeah, maybe he does.

369
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,400
She never piled a plate
like that for you, Reno.

370
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:46,933
Leave that there.

371
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:49,633
If he wants to eat,
he can come in and get it.

372
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,267
You want more?

373
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,467
Yeah.

374
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,700
Get it.

375
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,067
You're losing
your grip, Reno.

376
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:02,133
She's looking for trouble.

377
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,967
So are you.

378
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,567
Want some breakfast?

379
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:11,433
Oh, I was wondering
about that.

380
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,400
We don't serve fancy,
but it's hot.

381
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,600
I was trying
to figure you out last night.

382
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,467
Didn't keep you awake,
did it?

383
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,567
Nothing keeps me awake,
Miss, uh...

384
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,067
By the way,
what is your name?

385
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,300
Colorado.

386
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,633
Colorado Carson.

387
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,900
Colorado. You born
in these mountains?

388
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:34,533
My mother.

389
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,900
She was part Pueblo.

390
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:39,333
I guess she was homesick
when she named me.

391
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,867
And your old man?

392
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,067
Boss cowhand down
on the Pecos country.

393
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,367
Grew up there.

394
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,533
Pretty tough place for a kid.

395
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,933
It was all right
as long as Pa was living.

396
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:51,633
After that, it was either
the Comanches

397
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,767
Or the cowpokes.

398
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,633
I don't know which was worse.

399
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,433
You know, "Let's go
look at the moon."

400
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,800
That was on clear nights.

401
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:04,333
Rainy weather it was,
"Let's go inside the barn

402
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,800
And pitch a little hay."

403
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,533
You probably play
that game yourself.

404
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,867
So?

405
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:15,100
After Ma died, I headed
out for San Antone.

406
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,500
Got myself a job
in a Wild West show,

407
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:20,067
Shooting glass balls
with a rifle.

408
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:22,233
Riding broncs.

409
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,233
Broke my leg twice.

410
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,133
Looks pretty straight to me.

411
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,467
Straight enough to get myself
a job dancing the honky tonk.

I ought to sing.

That's when
the shooting started.

00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,267
Next stop, El Paso.

00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,733
No. I think I understand.

Just so you get
one thing straight.

419
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,167
It wasn't Reno brought here.

420
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,667
Maybe it's these mountains.

421
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,467
Maybe there's more of my mother
in me than I thought.

Yeah, and it's too bad they
don't run a train up here,

Because I'm no horseman.

One fellow was smooth, slippery.

The other was green and gabby.

From the top of his head
to his boot heels.

a boxcar of soldiers

Coupled onto that train.

sent word to the soldiers.

00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,933
I... I can't take it, Chet.

709
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:33,900
Why not?

710
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,533
Because I know why
you brought it.

711
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,133
It's on account of Julie Ann.

712
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,500
I know, I know,

713
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:40,800
But it's all on account
of her.

714
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:44,133
You see, there's a little matter
that you don't know about.

715
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,267
About Julie Ann?

716
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,533
Yeah.

717
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,067
I got to be honest
with you, boy.

718
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,533
There's a fella back home,
name of Randolph.

719
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,967
Randolph sells the bell cows
back there.

720
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,633
Martha's in love with him,
is that it?

721
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,433
Martha?

722
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,000
I meant Julie Ann.

723
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,067
I meant Julie Ann.
Well, I don't know.
She still writes to him.

724
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,500
Well, I don't know.
She still writes to him.

725
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,100
They figure
on getting married?

726
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:08,733
No. Randolphs don't marry
with river bottom folks.

727
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,367
You got to live it
to understand it, boy.

728
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,167
That's why you brought
her out here.

729
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:17,333
You can't blame her, boy.

730
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,200
She's not bad,
she's just...

731
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:20,800
Just young, that's all.

732
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:24,333
She sure did want to live up
in that Randolph mansion,

733
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,800
Way up there on the bluff.

734
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:29,967
You know, a girl gets
crazy ideas sometimes.

735
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:33,567
Anyway, I... I sure thank you
for the offer.

736
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:36,267
I'm not giving the money to her.

737
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,433
I'm giving it to you.

738
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,167
You like her, don't you?

739
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,267
Why don't you tell her so?

740
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,100
Maybe you could get that
Randolph fella out of her head.

741
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:51,400
She likes you too.
Yes, she does.

742
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,600
FRED:
Well, look at her, look at her.

743
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,600
She's as cute as a bug's ear.

744
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,800
It fits perfect.

745
00:40:57,867 --> 00:40:59,233
Yeah.

746
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,433
Thank you.

747
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,667
Oh, I'll unsaddle your horse.

748
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,400
You're gonna stay
to supper, aren't you?

749
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:06,467
No, no. I... I can't stay.

750
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,100
I'll be coming back, though.

751
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:10,067
We'd always be glad
to see you, Chet.

752
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,667
Remember you said I never talked
much about myself?

753
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,200
Good reason why.

754
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:17,333
I got another life to get
done with, once and for all.

755
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,067
It won't take but a few days.

756
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,333
Then I'll be back.

757
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,567
We'll be here, Chet.

758
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:24,467
Thank you, Julie Ann.

00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:25,500
Goodbye, Mr. Winslow.

760
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,900
Goodbye, son, goodbye.

761
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,067
You will come again
right soon, won't you?

762
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:36,133
Remember what I said that day
back in the stagecoach?

763
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,533
The Promised Land, I said.
And I was right too.

770
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,367
What happened?

771
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:13,700
Reno.

772
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,500
He went crazy.

773
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,367
Got to drinking with Duke.

774
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:18,500
You know how Duke is.

775
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:20,633
He likes to hurt people.

776
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,133
Took it out on me.

777
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,533
Well, I couldn't stand it
no longer.

778
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,833
I threw a bottle at him.

779
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,633
Yeah.

780
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,967
Reno wasn't any help.

781
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:30,533
He said I'd been
looking for trouble

782
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,933
Ever since you came here.

783
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:33,933
I thought you said
you could handle them.

784
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:35,600
They went crazy,
I tell you.

785
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:38,733
Reno hit me,
then waded in on Duke.

786
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,067
I ran over here
and locked myself in.

787
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,867
Where are they now?

788
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:43,467
Out by the church somewhere.

789
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:45,467
Reno didn't have
his gun on.

790
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,533
Duke did.

791
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,533
Reno had to take
to the dark.

792
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,067
Duke is hunting him out
like a rabbit.

793
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,900
You stay here.

794
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:55,733

805
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:26,567

00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:55,067

and bring it in here tonight.

That's what they called him.

00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:19,567
He's the big scissor-bill

826
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,233

about the payroll.

00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:12,333

She's dead.

It wouldn't have done
no good.

846
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,867
What do you mean?

847
00:47:35,933 --> 00:47:38,067
Marrying her wouldn't
have helped none.

848
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,367
You bust
out of jails maybe,

00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:43,733
Or mud holes like I was in,

850

But you can't
bust out of what you are.

00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,200

00:47:55,567 --> 00:47:57,600
Never got much higher.

00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,500
Anything was a step up.

857
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:03,667
Even getting hit by Reno
was all velvet.

867
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,800
Maybe there won't be
no long pull.

868
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:40,100
Maybe it all ends
Friday on that train.

869
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,400
Yeah.

870
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:44,833
Yeah, that's where it ends.

871
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,333

his own road after that.

874
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:55,833
We're all through then.

875
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,633
WES:
There's the railroad.

876
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,967
There's a good stand of trees

877
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,500
At Pine Flats
you can hide out in

878
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:30,267
Until I signal you
to board the train.

879
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:33,433

you're in on it.

880
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,733
Right?

881
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,100
There's a small bridge
at Luckman's Pass.

882
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:44,400
You wait there
with the extra horses.

883
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:47,467
That gives you just about four
minutes to get that safe open.

884
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:48,633
It'll be open.

885
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,233
I only hope those train guards

886
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,767
Give us an argument.

887
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:53,633

We'll go around and get him.

1410
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,733
Well, he wouldn't let us
in the front door

So we'll go around
the back door and get him.

You made it sound so good

I almost believed it
myself, Grey Eyes.

she'll call him out?
