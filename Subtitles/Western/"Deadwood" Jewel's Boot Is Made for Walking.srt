I'’M THERE BUYING GIRLS

00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:24,093
OR IF YOU'’RE
NEVER GONNA BE ABLE

5
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,487
FARNUM'’S SLITHERED

6
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,529
I DON'’T KNOW.

( laughing )

11
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,862
I WAS GODDAMN THERE.

12
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,367
BUT IT'’LL HELP ME
WALK BETTER.

13
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,126
YES.

14
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,525
FUCK AL.

15
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,947
YOU DRAGGIN'’
YOUR LEG IS YOURS.

16
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,921
DON'’T-- DON'’T
APOLOGIZE TO ME.

17
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,378
LET ME HOLD ONTO
THIS FOR A WHILE.

18
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,880
THANK YOU.

THE FINEST
PHOTOGRAPHIC APPARATUS
MANUFACTURED IN THIS COUNTRY.

22
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,104
IN SERVICE OF
THIS FINE APPARATUS.

23
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,074
OH, GOD!AGH!

00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:22,608
MIGHT UPSET
THE CHILD.

27
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,952
AHA.

28
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,967
I'’LL TELL YOU
ONE THING--

29
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,841
IN MY CAPACITY
AS FIRE MARSHAL.

30
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,790
I TAKE GREAT PLEASURE
IN YOUR COMPANY.

31
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,044
I FEEL THE SAME.

32
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:41,220

OH MY GOODNESS.

35
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,453
I CAN'’T BE...

36
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,712
- HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?
- HOW DO YOU DO?

37
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,054
MYWARD.

38
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,655
AND MY HAT.

00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,032
FINE MANNERS.
( chuckles )

40
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,430
REVEREND SMITH.

41
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,027
UH-HUH.

42
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,541
HOW YOU FEELING?

43
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,046
AS YOU SEE.

44
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,141
- UPRIGHT?
- HE WAS UPRIGHT, YES.

45
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,645
HIS NAME ESCAPES ME.

46
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,111
CERTAIN LINIMENTS
AND...

47
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,118
ARE YOU NOT WELL,
MINISTER?

48
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,970
OR EXCESS OF ENERGY.

49
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,796
BUT YOU'’RE PUTTING
THE TENT DOWN.

50
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:04,807
WHEREVER YOU FIND YOURSELF,
HE WILL SHOW YOU THE PATH.

51
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,597
COULD YOU HELP ME
TO PRAY?

52
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:23,359
LORD,

53
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,004
TO UNDERSTAND
THAN TO BE UNDERSTOOD...

54
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,507
TO LOVE THAN
TO BE LOVED...

55
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,018
AND THE REST
I FORGET.

56
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,289
YEAH, I'’VE NEVER SEEN AL
WARM UP TO ANYBODY SO QUICK.

57
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,753
.
ADAMS IS
THE MAGISTRATE'’S BAGMAN

58
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,149
IN TURN, HIS WARMTH
IS COUNTERFEIT.

59
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,624
FIX ME A CUP
OF COFFEE.

60
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,714
MORNING.

61
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,111
TAKE A TABLE
OUT OF THE TRAFFIC, HUH?

62
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,740
JUST THAT
AFFECTIONATE.

63
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,499
IF NOT, THEY COULD
ALWAYS BE CHANGED.

64
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,002
LET ME FUCKING POUR.

65
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:51,891
HE'’S GOTTA MAKE SOME
DISTANCE BEFORE SUNSET.

66
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,180
I'’M KNOCKED UP.

67
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,106
NO ENVELOPES
AND TO FUCK HIMSELF.

68
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:20,002
- I'’LL KNOW.
- YOU TRAVEL SAFE.

69
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,924
YANKTON.

70
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,522
BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN HERE AND YANKTON.

71
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,445
2,000.

72
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:46,455
I PUT HIM IN A ROOM
ABOVE THE PRIVY.

73
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,775
( chuckles )

74
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,650
UH, ALWAYS A LITTLE
SKETCHY ABOUT ME.

75
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,240
OH, THAT WOULD BE
MY ROOM KEY.  SOPHIA?

76
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,631
- ROOM SEVEN.
- THANK YOU, SIR.

77
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,137
- Sophia: THANK YOU.
- YOU'’RE WELCOME, LITTLE ONE.

78
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,641
OH MY GOODNESS,
WHAT'’S THAT BEHIND YOUR EAR?

79
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,846
DON'’T YOU EVER CLEAN
BEHIND YOUR EAR?

80
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,322
DOES CARING
FOR SOPHIA PLEASE YOU?

81
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,612
AS IT HAPPENS...

82
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,801
YES.

83
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,480
THERE'’S SOME TALK
THAT YOU DID BROM IN.

84
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,319
THEY HAVE RAISED
THE POSSIBILITY.

85
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
BUT HE WOULD VERIFY 
THAT I WASN'’T THERE.

86
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,337
I DIDN'’T MEAN
TO UPSET YOU.

87
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,399
I SUPPOSE HERE,
AS WELL.

88
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,318
IN CERTAIN CIRCLES.

89
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,490
MR. ELLSWORTH
BEING THE EXCEPTION?

90
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,976
NEARLY AS MUCH AS
I'’D LIKE TO WASH.

91
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,813
DADDY.

92
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,782
AH.

93
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,288
I'’M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

94
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,870
I AIN'’T SEEING THE CAMP
BURNED TO THE GROUND.

95
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:16,058
WELL, I'’LL SEND
ONE OF MY BOYS OVER
TO PICK UP THE IRON.

96
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,063
THIS AIN'’T THE GODDAM
N DAY OF JUDGMENT, TOM.

97
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:16,001
WHEN ANY VIOLENCE CREATED
MAYBE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES;

98
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,962
BUT FIT FOR THE CAMP.

99
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:46,398
SHOW IT TO YOU,
WONDER IF YOU'’D PUT IN A WORD?

100
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,290
-( knocks on door )
- YEAH?

101
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,081
COME ON IN.

102
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,089
YOUR HABIT GET THE BEST
OF YOU AWHILE, SON?

103
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,647
OH, THE LEFT EYE'’S PERFECT,
AND THE RIGHT'’S COMING BACK.

104
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,444
BE THAT AS IT MAY...

105
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,784
AHEM, WELL...

106
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:04,059
I MAY BE ABLE TO COME UP
WITH SOME MORE DETAILS.

107
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:11,867
HE SAID TO TELL YOU
WHAT I SEEN.

108
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,487
AND NOW IS HE HOLDING
THE STRINGS ON YOU?

109
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:51,439
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THAT I'’D STOLE HIS PROPERT
Y AND FUCKED HIS ACTION UP.

110
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,029
OR YOU'’LL WISH YOU'’D HAVE
GOT DROWNED IN THAT BATHHOUSE.

111
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,615
ALL RIGHT.

112
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,954
WELCOME BACK, SON.

113
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,461
I-- OR...
YES, I WILL.

114
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,274
JESUS CHRIST.

115
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,459
THAT TOO,
IS-- IS TRUE ENOUGH.

116
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,385
STAPLETON.

117
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,976
LIKE I KNOW ANYBODY
NO MORE.

118
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,279
HE CAN BE SHERIFF
FOR ALL I CARE.

119
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,293
AND NO FUCKING
PAPERWORK.

120
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,663
WELL, I DON'’T EVEN
KNOW IF HE CAN WRITE.

121
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,565
IF HE WAS SWORN IN
UNDER YOUR ROOF.

122
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,194
AWFUL GRATEFUL, AL.

123
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:25,597
AND IF I GOT '’EM,
THEY WOULDN'’T BE APPLIED
TO BUILDING NOTHING.

124
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:32,720
ANYWAYS...
WOULD YOU WANT
A FREE FUCK?

125
00:29:47,402 --> 00:29:50,822
WOULD YOU TAKE IT
FROM ME, FREE?

126
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,379
( door opening )

127
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,776
OH, YES.

128
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,562
WELL, I JUST STOPPED
FOR A MOMENT.

129
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:11,486
OH, YES.

130
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:16,875
- I'’LL LOCK UP.
- OH, YES.

131
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:42,684
KISS MY NECK OR TITS
IF YOU HAVE TO KISS SOMETHING.

132
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:46,187
LET ME KISS YOU.

133
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,524
WELL, YOU'’RE
A GODDAMN JEW FOOL.

134
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,227
ONE, TWO, THREE.

135
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,622
WITHOUT THAT PUTRID APRON
AROUND YOUR MIDSECTION.

136
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,376
- NO.  LET'’S DRINK.
- ( laughs )

137
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,718
OUR HEALTH
COMMISSIONER.

138
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,505
WHISKEY.

139
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,768
YOU WERE AT THE TABLE 
WHEN HICKOK WAS KILLED.

140
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:26,371
MY WIFE AND CHILD ARE
TO JOIN ME FROM MICHIGAN.

141
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:33,378
HE MISSED
THE SWEARING IN TOO.

142
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,020
THEN WHY THE FUCK
DIDN'’T HE COME DOWN?

143
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,447
AT WHOSE MYSTERIOUS
PLEASURE YOU SERVE.

144
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,071
A CANDID MOMENT.

145
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,801
THY CIRCUMCISION
BECOMES UNCIRCUMCISION.

146
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,058
THY... UNCIRCUMCISION...

147
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,993
WHO BY--
BY LETTER AND UH...

148
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,000
YEAH.

149
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,718
I WANT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT THE LAW.
PLEASE, PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT.

150
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:32,974
'’CAUSE YOU'’RE ONE OF THOSE
PAINS IN THE BALLS WHO THINKS
THE LAW CAN BE HONEST.

151
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:35,977
I DON'’T WANT IT.

152
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,814
HELL, I DO LOTS OF THINGS
I DON'’T WANT TO DO.

153
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,629
'’CAUSE MY PARTNER'’S
FUCKING THAT WHORE.

154
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,585
ANYWAY--

155
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,521
HE'’S BACK OPEN.

156
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:28,029
- HOW WAS YOUR 
TALK WITH AL?
- CONGRATULATIONS.

157
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:32,166
GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP,
BULLOCK.

158
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,134
OR PERIL OR SWORD?

159
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,196
I AM PERSUADED THAT...

160
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,070
NOR-- NOR ANGELS,

161
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,222
FROM THE LOVE OF--
OF GOD!

162
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,676
AND--

163
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,179
AND JESUS CHRIST
OUR LORD.

164
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,440
WHO SHOULD BE ABOUT
LOOKING FOR A PLACE.

165
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,916
- VERY WELL.
- I'’M SETH BULLOCK.

166
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,419
MR. BULLOCK.

167
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,925
- HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?
- HOW DO YOU DO?

168
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:16,530
- MY DAUGHTER SAYS THAT
THE DINNER HOUR IS EARLY.
- 6:00 IS FINE.

169
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:25,423
- Sol: YES, SIR.
- REMARKABLE.

170
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,802
HI, DOC.

171
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,788
- ( chuckles ) OKAY.
- SIT DOWN.

172
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,297
EXCEPT THAT
I LEARNED THIS IN LATIN--

173
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,049
HAVING SAID THAT...

174
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,553
AND DIFFERENT FROM THE...

175
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,062
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TRY
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

176
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,401
LET'’S.

177
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,459
SAUCY WORDS, DOC.
GOOD THING YOU'’RE
HANDY WITH THE SNATCH.

178
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,471
SHE'’LL BE KICKING UP
HER HEELS IN NO FUCKING TIME.

179
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,477
I WILL LEAVE YOU NOW
TO PURSUE ANOTHER EXCUSE.

180
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,484
GET THAT JEW
OVER HERE.

181
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,431
WE SHOT HIM.

182
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,197
FRESH BAKED BREAD
AND RHUBARB PIE TO COME.

183
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,086
- YOUR REPAST AWAITS
YOUR MOUTHS.
- THANK YOU.

184
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,517
THANK YOU,
MR. FARNUM.

185
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,438
HE HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT.

186
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,066
AS HER ADVISOR,
I MEAN?

187
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,735
I THOUGHT, BUTTON,
THAT YOU WERE OUR ENTIRE
PREOCCUPATION.

188
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,442
A CHEAT, A BROAD TOSSER
AND A CLIP.

189
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,252
OR SHE'’S HIS PIGEON.

190
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,877
WHEN YOU'’VE GROWN
A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.

191
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:07,381
BRASS, THAT WOULD BE...

192
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:10,884
TO GULL YOUR OWN
FLESH AND BLOOD.

193
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:15,389
( saloon piano playing )

194
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:28,402
- MR. SWEARENGEN.
- YOU OWE ME $5.

195
00:46:30,904 --> 00:46:32,906
IF YOU ASS-FUCKED HER,
YOU OWE ME SEVEN.

196
00:46:39,413 --> 00:46:42,883
- IT WASN'’T TO DO WITH YOU,
IT WASN'’T BUSINESS.
- TRIXIE!

197
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,886
DON'’T THINK
I DON'’T UNDERSTAND.

198
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,825
TRUSTED EACH OTHER
ENOUGH TO TELL HALF
THE FUCKING TRUTH.

199
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,577
EVERYBODY NEEDS THAT.

200
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,031
IT BECOMES
PRECIOUS TO '’EM.

201
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,422
OR SHE PAYS.

202
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,388
FIVE.SEVEN
FOR AN ASS-FUCK.

203
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:42,809
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.

204
00:47:45,312 --> 00:47:47,314
YOU SLEEP TONIGHT
AMONGST YOUR OWN.

205
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:50,817
ANOTHER FUCKING BOTTLE.

206
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,505
AND ARGUED
MORE IMPORTANT MATTERS...

207
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,486
I DIDN'’T KNOW
HIM AT ALL.

208
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,003
MY WIFE AND SON
WILL BE JOINING ME SOON.

209
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,514
THEIR PASSIONS RULE.

210
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,524
OR SECURITY OR THE SECURITY
OF HER HOLDINGS.

211
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,053
I'’M A PRACTICED
AND INVETERATE LIAR.

212
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,060
IF WE DIDN'’T HATE THE
M TOO MUCH TO BE CURIOUS
ABOUT THE WORLD...

213
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,065
WE'’D WONDER WHAT
THEY'’D HAD TO SAY.

214
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,576
HAND THAT STICK TO A CAPTAIN
OF THE FLOATING TABLE, CY.

215
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,380
WITHDRAWN
WITH APOLOGIES.

216
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:24,388
ARE WE THAT FAR WEST
THAT WE'’VE WOUND UP
IN FUCKING CHINA?

217
00:51:04,845 --> 00:51:07,347
LEON, LEON, LEON.

218
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:11,852
THIN IT OUT, LEON.
PRUNE THE PATTER DOWN, HMM?

219
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:27,784
FOR THE JOANIE STUBBS
CONSTRUCTION FUND.

220
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:45,635
MIND IF I SHOW JOANIE
MY PEACOCK, EDDIE?

221
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,655
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW
THAT SHIT'’S GONNA SHAKE OUT.

222
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,665
( cheering )

223
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,138
HE'’S LOOKING
TO ROOT AT HER CLAIM.

224
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:33,600
I GUESS SHE TOLD HIM
WHERE SHE'’D BEEN.

225
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,840
AND I USED POOR
FUCKING JUDGMENT.

226
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,133
COLD ENOUGH WORLD
WITHOUT GETTING GONE AGAINST
BY YOUR OWN.

227
00:53:30,824 --> 00:53:32,325
NOW, HOLD
ONTO THAT, HUH?

228
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:25,011
YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP, HUH?
GIMME THAT!

229
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,021
COME HERE.COME ON.

230
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,530
IS WHERE THIS
WARRANT'’S FROM.

231
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,969
SLOW THE FUCK UP.

232
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,475
BEHIND IT SHE RAN
A WHOREHOUSE, HUH?

233
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,822
NOW, I'’LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING YOU DON'’T KNOW.

234
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,905
( grunting )

235
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,914
JUST SPIT IT OUT.

236
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,922
ANYWAYS.

237
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,684
( Western music playing )

238
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:45,662
? BRING BACK MY HO-CAKE,
YOU LONG-TAILED NANNY-O ?

239
00:57:56,673 --> 00:58:01,177
? BRING BACK MY HO-CAKE,
YOU LONG-TAILED NANNY-O ?

240
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:18,695
? BRING BACK MY HO-CAKE,
YOU LONG TAILED NANNY-O. ?
