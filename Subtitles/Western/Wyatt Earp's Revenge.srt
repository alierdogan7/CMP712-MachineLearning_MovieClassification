1
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,006
Howdy.

2
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,850
You got any feed?

3
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,802
I got oats and apples, five cent.

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,403
Water's free, though.

5
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,645
Coming down from Dodge City?

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,840
What's that?

7
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,766
I just said, you heading down
from Dodge City?

8
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,331
Why?

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,206
Why what, mister?

10
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,727
Why's it matter where I'm going
or coming from?

11
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,524
I guess it don't.

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,250
That's right, it don't.

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,086
Look, I'm not looking to start
any trouble.

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,609
That horse is sweating up a storm.

15
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,207
So help yourself, as much as you like.

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,922
You a gambling man?

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,445
No, sir, I am a Christian man.

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,890
Christian man, huh?

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,528
Being a Christian man...

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,562
...you believe in fate or choice?

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,450
I believe in whatever the good Lord
has planned.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,969
Let's make it choice, then.

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,526
Pick a number between one and 10.

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,961
- Why are you doing this?
- Pick a number.

25
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,645
- This isn't necessary...
- Pick.

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,847
- Why?
- Pick a number.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,411
- Why?
- Pick a number.

28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,690
Three. No, five.

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,650
Five?

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,766
No!

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,371
Wrong number.

32
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,601
May I help you?

33
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,411
Excuse me. I have a meeting
with a Mr. Wyatt Earp.

34
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,450
- Could you kindly tell me...?
- Just one moment.

35
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,682
He checked in.
Would you like his room?

36
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,808
No, no. He's expecting me.

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,610
- He's in room...?
- Dover Suite.

38
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,411
Dover Suite. Thank you.

39
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,162
- Good day.
- Good day.

40
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,324
Mr. Earp?

41
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,765
Excuse me, sir?

42
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,361
Mr. Earp?

43
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,764
My name is Conrad Taylor.
I'm with the Kansas City Star.

44
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,721
I believe we had an appointment
today, did we not, sir?

45
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,043
I travelled along distance
to meet with you, sir.

46
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,488
All the way from Kansas, no less.
Three days' journey.

47
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,450
Mr. Earp?

48
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,722
Care for a drink, Mr. Taylor?

49
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,526
Truly appreciate this, sir.

50
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,690
Thank you.

51
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,444
In my research,
I found that four Army revolvers...

52
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,524
...were manufactured by Colt
and presented to you...

53
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,163
...Mr. Charles Bassett, Bat Masterson
and Bill Tilghman in the year of...

54
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,481
'78.

55
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,044
Yes, 1878...

56
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,645
...but there's no mention...

57
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,202
...of why you were presented
with such generous gifts.

58
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,961
Our readership
would be interested to know...

59
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,804
...if such an item exists.

60
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,609
I'll have to be frank, sir.

61
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,242
It's been widely speculated
that its existence is merely a myth.

62
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,287
It's no myth, Mr. Taylor.

63
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,964
Then it's true.

64
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,410
Yet its significance has remained
undocumented. Why?

65
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,367
Its significance is before you, sir.

66
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,081
"The slaying of actress Dora Hand."

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,325
I remember reading about this.

68
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,721
She graced many small stages
in the West...

69
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,645
...until she was gunned down
by Spike Kenedy.

70
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,167
But I still don't understand why.

71
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,087
Could not know why.

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,170
You did not know her. I did.

73
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,286
She performed that night...

74
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,681
...and she was amazing.

75
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,724
<i>I cared for her.</i>

76
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,721
<i>More than she knew.</i>

77
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,167
<i>I wish I had told her.</i>

78
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,724
Listen to them. They're off their chairs
again. Shall we go back out?

79
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,123
Leave them wanting more.
See the cute boy in the third row?

80
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,889
Excuse yourself, please.

81
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,123
I can hardly forget you have
an admirer. A lawman, no less.

82
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,250
Have you spent any time away
during this engagement?

83
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,243
Hi. Have fun.

84
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,529
He's the only reason
we're entertaining this town.

85
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,364
Third time since the summer.

86
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,330
- Perhaps the last.
- Don't know what to tell your father.

87
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,482
Tell him nothing,
as you've been doing.

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,005
We're going home tomorrow.
Tell him nothing yourself.

89
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,924
<i>For those two young actresses, one
night, it would change everything.</i>

90
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,721
Sam, you ride ahead and signal me
when you're in position.

91
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,524
<i>Mayor Kelly's a dead man
for what he's done.</i>

92
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,891
Son of a bitch, Kelly!
You got it coming!

93
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,930
Goto hell!

94
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,481
<i>What a horrific turn of events.</i>

95
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,007
It was at that.

96
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,170
To understand why, Mr. Taylor,
you have to understand...

97
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,005
...the War Between the States.

98
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,610
The war formed us...

99
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,242
<i>...made us who we are.</i>

100
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,170
After killing your own cousins,
your own brothers...

101
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,369
...killing strangers meant nothing.

102
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,049
<i>Lawless times followed
those long, dark years...</i>

103
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,001
<i>...and Dodge City seemed
to be at the centre of it.</i>

104
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,764
<i>Men who sought to escape that...</i>

105
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,721
...would sooner kill any lawman
who come after him...

106
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,521
<i>...knowing surrender
meant a walk to the end of that rope.</i>

107
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,601
<i>Spike, he was no different.</i>

108
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,126
<i>After a while,
no one would come after them...</i>

109
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,807
<i>...and men like Spike Kenedy
would do whatever...</i>

110
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,524
...they want to anyone...

111
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,648
...and not answer for it.

112
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,050
But Dora wasn't just anyone.

113
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,048
The course of that one bullet
changed because of a nail in the bed.

114
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,929
One bullet, one nail on the bed.

115
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,844
Was that fate?

116
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,689
I don't know.

117
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,049
She said they were asleep.
What kind of man would do this?

118
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,645
Where's Kelly?

119
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,168
He's at the hospital at Fort Dodge.
He's sick.

120
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,847
He let these two actresses stay
at his place while he was recovering.

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,446
Didn't know he was
taking in boarders.

122
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Four shots mostly into the walls.

123
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,049
And this one...

124
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,967
Rider never dismounted.

125
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,729
Well, how do you know that?
Shots look pretty well scattered.

126
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,130
Could've been two shooters
and they fled away real quick.

127
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,885
Grab the other end of this.

128
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,961
Number one.

129
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,243
Number two.

130
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,123
Number three.

131
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,766
Number four?

132
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,962
Number four.

133
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,724
Ricochet.

134
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,089
Looks like fate played his part.

135
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,849
One gun, one rider on horseback.

136
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,482
Clever work, Wyatt.

137
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,447
I do believe you're right.

138
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,970
<i>My father, he was a constable
back in Monmouth, Illinois.</i>

139
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,646
<i>He went on to fight
when the time came.</i>

140
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,125
<i>Wasn't around that much after that.
Been a lawman since I was 16.</i>

141
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,444
<i>My father leaving taught me
about doing the right thing...</i>

142
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,841
<i>...even when others don't.</i>

143
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,368
<i>I promised I would protect those
who couldn't protect themselves...</i>

144
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,526
<i>...women, children,
and make it right when they are not.</i>

145
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,529
Caulk marks.
Unique enough to track them.

146
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,721
Any thoughts on the kind of pony?

147
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,408
Two horses.
This impression's deep.

148
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,161
One was a large breed.
The other, I'm not sure.

149
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,084
.44 Winchester Centerfire.

150
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,884
One was a lookout
and ran off in this direction.

151
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,084
South.

152
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,164
Anyone see anything?

153
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,325
Marshal?

154
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,369
Marshal, Spike Kenedy was around.

155
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,721
Spike.

156
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,804
His brother Sam too.

157
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,169
Mad on account of mayor
throwing them out of The Alhambra.

158
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,926
Swore they'd cut down Kelly
for interfering.

159
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,161
Interfering?

160
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,322
Happened yesterday.

161
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,529
Spike planned to rob the new
Wells centre. Kelly overheard.

162
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,650
Throwed them out
before he got sick.

163
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,962
- Ain't gonna let him get away.
- I'll ask Hinkle for a warrant.

164
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,206
Yeah, and I'll get word to Bat. Meet me
back here as soon as you can.

165
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,607
Oh, and put two men
on Mayor Kelly's room, will you?

166
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,765
Will do.

167
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,761
Here he comes.

168
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,408
- So?
- Kelly's alive.

169
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,800
Impossible.

170
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,851
Mayor was in the hospital.
Had some actresses in his house.

171
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,446
- What actresses?
- One of them Dora Hand?

172
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,365
- That's the name.
- Damn, Spike.

173
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,642
Look, boys, the marshal's
putting a posse together.

174
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,845
That'll be Earp and Bassett.

175
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,241
- Wyatt Earp.
- We gotta go.

176
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,288
Now!

177
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,805
Come on.

178
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,450
Let go or I swear I'll kill you.

179
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,445
Wyatt, he broke my thumb.
Tell him to let go.

180
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,647
Wyatt, he broke my thumb.

181
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,371
Bat Masterson, you causing trouble
with my sheriff?

182
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,650
- Sheriff? Son of a...
- I wouldn't dream of it, Marshal Earp.

183
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,970
This gentleman wouldn't
take care of his tab at the saloon.

184
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,567
- I paid my tab, Wyatt. I did, I paid it.
- Yeah, right.

185
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,847
Now, you pay that pretty lady.

186
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,681
Now, what's this I hear about
an emergency town meeting?

187
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,368
Well, thank you, Bat.
I'll tell you along the way.

188
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,131
Wyatt, Charlie, what's going on?

189
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,250
What's this I hear about
you boys putting together a posse?

190
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,131
We need a warrant
for the arrest of Spike Kenedy.

191
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,203
- Denied.
- If he gets out of Kansas...

192
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,931
- ...he may well escape justice.
- Request denied.

193
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,880
His political influences reach far.
Please tell me you're not swayed.

194
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,884
You are nearing contempt, Earp
Mind your talk.

195
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,408
Sir, an actress was killed last night.

196
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,610
I will not permit a vigilante with or
without badges, you understand me?

197
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,606
We will convene in my court
and properly hear all the evidence.

198
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,842
While Spike Kenedy gets away?

199
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,483
Now, you have the authority to issue
an immediate warrant for his arrest.

200
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,329
Yet you fear retribution
from his father.

201
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,803
Now, if indeed
you did sought justice...

202
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,406
...you'd allow us to go
without hesitation.

203
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,369
Traverse lightly here, Wyatt.

204
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,727
Heed a wise friend's words, Earp.

205
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,887
As marshal, I'm ordering you to stay.

206
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,286
Then I ride alone.

207
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,604
<i>I had to go after him.
There was no choice in it for me.</i>

208
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,091
With all due respect, sir.

209
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,687
I ain't gonna let Spike Kenedy
get away.

210
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,209
I'm gonna go with.

211
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,569
You boys ride out there,
you do so without your stars.

212
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,530
You will have no protection
as officers, you understand?

213
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,767
- Wyatt, if you're going...
- You don't wanna come, then don't.

214
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,920
But Dora deserves better from me.

215
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,765
Think about your actions
here today, Earp.

216
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,369
May cost you your career. All of you.

217
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,090
Well...

218
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,331
...there goes my bid
for governorship.

219
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,330
Sorry, judge...

220
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,369
I'll get the horses.

221
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,561
There's nothing to think about, sir.

222
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,925
You boys leave me no choice...

223
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,845
...but to issue warrants
for yourselves as well.

224
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,365
Do what you must, judge.

225
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,090
You ain't back in three days...

226
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,404
...I'm sending federal marshals
after you, you understand?

227
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,130
Yes, sir.

228
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,245
All right, boys.

229
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,442
Most everyone knew
who Spike Kenedy <i>was...</i>

230
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,047
<i>...and his brother Sam.
Desperate men?</i>

231
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,171
<i>Desperate in the sense that they would
stop at nothing to escape justice.</i>

232
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,360
<i>From a military family. Their father,
Captain Mifflin Kenedy, had influence.</i>

233
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,091
<i>Wealth, political power.</i>

234
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,846
<i>It was known he was corrupt...</i>

235
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,128
<i>...but couldn't be touched.</i>

236
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,569
But even with Daddy's connections...

237
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,445
...they would not likely elude us
for long.

238
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,088
Heading southbound,
there was only one place to run.

239
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,079
That was the Mexican border.

240
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,568
<i>Out of the country,
they would lay low...</i>

241
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,247
<i>...while their father would deny
knowledge of their whereabouts...</i>

242
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
<i>...muddle the legal system,
call on favours...</i>

243
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,327
<i>...buy injunctions and the like.</i>

244
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,084
<i>And they'd likely kill again.</i>

245
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,004
You know what to do. Get the boys.

246
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,322
- Oak Hill?
- High noon tomorrow.

247
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,527
Good luck, brother.

248
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,125
Come on.

249
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,566
<i>We had only three days.</i>

250
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,088
<i>Three days or they'd get away
with what they did to Dora...</i>

251
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,891
<i>...before the law would be coming
on our heels.</i>

252
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,530
<i>No authority.</i>

253
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,011
<i>No badges.</i>

254
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,243
<i>No warrant. Just three men.</i>

255
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,969
<i>But we needed a fourth.</i>

256
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,810
- We're gonna need a hand.
- Who do you have in mind?

257
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,440
Remember Billy Tilghman
from buffalo country?

258
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,045
Hang on there, Wyatt.

259
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,362
Spike and the gang
are getting further away.

260
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,363
We lose them, we'll never find them.

261
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,320
- But with a tracker like Bill...
- Spike will never shake us.

262
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,602
<i>After the war, Bat and myself
had taken to hunting buffalo...</i>

263
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,446
<i>...and we met this kid out there
by the name of Billy Tilghman.</i>

264
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,482
Best tracker I ever known.

265
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,722
Was fast with a gun too.

266
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,484
He never wasted a bullet.

267
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,049
Killed over 2,000 buffalo in one day.

268
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,688
Shot so fast, he had to keep his gun
cool by pouring ladles of water on it.

269
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,606
Now, Billy Tilghman
was raised by Cheyenne.

270
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,290
Thought like them, was one of them.

271
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,003
When he tracked...

272
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,363
...he was invisible.

273
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,122
<i>Like a ghost.</i>

274
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,801
Why are we stopping, Wyatt?
Reservation's on that side of the hill.

275
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,966
See all this?

276
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,248
- Yeah.
- It's a warning.

277
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,370
We're gonna find ourselves
at the mercy of a warrior chief.

278
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,851
That so?

279
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,690
Wyatt!

280
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,124
Easy there, boys.

281
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,520
That there's Bill Tilghman,
the one I was telling you about.

282
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,203
- Glad to see you, Bill!
- Wyatt.

283
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,531
Looks like you boys
got yourself a posse down there.

284
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,889
Sure could use some tracking skills.

285
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,806
Spike was the leader. Getting him
would be cutting the head off a snake.

286
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,681
But if we got to Sam first,
I knew he'd come right to us.

287
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,366
- Did you have an idea where to look?
- I had ideas.

288
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,605
Men as notorious as the Kenedy
brothers couldn't just go anywhere.

289
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,481
<i>But as it turned out, Spike had come
upon a little cabin up in the pineys.</i>

290
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,008
<i>They were kind folk
just trying to do a kind thing.</i>

291
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,486
<i>They didn't know a snake
was at the door.</i>

292
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,361
- Howdy.
- Howdy, mister.

293
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,646
Where you headed?

294
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,846
Heading south, end of this road.

295
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,688
Ain't nothing for miles.

296
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,205
What's your name, son?

297
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,808
Connie. What's yours?

298
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,369
- Name's Jim.
- You know, he's right.

299
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,967
It's about 10 miles to town.
Be dark before you got there.

300
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,811
Ten miles, huh?

301
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,480
That is pretty far.

302
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,084
Been riding all day
and my horse is pretty tired. You...

303
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,881
Maybe a place around here
I could set up camp?

304
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,883
It gets pretty cold here at night.

305
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,207
More than welcome to stay with us
if you'd like. Be happy to have you.

306
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,886
I don't really think that we can.
I mean...

307
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,725
No, I couldn't.
I wouldn't wanna intrude on y'all.

308
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,370
Oh, no, you're not intruding.

309
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,409
Look, a man needs some supper.

310
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
Much obliged, ma'am.

311
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,764
- You wanna go grab this man's horse?
- Yeah.

312
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,485
Here you go.

313
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,449
Name's Whisky.

314
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,171
Go on.

315
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,203
- What's your name?
- Jim. My name's Jim.

316
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,930
Jim, nice to meet you. I'm Ed.

317
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,084
You met my boy Connie
and that's my wife Susie.

318
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,562
She's a mighty fine cook
so you'll be well taken care of tonight.

319
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,201
Again, I appreciate it, Ed.

320
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,082
Looked pretty good
throwing that baseball.

321
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,765
Thank you.

322
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,682
Those are real, mister?

323
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,931
We don't allow guns
in the house, Jim.

324
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,923
I hope you understand.

325
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,122
I understand.

326
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,009
Saddlebags be all right?

327
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,321
Yeah, be just fine.

328
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,051
Be a nice meal waiting for you
when you get back.

329
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,326
Mr. Jim's our houseguest. You're not
gonna go bothering him, understand?

330
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,007
- Yes, sir.
- Connie, guns are dangerous.

331
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,844
You understand?

332
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,962
Okay. Go help your mother.

333
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,165
He's putting the guns away.

334
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,121
I just don't understand
why he has to stay.

335
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,248
Why can't he leave after supper?

336
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,721
It's our Christian duty.

337
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,281
It's not the well-off that needs help,
it's Jim.

338
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,091
There's just something about him.

339
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,921
Supper's just about ready, Jim.
Sit down.

340
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,641
Very Christian of you, Ed.

341
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,164
But you stayed on the pursuit.

342
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,687
Did you not say you had some idea
where he was?

343
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,287
Bill was an expert. But by day's end,
we hadn't caught up with him.

344
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,091
Bill had his trail.

345
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,999
Just a matter of time,
but time was running out.

346
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,529
<i>We wouldn't give up. Not allow that.</i>

347
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,008
What is it, Bill? You see anything?

348
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,721
Must've made camp.

349
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,926
Too smart to light a fire too.

350
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,728
Running these horses into the ground
isn't gonna do us any good.

351
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,087
We ought to make camp ourselves.

352
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,489
We'll get him in the morning.

353
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,288
Connie, Ed, dinner's ready.

354
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,240
Dad, can I sit by Mr. Jim?

355
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,289
Oh, that's fine, son.

356
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,649
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, man, that looks good.

357
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,209
Thank you.

358
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,766
Shall we say grace?

359
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,687
Hon, maybe Mr. Jim
wants to say grace.

360
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,365
He's our guest.

361
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,204
Any fine Christian would.

362
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,930
Close your eyes.

363
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,002
Lord, we thank you for this bounty,
for our breath this day...

364
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,401
...for our loved ones,
our brothers, our sisters, mothers.

365
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,723
Most of all, for the hospitality
of these kind people.

366
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,848
And my grandma and grandpa.

367
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,525
And Grandma and Grandpa.

368
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
And my new baby brother.

369
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,967
And new baby brother on the way.

370
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,766
- Amen.
- Amen.

371
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,403
This looks delicious.

372
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,722
Jim, where'd you say
you were headed?

373
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,291
Ranch near Meade.

374
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,483
There's beautiful country up there.

375
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,123
I used to fish at Ryan's Stream
back before the war.

376
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,241
Which ranch? Maybe I know it.

377
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,245
I don't think so.

378
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,765
Try me.

379
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,643
Just a friend's, Ed.

380
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,523
A long journey, I imagine.

381
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,730
- What's that?
- To Meade, to your friend's ranch.

382
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,449
Where you coming from?

383
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,846
My wife asked you a question, Jim.

384
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,170
Coming from Dodge City, ma'am.

385
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,808
What were you doing in Dodge?

386
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,684
Well, I gone to see a show...

387
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,766
...at the Comique Theater.

388
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,282
Did you see what I did
with the Dodge City Times?

389
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,240
I picked one up in Fowler today.
I like to read the reviews of the shows.

390
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,006
I don't get out to see plays
and such, so...

391
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,451
- No, I haven't.
- No.

392
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,126
Probably used it as kindling anyway.

393
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,207
Is it good? Like it?

394
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,329
We're gonna make it right...

395
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,762
...what he did to that poor girl.

396
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,008
There's more, isn't there?

397
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,610
You were familiar
with the pretty little flower.

398
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,246
You know, all my life...

399
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,086
...all I ever wanted to be
was a lawman like my father.

400
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,321
Then Dora came along.

401
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,926
And the way she moved on stage...

402
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,563
...the way she laughed...

403
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,722
...the way the sun hit her face
first thing in the morning...

404
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,690
...everything I thought I was
just changed.

405
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,320
You know,
for the first time in my life...

406
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,759
...all I wanted to be
was a regular man.

407
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,051
<i>A family man maybe. I don't know.</i>

408
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,809
This is it.

409
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,806
This is what you wanted
to show me?

410
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,925
I don't see anything.

411
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,649
This is four lots.

412
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,201
I bought them from Mayor Kelly
back in November.

413
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,522
Pay the other half in the spring.

414
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,165
Build a nice little something
overlooks all this.

415
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,726
It's lovely.

416
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,047
You know, location's everything.

417
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,964
There's a brook nearby.

418
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,043
I was thinking
maybe we make an evening of it.

419
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,170
I know a great spot
to watch the sunset.

420
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,121
I'll show it to you next week.

421
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,490
Did I tell you about the time...

422
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,530
...when I rode in a gondola
in Venice, Italy?

423
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,966
I am so clumsy.

424
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,284
I got in and I completely
turned the thing over.

425
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,566
You went in.

426
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,721
Completely.

427
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,044
It's getting cold.
Maybe we should head back.

428
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,964
No. Let's stay.

429
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,284
I'll be tough.

430
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,771
Just like you.

431
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,169
Maybe I'll light us a fire then.

432
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,485
All right.

433
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,531
<i>I was gonna give up this life
for good.</i>

434
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,562
<i>This damn duty.</i>

435
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,290
Wyatt?

436
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,565
What's wrong?

437
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,400
Someone's been murdered.

438
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,368
They want justice.

439
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,128
- They need me.
- Always with your duty to do.

440
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,764
You're going to go after a man.

441
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,046
You're going to kill him.

442
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,801
Thou shall not kill, Wyatt.

443
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,169
I'm sorry.

444
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,724
If you go...

445
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,722
...I cannot promise I'll be here
when you return.

446
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,971
That's why she was at Kelly's.

447
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,769
Maybe if I wasn't
so damn stubborn, ma...

448
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,967
You know, a feeling like this
only comes once in a lifetime...

449
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,403
...if you're lucky.

450
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,327
And Dora showed me that.

451
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,051
It's quite a thing to care for somebody
in such a way...

452
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,048
...with your whole being...

453
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,170
...heart and soul.

454
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,086
There was a part of me that thought
if I had taken her in my arms...

455
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,767
...and been with her that night instead
of out there chasing some fugitive...

456
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,364
...I hope she'd forgive me,
maybe we'd still be together.

457
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,088
Maybe you wouldn't be here
listening to me tell this story.

458
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,366
- May not be here at all, I reckon.
- You made a choice.

459
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,043
We cannot change our choices,
I suppose.

460
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,806
Well, you tell me, Mr. Taylor.

461
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,568
Was it destiny or fate
or blind chance...

462
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,929
...that takes our loved ones away?

463
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,804
I don't know.

464
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,485
Where's my choice in all this?

465
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,841
None of us can change the past...

466
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,360
...I suppose.

467
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,409
I reckon.

468
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,250
Susie.

469
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,641
You seem to know
what happened in this place.

470
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,643
Some things I heard later.

471
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,968
Some I figured on my own.

472
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,449
When did you finally
come after him?

473
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,604
When it was still dark,
we put our things together.

474
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,841
We set out early.

475
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,965
<i>Forty-eight hours
would go by right quick.</i>

476
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,759
<i>I didn't care for rest, but the horses,
we wouldn't get too far without them.</i>

477
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,810
So I'm riding, I got 10
Cherokee Indians on my tail.

478
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,406
I got arrows flying by.
I stand up on my horse...

479
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,804
...and the stirrups flip around, bring
out my nickel-plated six-shooters“.

480
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,850
Never had a problem
with an Indian after that, Connie.

481
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,731
That was an amazing story,
wasn't it, Pa?

482
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,885
- That was amazing.
- It's a true story, son.

483
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,441
I got some errands to run
out in Ford County.

484
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,762
I could take you as far
as the county line.

485
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,002
Yeah, that'd be fine, Ed.

486
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,561
This was a nice breakfast, ma'am.

487
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,480
You get enough to eat?
Okay, good.

488
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,211
You know, Ed, I'd like to get some oats
for my horse before I ride out.

489
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,601
You wanna show Mr. Jim
where the oats are?

490
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,331
Sure. Right this way, Mr. Jim.

491
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,211
- Attaboy.
- Thanks, buddy.

492
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,365
- Where we headed?
- To the back of the corral.

493
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,443
All right, you lead the way.

494
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,523
Jim's a nice fellow, huh?

495
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,005
Jim. Nice fellow.

496
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,890
- Can I help you with anything?
- No. I'm fine.

497
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,450
Seem pretty happy about having
another young'un coming.

498
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,125
I guess.

499
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,370
Let me tell you something.

500
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,967
Ain't nobody better than kin.

501
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,441
People will come and go,
you can't trust them.

502
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,171
But kin? That's forever.

503
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,209
I got a kid brother myself.

504
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,567
We stand by each other
no matter what.

505
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,484
No one else will do that for you.

506
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,890
You never forget it.

507
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,205
All right.

508
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,321
You wanna hold it?

509
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,005
Can I?

510
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,487
Got a better idea.

511
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,085
This one's yours.

512
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,366
A gift from me to you.

513
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,724
All right, now keep it just like this,
see?

514
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,610
No one will know you have it.

515
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,368
When you need to protect yourself or
someone you care about, you're ready.

516
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,124
You understand?

517
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,004
Here you go.

518
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,001
Hey!

519
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,924
The thing's loaded.

520
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,242
Let me show you
how to shoot that thing.

521
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,284
You ever fire a gun before?

522
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,965
All right...

523
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,327
...put your gun in here.

524
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,687
Point where you want
the bullet to go.

525
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,966
You can't go with him.

526
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,202
I'm gonna make sure he's far away.

527
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,606
And then we get the sheriff.
But until then, don't say a word.

528
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,925
Now aim for that,
right in the middle right there.

529
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,921
Okay? Go ahead now.
Let's see what you got.

530
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,921
That's a great shot. That was fun,
wasn't it? Let's do it again.

531
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,243
Connie! What are you doing?
Stop it!

532
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,801
Are you okay?
You're not to play with guns.

533
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,124
You know you're not supposed
to play with guns. Get in the house.

534
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,527
Just giving the boy
a little education, Ed.

535
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,842
I give the boy all the education
he needs.

536
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,451
We need to go. I got a lot to do.

537
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,204
Ready when you are.

538
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,362
This is where we part ways.

539
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,811
Appreciate your hospitality, Ed.

540
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,966
And that pretty little wife of yours.

541
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,881
You ever come back, I'll kill you.

542
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,845
Wyatt.

543
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,806
Whoa, Ed.

544
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,530
I need you to pick a number
between one and 10.

545
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,444
I don't wanna pick it for you.

546
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,650
Can't choose another man's destiny.

547
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,484
So, what's it gonna be?

548
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,806
Fine. One, two...

549
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,564
Nine.

550
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,241
Nine?

551
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,525
Why nine?

552
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,644
My son's 9.

553
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,042
That's a good kid, that Connie.

554
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,760
Go on.

555
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,681
Come here.

556
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,320
Come on. Come on.

557
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,045
Ed...

558
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,608
My husband! He's been shot.

559
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,930
You riding with him too?

560
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,085
I'm a marshal. My name's Wyatt Earp.
Out of Dodge City.

561
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,926
We're lawmen and we ain't gonna
hurt you, son. Tell me who did this.

562
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,651
Said his name was Jim.

563
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,250
We're after him for what he's done
in Dodge City...

564
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,243
...and I promise you he will pay.

565
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,121
- I wanna come with you.
- No, Connie, no.

566
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,650
I wanna help. I can shoot a gun.
Please.

567
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,690
Just take me with you.

568
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,842
You listen to what your mama says.

569
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,971
I will take care of this man,
I promise you.

570
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,851
- I swear on my life.
- How long you been after him?

571
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,765
Why didn't you catch him
before this?

572
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,763
Answer me, marshal!

573
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,801
You don't know
all that he's done here.

574
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,321
Mr. Earp, you get him.
You get that man.

575
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,807
What that man did was barbaric.

576
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,484
You okay, Mr. Taylor?

577
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,649
I'll be fine.

578
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,564
You wanna go on?

579
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,722
- Yes.
- You a married man, Mr. Taylor?

580
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,286
No.

581
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,204
Brothers? Sisters?

582
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,926
Only child.

583
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,849
Man needs family. Folks?

584
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,609
My mother passed last year.
My father when I was young.

585
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,648
- This might be too much for you.
- No. No.

586
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,525
Please continue.

587
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,082
Leaving that man's body was
just the beginning of the bloodshed.

588
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,529
Spike had no sorrow,
no guilt about what he did.

589
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,527
With the boys split up, they'd wanna
meet up with the gang before long.

590
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,201
We'd have a force on our hands.

591
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,328
On the house, boys.

592
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,291
It's to you, Bass.

593
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,363
I saw the front cover of the Times.

594
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,007
I just don't think
you got that gold hidden.

595
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,731
You read too many
of them dime novels.

596
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,211
That leaves you, Jose.

597
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,442
You know why they call me
Chavez y Chavez?

598
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,050
Because I'm double.
Not one but two.

599
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,405
Well, read them and weep, boys.

600
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,209
Wait, wait. You lying sons of bitches.

601
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,811
Why don't you stand up
and turn around real slow like?

602
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,729
Certainly.

603
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,684
- Marshal Wyatt Earp.
- Sam Kenedy, you're under arrest.

604
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,611
For what? I didn't do nothing.

605
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,728
We'll let the judge decide that.

606
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,486
- Where's your brother at?
- Marshal...

607
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,041
...you can't arrest me
without a badge.

608
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,807
Besides, you're just a town marshal.

609
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,681
It seems to me
that you're in the wrong town.

610
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,803
Did you get fired?
Did you all get fired?

611
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,610
Let's get him out of here, boys.

612
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,610
Oh, howdy, sheriff.

613
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,128
What's going on here?
People are telling me you're scar...

614
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,044
Charlie? Is that you?

615
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,601
Wyatt?

616
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,328
- Bat?
- Sure enough, sheriff.

617
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,886
This man is wanted in Dodge City
for murder along with his brother.

618
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,761
We're gonna bring them in for some
justice, likely from the end of a rope.

619
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,285
Got a warrant?

620
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,570
No warrant, no prisoner.

621
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,121
That's unconstitutional.
You know that, Charlie.

622
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,851
I told you.

623
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,690
Sheriff, this here's the brother
of James "Spike" Kenedy.

624
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,681
You've seen all the
wanted posters around.

625
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,047
We know who Spike Kenedy is.

626
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,170
We also know who his daddy is too.
Now, Mifflin...

627
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,402
...he and the mayor here are friends.

628
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,924
Sorry, boys.

629
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,570
I can't let you take him.

630
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,088
I don't think you understand.
We're in a bit of a time crunch here.

631
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,650
Don't make me insist.

632
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,002
We're the ones gonna have to insist.

633
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,006
Is that a fact?

634
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,925
You boys running around
without your badges.

635
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,087
That's a pretty bold move,
going after the Kenedy brothers.

636
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,927
Them renegades hear about it,
they're gonna come for you.

637
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,005
Spike.

638
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,210
- What's this about?
- Matter of a posse to take care of.

639
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,169
- What kind of a posse?
- Wyatt Earp.

640
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,481
Son of a bitch chased us down
from Dodge City.

641
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,604
- Hey, where's my brother?
- Ask Sanchez.

642
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,046
He was at the Old House.

643
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,207
- All right, let's move out.
- Come on.

644
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,641
Townspeople of Dodge just might
throw you and Spike a parade.

645
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,809
What are you smiling at?

646
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,646
Don't you worry now. Your brother
will be in your presence once again.

647
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:16,283
Never catch him.
Well across county line.

648
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,529
Way to Mexico.

649
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,001
Yeah? We'll just see
if you keep on laughing...

650
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,687
...while you're swinging
from them Dodge City gallows.

651
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,369
<i>He planned a break
from your capture?</i>

652
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,524
One man cannot believe
he could escape such a large force.

653
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:34,002
Sam was not my concern
at the moment.

654
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,164
I knew Spike
would be looking to reclaim him.

655
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,767
Once he found he was in our custody,
there would be trouble.

656
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,891
There would be some blood spilled.

657
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,762
Sam Kenedy. Where is he?

658
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,963
Hey.

659
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,884
Sanchez.

660
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,962
- You said he was here.
- They're gone, boss.

661
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,404
Where the hell is he?

662
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,611
Spike.

663
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,323
Where's my brother, Lloyd?

664
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,405
Afraid he's got company.

665
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,080
Wyatt Earp, no less.

666
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,610
He's gonna get a new necktie.

667
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,970
Now, boys...

668
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,444
...I don't want any trouble.

669
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,849
So just hand over your guns.

670
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,964
All of you.

671
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,647
Do what he says.

672
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,561
My father's gonna hear
about this, Lloyd.

673
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,480
That'll be the day.

674
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,366
Wyatt Earp is dead. You hear me?

675
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,522
They're all dead!

676
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,729
You became the prey.

677
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,487
You could say that, I suppose.

678
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,527
Or you could say that Sam
became the bait.

679
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,559
All depends on how you look at it.

680
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,808
We could be going
the wrong way completely.

681
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,087
I believe our friend here
may have some answers for us.

682
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,608
Tell us where your brother is,
the judge may go easy on you.

683
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,046
Yeah.

684
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,283
Any fighting breaks out,
I swear I'll kill you myself.

685
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,044
Hoist them.

686
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,008
- Belts on the ground.
- We are lawmen.

687
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,322
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I ain't playing.

688
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,889
I ain't gonna ask you again.
Now! Bill.

689
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,647
Nice and easy.

690
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,650
I can see the headlines now:

691
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,407
"Wyatt Earp and his posse
caught with their pants down."

692
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,042
It's gonna be tequila
and senoritas for me. Come on.

693
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,242
I wouldn't if I were you.

694
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,284
You couldn't have just grazed him?

695
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,805
- How is he?
- He needs a doctor.

696
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,883
Finding a doctor's gonna take time.

697
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,169
- That's time we don't have, Wyatt.
- Bill? Do we have a trail?

698
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,606
- We ought to talk about heading back.
- Giving up?

699
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,206
Look, we gotta start
thinking about ourselves.

700
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,929
I see. Bat?

701
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,481
Denton isn't far.
They'll have a doctor there.

702
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,641
Denton it is.

703
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,366
Come on.

704
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,682
<i>He wasn't about to get away from me.</i>

705
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,811
I never lost a man in custody.
I wasn't about to start now.

706
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,203
Dead or alive,
he'd still be a lure to Spike.

707
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,359
Luckily, there was a town nearby.

708
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,921
You're purring like a kitten, Pete.

709
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,481
Purring like a kitten.

710
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,686
Hey.

711
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,446
I'm gonna try something else now,
Pete.

712
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,928
How you feeling, boy?

713
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,125
Let's have another go.

714
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,041
All right, Pete.

715
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,446
Giggling like a schoolgirl there,
Pete.

716
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,602
Giggling like a schoolgirl.

717
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,401
- Looks like we found us the one.
- I do believe so.

718
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,481
Mercy.

719
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,609
- Come on, Pete. We can get this.
- Good luck. Come on.

720
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,604
Doesn't but tickle a bit,
does it, Pete?

721
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,683
Just like...

722
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,286
...being in the schoolyard, isn't it?

723
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,363
Yes, sir, it's almost there.

724
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,410
I can feel it trembling at the root.

725
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,682
- You a doctor?
- Lord have mercy, Pete.

726
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,571
- You're doing great.
- Excuse me, sir.

727
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,644
- Are you a doctor?
- Some call it that, yes.

728
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,091
Though I'm rather busy
at the moment, if you'll excuse me.

729
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,200
Did I stutter?

730
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,521
I don't think you realise
this here's a matter of life and death...

731
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,170
...and we're willing to pay.

732
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,130
In advance.

733
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,570
Thank you for your time, Pete.

734
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,921
Gentlemen.

735
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,726
Boys.

736
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,161
I don't think you understand.
I only do extractions.

737
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,210
Believe me,
it's gonna be an extraction.

738
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,207
Well...

739
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,324
...I am an oral surgeon,
but I suppose we can...

740
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,082
...make room for the table.

741
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,526
Set him down.

742
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,004
Seems your friend
has succumbed to gunplay.

743
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,323
Might I enquire as to
the events that led to this?

744
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,891
You may not.

745
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,602
Fair enough.
Gentlemen, hold him down, please.

746
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,641
Giddyap.

747
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,124
- No!
- My. Boy, that is deep.

748
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,409
I believe I'll have to try
another procedure.

749
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,410
Thank God, doc. Give me a little.

750
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,846
Much better.

751
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,766
Wait, wait.

752
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,491
Please. No. No, no.

753
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,849
Doctor.

754
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,371
Why don't you tell us
where your brother is...

755
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,888
...or it might take a long time
to dig out this here bullet.

756
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,326
Sir, I must protest.

757
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,450
My name is Marshal Wyatt Earp.

758
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,602
That there
is Marshal Charlie Bassett.

759
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,603
That's Bill Tilghman.

760
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,603
This here is Sheriff Bat Masterson.

761
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,683
This is the brother of Spike Kenedy.

762
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,810
We're after these boys
for the murder of an innocent woman.

763
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,281
I didn't kill that girl!

764
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,044
Shut up.

765
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,451
- Little boy's daddy too.
- Now, we need your help.

766
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,489
Wyatt Earp?

767
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,244
Bat Masterson?

768
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,368
Well, go on, boy.

769
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,922
Tell the gentlemen
what they wanna know.

770
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,048
Where's your brother?

771
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,327
I ain't telling you nothing, law dog.

772
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,723
Well, I wonder
where this bullet could be.

773
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,961
No.

774
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,524
No, okay. Okay. Okay, marshal.

775
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,887
Okay, okay. Doc.

776
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,283
Just a... Just a little bit of whisky?

777
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,126
Yeah.

778
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,601
That's good. Thanks, doc.

779
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,606
Now, the question
I'd be asking myself, marshal...

780
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,287
...is what was Miss Dora
doing in a married man's bed?

781
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,567
Maybe that's how
Mayor Kelly got the name "Dog."

782
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,008
Seems to me my brother Spike
did Dodge City a favour.

783
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,044
And you and your men
are willing to risk your lives...

784
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,851
...for a whore actress
and a corrupt politician.

785
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,607
Now, what Mayor Kelly does
in his private time is his business.

786
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,921
But bringing you and your brother
in to justice, that's mine.

787
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,206
It looks like you just showed
your hand, marshal.

788
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,643
Seems to me somebody's
out to get a little more than justice.

789
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,290
- Let him die.
- No.

790
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,283
No. No! Wait, okay. Okay!

791
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,001
No! The ranch. The ranch. My...

792
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,322
My... My daddy's ranch
in Santa Teresa.

793
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,251
- He riding alone?
- No.

794
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,201
Probably 901..

795
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,364
Probably got Sanchez with him
by now and Confederate Jones.

796
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,488
Spike had me round them up
at Oak Hill.

797
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,681
That's all I know, I swear.

798
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,889
Killer shooters, Wyatt.
Not likely to take captives.

799
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,690
That's all I know. Okay?

800
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,604
But you should know...

801
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,690
...my daddy...

802
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,481
...is a very powerful man.

803
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,005
Y'all don't stand a chance.

804
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,849
I think that bullet's
ready to come out there, doctor.

805
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,003
We're indebted to you, doc.

806
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,766
No need to thank me. I'm your daisy.

807
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,050
I never knew law and order
could be so much fun.

808
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,245
If you're ever in Dodge City,
be sure to look us up.

809
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,482
I may just do that, Mr. Earp.

810
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,291
Never caught your name.

811
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,683
Holliday. Dr. John Henry Holliday.

812
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,410
At your service.

813
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,125
- Boys.
- Let's go, friend.

814
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,250
That's how you met Doc Holliday?

815
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,961
He'd come and go several times
during our friendship.

816
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,011
Doc was always free.

817
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,411
We were to head for their
father's ranch to intercept Spike.

818
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,361
He could not be permitted
to reach it at any cost.

819
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,000
He'd be home free
if we were unsuccessful.

820
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,845
<i>But by then, he knew we had Sam...</i>

821
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,889
<i>...so it was just a matter of time...</i>

822
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,486
<i>...before Spike
would come looking for us.</i>

823
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,405
What is it, Bill?

824
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:16,769
He's covering his tracks.
This has all been wiped clean.

825
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,606
And it's fresh. Very fresh.

826
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,082
- How far is it to that ranch?
- About 20 miles.

827
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,084
Be the west side of Clark County,
I suppose.

828
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,926
Mifflin Kenedy, he's a war hero.
He's not gonna hand over his son...

829
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,368
...knowing he's gonna
be swinging from the gallows.

830
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,045
"Surrender Sam or die."

831
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,847
He's dead.

832
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,362
I warned you, Earp.

833
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,171
Spike, he got a mind all of his own.

834
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,961
Spike ain't like you and me.

835
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,330
He ain't gonna quit
till he gets what he wants.

836
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,244
This is just the beginning.

837
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,248
You best figure out another plan.

838
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,091
You really are some
stupid sons of bitches.

839
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,726
Spike! Go give them hell, now.

840
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,771
Wyatt.

841
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,644
I'm okay!

842
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,771
Spike. Spike, where are you?

843
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,445
Hold your fire.

844
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,805
Now, you wanna get down.

845
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,248
Wyatt! Hand over Sam
or you all die.

846
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,041
Come on.

847
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,201
Damn it, watch out for Sam!
I'll kill you myself!

848
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,761
You better stay with me
if you wanna stay alive.

849
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,201
Drop it!

850
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,365
Wyatt Earp.

851
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,451
I'm gonna shoot him, Spike.
Sanchez, out of the way!

852
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,761
Shut up, he's mine!

853
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,681
Damn it.

854
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,686
I ain't going to the gallows!

855
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,879
Spike! Spike?

856
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,802
Spike! Spike?

857
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,841
Spike eluded your capture?
I don't understand.

858
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,527
You were a hero. You had him in
your grasp and you let him get away?

859
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,207
Let me ask you something.
What have you ever done?

860
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,649
You sit behind a desk
and you write stories.

861
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,963
Not living your own life,
living somebody else's.

862
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,969
You, sir, are no man.

863
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,961
No idea what it means to be a man.
What's wrong with your generation?

864
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,761
Sit around and talk about what's right,
talk about the law.

865
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,248
Taking law for granted.

866
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,528
The law is an action.

867
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,041
You never had to face death.

868
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,607
Never had to face the idea
of killing a man for what is right...

869
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,125
...because it's right.

870
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,123
Not as of yet, Mr. Earp.

871
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,611
Not as of yet.

872
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,964
Call myself a goddamn hero.

873
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,609
Only children and fiction writers
throw those kind of words around.

874
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,761
Which are you?

875
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,922
Shall I continue, Mr. Taylor?

876
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,570
Please go on.

877
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,409
Well, poor Charlie, as it turned out,
was hurt pretty bad.

878
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,610
- I'm fine. Help me up.
- We need to get Charlie to a doctor.

879
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,001
Best doctors outside of Wichita
are in Dodge.

880
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,241
We can't give up now.

881
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,165
We're back to square one.
We didn't get Spike, Sam got away.

882
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,766
If we don't get Charlie a doctor,
he's gonna die.

883
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,365
And with Hinkle after us...

884
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,522
...we might not go back as free men.

885
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,486
We tried, Wyatt.

886
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,883
- We can get Spike another day.
- No.

887
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,850
He'll hold up,
seek sanctuary, pay judges...

888
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,525
...and we'll have no recourse.

889
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,330
He may be free for good.

890
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,927
All this justice and for what?
At what cost? Charlie's life?

891
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,046
Is it worth that?

892
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,529
He won't get away with killing Dora,
Bat. I won't allow that.

893
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,923
What about you, Bill?

894
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,762
Bat may be right.

895
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,371
This might be over for now.

896
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,405
And so what? We all go back
to our nice, warm beds...

897
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,961
...wake up,
and it's all a bad dream? Is that it?

898
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,686
No, you're right, Bat.

899
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,571
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

900
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,883
Charlie needs help. You take him
to Dodge. I'm going in alone.

901
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,361
I never should have brought
you boys into this.

902
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:47,003
You going after Spike's gang alone,
that's not justice or courage.

903
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,366
That's suicide.

904
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,761
You made your decision,
now let me make mine.

905
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,207
You dying won't bring her back,
Wyatt.

906
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,691
Step down, Bat.

907
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,003
If you're determined to ride into
the gates of Hades itself...

908
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,764
...I'm gonna be by your side.

909
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,328
Well, we're getting him some help.

910
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,763
Wyatt, there may be a doctor
in Cedar City.

911
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,491
- It's a ways but...
- It's on the way to the ranch.

912
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,371
Shortcut. Tell me you know one.

913
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,170
All right.

914
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,927
<i>Charlie had lost a lot of blood.</i>

915
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,087
<i>A lot of men wouldn't have had
the fortitude Charlie had.</i>

916
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,926
When we got to Cedar,
a doctor quickly patched him up.

917
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,608
Vitals were missed.
Through the meat, they called it.

918
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,923
Doctor ordered a few days' rest,
but he wouldn't have it.

919
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,764
I persuaded him.

920
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,369
<i>Bat, Bill and myself,
we continued on.</i>

921
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,969
- You let me do the talking.
- What are we gonna tell him?

922
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,246
Don't open your mouth.

923
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,365
What have you done?

924
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,642
What do you mean?
Just happen to be about, that's all.

925
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,931
You only come here
when you're in trouble. What is it?

926
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:21,529
They're here now and they're safe,
and that is all that matters.

927
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,367
Tell me or get off this property.

928
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,443
What happened to you, Sam?

929
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,762
I got shot twice.

930
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,523
And the second one
nearly tore me in half.

931
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,526
Is that all?

932
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,401
- Come on.
- A girl is dead.

933
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,086
- Where?
- Dodge City.

934
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,891
- Shots were meant for Kelly.
- It was an accident.

935
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,560
An accident?

936
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,166
I've put up with your abuse,
your thievery...

937
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,802
...your animal instincts, but this...

938
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,605
...a dead girl.

939
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,890
- Well...
- I don't wanna hear it...

940
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,724
...from either one of you.

941
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:13,049
I'm tired of your excuses
and disappointments.

942
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,443
Mifflin. Mifflin,
they are still your sons.

943
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,769
How many? How many are coming?

944
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,965
Earp.

945
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,328
Wyatt Earp.

946
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,209
He will not be bought.

947
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,930
Bat Masterson.

948
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,361
Charlie Bassett.

949
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,808
And they also have that...
I don't know, that Injun or something.

950
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,849
Billy Tilghman.

951
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,763
My God, what have you
brought upon us?

952
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,168
You are my sons.

953
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:00,444
I will protect you
but I will never forgive you.

954
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,045
We'll be ready when Earp
and his friends get here.

955
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,439
<i>We knew Spike and Sam
were holed up in their father's ranch.</i>

956
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,761
We could have turned back
or we could finish it.

957
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,287
I decided to finish it.

958
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,401
And the closer we got...

959
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,291
...the more I couldn't shake
that feeling in my gut...

960
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,322
...that men were gonna be killed
that day.

961
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,162
Maybe my friends.

962
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,001
It's what we set out for.

963
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,408
There was no turning back.

964
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,325
Anybody see that?

965
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,086
- Where'd that come from?
- In the rocks on the ridge.

966
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,609
- You see anything, Pa?
- Not yet.

967
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,966
Pa!

968
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,046
Right here.

969
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,645
Anybody see that?

970
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,490
They got us in a crossfire.

971
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,724
Goddamn it, I can't see anything.

972
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,325
You boys get out of here.

973
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,642
I'm gonna take cover
over at that ridge.

974
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,883
I'm gonna go by the barn.
Keep your guns up, watch your back.

975
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,610
All right. See you back home.

976
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,761
Earp?

977
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,049
Boy said it was an accident.

978
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:29,489
Enough blood's been spilled already.
I aim to take your boys in alive.

979
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,971
- Sam, where are you?
- Spike!

980
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,486
Get up, Sam!

981
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,889
Help me, Sam!

982
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,246
Sam!

983
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,170
- Spike, you might...
- Sam.

984
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,851
Sam.

985
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,847
Sam, you're gonna be okay.

986
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,964
Look at me, Sam.
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

987
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,010
Hey, we got them, Sam.
Sam, we got them.

988
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,890
Sam! Sam?

989
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,250
Sam.

990
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,288
You're gonna die!

991
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,567
I need you to pick a number
between one and 10.

992
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,723
Goto hell.

993
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,928
It's a flesh wound. You'll be all right.

994
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,447
Go get the son of a bitch, Wyatt.

995
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,288
You keep running,
you're gonna bleed out.

996
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,281
Spike Kenedy.

997
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,410
Ain't no place you can go
the law can't find you.

998
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,281
I said I was gonna kill you!

999
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,602
That wound is gonna need
some attention.

1000
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,763
Bullet didn't even go in!
You just grazed me!

1001
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,401
I'm coming for you.

1002
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,928
Lose your holster, Wyatt.

1003
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:26,681
Lose it! Now!

1004
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,170
Toss it.

1005
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,401
Toss it over there.

1006
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,890
Sam's dead.

1007
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,764
You know he did no harm!

1008
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,449
You're gonna pay!

1009
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,763
Is that Wyatt?

1010
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:31,005
Boys! Judge!

1011
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,128
They're back!

1012
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,245
You got what you wanted.

1013
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,844
You wanna blame somebody,
blame me.

1014
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,446
Boys ain't guilty of nothing
but being loyal.

1015
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,645
I gave you boys three days.

1016
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,087
You upheld
your end of the bargain.

1017
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,526
I'll uphold mine.

1018
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,881
Welcome back, boys.

1019
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,006
Let's go! Let's get him.

1020
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,767
- Spike!
- Take your hands off of me!

1021
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,929
<i>Three days changed us forever.</i>

1022
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,287
<i>Changed a lot of folks, I expect.</i>

1023
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,762
<i>My father left us when we were
young, but before he did, he said:</i>

1024
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,207
"When you take someone's life...

1025
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,245
...you give up part of yours."

1026
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,086
That is the truth. I found that out
on more than one occasion.

1027
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,130
Can't come back from that kind of thing
much as you try to live a normal life.

1028
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,282
War changed men. Changed us all.

1029
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,649
And Mr. Buntline, why did he have
these guns manufactured?

1030
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,881
As it happened...

1031
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:46,841
...Mr. Buntline had respect
for that actress.

1032
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,929
<i>He'd seen her perform
in New York and London.</i>

1033
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,409
<i>So to show gratitude for the capture
of her killer...</i>

1034
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,087
<i>...he bestowed upon us
these speciality guns.</i>

1035
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,322
Yeah, good, good.

1036
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,286
Fellas, it's so good to see you guys.

1037
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,646
You know who I am...

1038
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,010
...and I've heard about your exploits
clear back in Philadelphia.

1039
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,606
Bringing down that
no-good Sam Kenedy...

1040
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,406
...and throwing his
worthless brother into jail.

1041
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,686
Great work!

1042
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,320
Judge has brought me here
to show my appreciation.

1043
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,686
I had Mr. Sam Colt...

1044
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,525
...make a special gun for you guys.

1045
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,651
This here is the Buntline Special.

1046
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,886
But also...

1047
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,281
...every time you touch this weapon...

1048
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:39,171
...I want you to remember
the lovely Miss Dora.

1049
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,202
I know we're all gonna miss her.

1050
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,567
All right. Now, Wyatt Earp,
that there is for you.

1051
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,371
Mighty glad you got
your badge back there, marshal.

1052
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,241
- Let me guess. Bat Masterson, right?
- Right.

1053
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,209
One for you. I'll trade for that cane.

1054
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,522
- I don't think so, sir.
- How about that hat?

1055
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,411
- The hat stays with me, sir.
- I knew it would.

1056
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,083
Charlie Bracket.

1057
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,446
Bassett.

1058
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,251
I knew that. Look,
I got your name right there on it.

1059
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:14,003
- And that means you must be Eddie...
- Bill.

1060
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,528
Bill Tilghman. I knew that.

1061
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,327
This is for you, young man.

1062
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,245
How about you fellas?
Anybody want a shot of red eye?

1063
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,768
- Yeah!
- Come on down! Let's have some fun.

1064
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,685
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Take it easy, Wyatt.

1065
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,799
Okay, thank you.

1066
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,607
His father bought him
the best medical attention...

1067
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,767
...but still he died of the injuries.

1068
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,440
Get back here. This boy's dying.

1069
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,444
I been shot worse
and patched up by a field surgeon...

1070
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,082
...who was so goddamn drunk
he couldn't say his own name.

1071
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:52,606
Mifflin. Mifflin, do something.

1072
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:58,051
<i>I did not intend to kill Spike that day,
but if anyone had it coming...</i>

1073
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,001
No! No!

1074
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,688
I never wanted to kill a man
out of revenge.

1075
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,931
I don't think I did.

1076
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,367
My plans to live a normal life
were over.

1077
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:28,129
From that moment on,
my destiny was laid out for me.

1078
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,130
I had...

1079
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,444
...no choice.

1080
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,363
I went on to kill folks,
bad folks like Spike.

1081
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,130
Tombstone and other places...

1082
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:42,204
...but I don't ever
wanna kill a man for doubt...

1083
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,206
...or out of revenge.

1084
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,284
My father was not around to guide me,
Mr. Taylor...

1085
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,207
...but perhaps things might have
turned out differently if he had been...

1086
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,768
...but I have to live with that.
Neither was yours.

1087
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,400
For that I am sorry.

1088
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,721
I did the best I could.

1089
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,049
<i>Sorry about your father, Conrad.</i>

1090
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,043
<i>And your mother.</i>

1091
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,288
That is not a myth.

1092
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,124
Mr. Earp,
how long have you known?

1093
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,442
Since the moment I met you.

1094
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,129
Years before.

1095
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:21,124
<i>I've taken an interest
in your well being.</i>

1096
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,921
<i>I've sent assistance in the care
of your mother anonymously...</i>

1097
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,048
<i>...enquired from time to time
about you.</i>

1098
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,091
Yes, sir, <i>I</i> knew who you were...

1099
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,251
...even when I read your recent letter.

1100
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,243
Spike destroyed my life...

1101
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,489
...and I blamed you all these years.

1102
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,286
But now I realise
you did everything you could.

1103
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,887
You were a hero
to so many people, Mr. Earp.

1104
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,360
I just wish you could've been
a hero to us.

1105
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,005
You were just human.

1106
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,404
Just a man.

1107
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,290
I hope you can forgive me.

1108
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,205
Don't let what that man did
change you, Conrad.

1109
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,443
<i>That innocence, that's special.</i>

1110
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,284
<i>You hold on to that.</i>

1111
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,363
<i>I lost mine years ago.</i>

1112
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,881
Guard that always.

1113
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,569
Cherish it.

1114
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,281
Take it.

1115
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,171
You need a new memento.
I want you to have it.

1116
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,322
<i>My dearest Wyatt:</i>

1117
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,528
<i>I shall be returning to Dodge City...</i>

1118
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,530
<i>...for another engagement
at the Comique Theater.</i>

1119
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,603
<i>I've thought about
what we discussed...</i>

1120
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,167
<i>...and I've realised
that I cannot live without you.</i>

1121
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,884
<i>I will be yours now and forever.
Love, Dora.</i>
