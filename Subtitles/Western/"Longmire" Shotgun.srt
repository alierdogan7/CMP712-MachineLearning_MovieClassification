00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:18,025
- Henry?
- [indistinct shouting]

3
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:21,028
- Everybody just calm down!
- [Trot] What the hell was that, gunshot?

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,023
- All right, that's enough.
- [grunts]

5
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,820
[Travis groaning]

6
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,872
Help. Help.

7
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:33,282
[groans]

8
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:38,329
[groans]

9
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:41,875
[Walt] Here.

10
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:45,336
Put your hand on it.

11
00:00:45,887 --> 00:00:48,305
- Yo, where's Tyler?
- Tyler Malone was here?

12
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,182
He went off into the woods with some girl.

13
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,184
Shut up! We don't tell
these assholes anything.

14
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,268
We're on the Res.

15
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,187
In fact, you can't even arrest me.

16
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,023
You ain't getting away with this shit.

17
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,399
No, that's right. They
ain't the law around here.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,151
You ain't keeping me here.

19
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:04,522
- I'm gone.
- Everybody, just stay where you are!

20
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,700
- Hold on.
- [groans]

21
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,069
Okay.

22
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,740
- [grunting]
- Come on.

23
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,117
[breathing heavily]

24
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:19,461
[gasps]

25
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:21,581
There is no time to rest. Run!

26
00:01:22,674 --> 00:01:26,093
I hope you brought backup, 'cause we
ain't going nowhere till you let him go.

27
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:27,761
- [Walt] Vic!
- Eamonn!

28
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,638
- [Walt] Vic, I need your help!
- You got them?

29
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,765
Yeah. Go.

30
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,684
Everyone back up right now. Sit down.

31
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:34,761
[Vic] Walt!

32
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,148
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?

33
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,109
His friends said he came
back here with a girl.

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,944
I don't know. He's bleeding pretty badly.

35
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:46,363
I need you to keep pressure
on the wound while I carry him.

36
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:47,656
Okay.

37
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,700
[Walt] Come on. Let's get you up, Tyler.

38
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:52,862
- [grunts]
- [moaning]

39
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:55,073
Did you find the gun?

40
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:56,957
Yes.

41
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,618
Did anybody see you?

42
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,995
I do not know.

43
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,164
Is he dead?

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,045
[Henry] Get in.

45
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,434
[groaning]

46
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,773
Vic, go get the Bronco.

47
00:02:30,825 --> 00:02:33,702
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, is that Tyler?

48
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:34,954
What'd you do to him?

49
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,039
Trying to save his life.
Get 'em out of here.

50
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,625
Eamonn, take Trot Simic to the station.

51
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,502
- What about the rest of them?
- Just remember their faces.

52
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:45,373
- Now go! Go!
- Come on, come on, come on.

53
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:48,759
[groans]

54
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,004
[siren wailing]

55
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:53,714
[Walt] Tyler, who shot you?

56
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:58,018
Where's the girl you were with? Did
she have anything to do with this?

57
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,222
Walt, he can't answer.

58
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:04,100
I don't think he's gonna make it.

59
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,819
He has to make it.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,855
He has too much to answer for.

61
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:23,911
So, where are you taking me?

62
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:28,833
Henry!

63
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:32,128
- Henry!

65
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,188
What do we have?

66
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,396
Gunshot victim.

67
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,649
Tyler Malone. He's a worker
from the Oden Oil Fields.

68
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,900
He's also a rapist.

69
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:49,862
That's your department. I'll
do my best with the gunshot.

70
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:52,489
Eamonn got Trot Simic back to the station.

71
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,740
Good.

72
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,901
[Vic] Is it?

73
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,369
Because we thought that
Trot killed Will Balint,

74
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,121
but he couldn't have shot Tyler.

75
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,040
Maybe we got the wrong guy in custody.

76
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,368
Or maybe we're dealing
with two different killers.

77
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,080
Henry?

78
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,297
Henry?

79
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,966
Wake up.

80
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,051
Henry!

81
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,587
[breathing heavily]

82
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,432
What happened?

83
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,677
I'm not sure.

84
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,390
I think I passed out.

85
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,726
[Gab] Are you all right?

86
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,398
[grunts]

87
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,609
Oh!

88
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,820
What happened?

89
00:04:40,872 --> 00:04:44,617
I believe I have a
.30-caliber slug in my thigh.

90
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:47,703
We will need to get it out.

91
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,706
How are we supposed to do that?

92
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:57,422
The old-fashioned way.

93
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,967
- [monitors beeping]
- [Weston] Scalpel.

94
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,145
Give me some suction. It's hamburger here.

95
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:06,722
Debakeys.

96
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,017
Oh, Jesus.

97
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,964
You need to go to the hospital.

98
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,626
Every hospital in Wyoming will be
looking for a man with a bullet in him.

99
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:38,629
Gab, you have to do this.

100
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,901
[screams]

101
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:38,314
[monitors beeping]

102
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,859
[Gab] There's too much blood. I can't.

103
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:49,033
Gab... you can.

104
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:59,377
You remember what I used to tell you
to do before shooting free throws...

105
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,548
...to calm you down?

106
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,510
I'm not that girl anymore.

107
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,642
[crying]

108
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:19,813
[grunts]

109
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:29,323
All I need is for you to hold this.

110
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,423
[crying]

111
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,575
[screaming]

112
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,289
- [tearing]
- [crying]

113
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:36,898
Dr. Weston's having a hard
time stabilizing the patient.

114
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,401
He said he'll call you tomorrow
if Mr. Malone pulls through,

115
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,820
but "don't hold your breath."

116
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,481
- [Walt] Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:46,574
[sighs]

118
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,694
[Vic] Walt.

119
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,329
Walker Browning.

120
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,947
That was fast.

121
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,749
[Walker] Where is he?

122
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,543
- Where's Tyler?
- [Walt] Still in surgery.

123
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,504
One of my guys called, said he'd been shot.

124
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,422
- Who the hell did it?
- We're finding that out.

125
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,841
I found him alone in
the woods. No witnesses.

126
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,177
Really? That sounds awful familiar.

127
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,887
Sheriff Longmire with a
man shot, no witnesses.

128
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,473
Hey, back off, asshole.

129
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:10,890
- Vic.
- I just find it disturbing

130
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:13,560
that right after you had to release
my guys for lack of evidence,

131
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,020
they both get hunted down.

132
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,063
I thought Will Balint died
in an oil-rig accident.

133
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:18,857
Well, if you believe that's true, Sheriff,

134
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,769
then why is Trot Simic sitting in
your jail cell charged with murder?

135
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:25,356
Seems you always find a way to get your
facts to line up with your theories.

136
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,942
Now, excuse me. I got
another mother to call.

137
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:55,261
[groans]

138
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,319
[Gab] I did the best I could.

139
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:19,084
Why are you still here?

140
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,953
You should have taken off.

141
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:24,791
I thought about it.

142
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,084
But...

143
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:31,464
I couldn't leave Hector here to die.

144
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,218
I am not Hector.

145
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:44,943
What you said when you
were beating that scumbag,

146
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,230
I wrote that in my note, word for word.

147
00:10:49,073 --> 00:10:51,859
If you're not Hector, you
should stop reading his mail.

148
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,867
Well, I guess now we both have
secrets we need to keep for each other.

149
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:09,585
How did you know what kind
of bullet you were shot with?

150
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,763
The man who shot me is my best friend.

151
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:15,048
The sheriff?

152
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,519
Yes, which is why we
need to leave immediately.

153
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,054
Get in the truck.

154
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:23,766
What's the point?

155
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:32,324
The point is that you shot a man,

156
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:36,612
and I could not tell
whether he was alive or dead.

157
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,665
I don't care.

158
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,668
Gab, if he is alive, he can identify you.

159
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,545
If he is dead, they will
come after you for murder.

160
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:49,667
I do not think, given what you have
been through, that that is fair.

161
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:53,178
I have been in prison.

162
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,422
You do not want to go there.

163
00:11:58,392 --> 00:11:59,886
[groans]

164
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,515
[truck door closes]

165
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,525
Where are we going?

166
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,352
I have no idea.

167
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,188
[engine sputtering]

168
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,159
But wherever it is, we are
going to need a functioning car.

169
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:27,830
[door closes]

170
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,509
[Walt] First Will Balint, now Tyler Malone.

171
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,721
I don't think there's much doubt
that this is about Gab's rape.

172
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,641
Question is, is it someone from the
oil company trying to shut them up

173
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:43,186
or somebody from the
outside avenging her rape?

174
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:47,440
Well, there'd have to be an incentive for
the oil company to murder their own guys.

175
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,192
Corporate liability?

176
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:51,361
But nobody even brought charges.

177
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:55,323
According to Archer Loftus,
Walker Browning runs a tight ship.

178
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,784
This could be about somebody
stepping out of line.

179
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:01,572
Maybe Walker had somebody else
do it for him, like last time.

180
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:07,119
Eamonn, how many roughnecks were
out at that bonfire last night?

181
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:11,047
Uh, Trot, Tyler, five others.

182
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:14,842
Ferg, why don't you see if that
squares with Trot Simic's recollection?

183
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:16,587
Yep.

184
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,889
So, if this shooting
isn't about Walker Browning

185
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,726
trying to punish or silence his own men,

186
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,437
it must be about someone
close to Gab avenging her rape.

187
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,105
You know, when we spoke to Sam Poteet,

188
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,233
he said that no one would be able to
protect Tyler once the army mobilized.

189
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,902
Maybe we're back to
your "new Hector" theory.

190
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:36,072
Maybe. But the time for subtlety is over.

191
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:38,150
Why don't you go arrest Sam Poteet?

192
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,705
[door opens, closes]

193
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:45,957
I'm sorry, uh, "new Hector"?

194
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,125
Am I missing something?

195
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:51,921
A copycat vigilante seems to
have started working on the Res.

196
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,206
Hm.

197
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,259
About the Res...

198
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,177
Yep. Mathias.

199
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,339
We got to call him, smooth things over.

200
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,144
Well, Mr. Simic didn't want to talk to me,

201
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:09,056
but apparently he had quite
a bit to say to Archer here.

202
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:27,867
I know where to get another car.

203
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,536
Where?

204
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,455
[Gab] Follow me.

205
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,334
I thought we had a deal, me and you.

206
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,346
That was like the opposite of protection.

207
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,890
You threw one of the very fellas
I'm trying to steer clear of

208
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,725
into a jail cell with me.

209
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,477
And we're sorry about that, Mr. Loftus.

210
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:49,187
You ain't sorry.

211
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,691
You're in the pocket of the oil
company, you and that boss of yours.

212
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,109
Nobody here is in the
pocket of the oil company.

213
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,529
What did Trot say to you just now?

214
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,698
[Archer] He called me a rat.

215
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,826
Said I turned him in. But I
didn't say boo to you about him.

216
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:04,536
That's true.

217
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,781
Did he admit that he was
involved in Will's death?

218
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,450
What'd he say, exactly?

219
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:13,537
He punched me, exactly.

220
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,664
All right.

221
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,676
We're trying to narrow down
who was with Trot last night.

222
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,795
Can you tell us who his friends are?

223
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,430
What do I get in return?

224
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:27,266
Tar and feathered and locked
in a room with Walker Browning?

225
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,896
We're all sorry about the
misunderstanding with Trot Simic.

226
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,891
- Now, it's been a long night...
- Stop right there, Sheriff.

227
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,943
My helping-you days are behind me.

228
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:39,946
Clearly, you busted someone else
for the murder of Will Balint.

229
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:43,533
So if I'm not under
arrest, I'm out of here.

230
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:44,818
Adiós.

231
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:51,241
Miss Victoria, guess
this just wasn't our time.

232
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,456
[door opens]

233
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:03,219
[Eamonn] Sheriff, you told me to remember
the faces of the other men at the bonfire.

234
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,222
Before I forget them, why don't
I head back over to Newett Energy,

235
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:08,099
see if I can put some names to those faces?

236
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,267
- Thanks, Eamonn.
- Yeah.

237
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,060
If you need anything else, call my cell.

238
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:14,230
Oh, and if, uh, you can't
get through, try again.

239
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:17,943
Ferg, call Mathias, let
him know what happened.

240
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:21,362
Meantime, Vic and I will
head to the hospital.

241
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,107
Hope that Tyler's awake.

242
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,324
And after Mathias is done complaining,

243
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:28,160
maybe he can help me I.D. the
Cheyenne girls from the bonfire.

244
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,781
I know what they look like. I
don't know where to find them.

245
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,088
Keep your head down. She did not see us.

246
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,133
Or perhaps she did.

247
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,563
[Cady] Henry.

248
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:58,775
Thank God. I have been looking
for Bowstring Road everywhere.

249
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,151
And it's not on my map.

250
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,313
And I... I'm late for a
meeting with a new client.

251
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:05,440
Is that Gab Langton?

252
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:08,117
We were taking a walk.

253
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,528
How is she?

254
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:12,038
- Better.
- [Cady] Good.

255
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,042
Look, I... I know she
doesn't want to press charges,

256
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:19,295
but if you could just tell her that
I'm starting my own pro Bono practice,

257
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:20,546
in case she changes her mind.

258
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:23,633
Bowstring Road is not on your
map because it is not paved.

259
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,092
Keep going the way you were going.

260
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:28,797
Take your first left
after the power lines stop.

261
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,427
Thanks.

262
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,805
[gearshift clicks]

263
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,980
[groaning]

264
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,456
[Weston] Stomach, spleen, small intestines.

265
00:17:55,457 --> 00:17:58,250
I took ten copper pellets
and three slugs out of him.

266
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,169
Multiple shots?

267
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,957
Or a personal-defense round...
slugs and shot in one shell.

268
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,584
[Weston] Nasty stuff.

269
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:08,887
[Vic] So, you think he's gonna
regain consciousness today?

270
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,429
- W...
- Doctor.

271
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,467
There's, uh, always a chance, but in
this case, I'd, uh, classify it as "slim."

272
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:20,065
I didn't notice the bruising
on his face in the dark.

273
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,358
Looks like he took some
punches before he got shot.

274
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,643
[Walt] Yeah.

275
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,689
Will Balint was made to
look like an accident.

276
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:30,366
A beating, a shotgun blast.

277
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,618
Sure seems more personal to me.

278
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:35,663
So it's like you thought...
two different assailants.

279
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,583
Well, it's hard to tell until we get
to take a look at that crime scene

280
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,792
in the light of day.

281
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:44,290
Hopefully, Mathias isn't too
mad, he'll let us take a look.

282
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,176
You think Tyler here will
mind if I use his bathroom?

283
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:50,712
I'll see you at the elevator.

284
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:21,584
And I want to up the dose of Risperdal
from eight to ten milligrams, okay?

285
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:22,668
All right. Great.

286
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,037
[Walt] Donna.

287
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,131
Oh, hey, Walt.

288
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,466
Uh, what are you doing here?

289
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,969
A suspect got shot. He's,
um... He's down the hall.

290
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,679
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

291
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,223
- Well, he's not such a great guy.
- Oh, right, yeah.

292
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:39,811
Um, listen, I was actually
just about to call you

293
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,938
on that cell phone that you don't have.

294
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,607
But I'm not gonna be
able to make it tonight.

295
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:47,443
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, I'm kind of glad.

296
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:52,198
Not that you can't make it, but, well, it
would have been tough for me to make it.

297
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,366
So I'm glad you had to cancel first.

298
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,035
Well, this is not a competition.

299
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:57,620
No, but I think I'm in front.

300
00:19:57,621 --> 00:20:00,081
- [chuckles]
- So, what are you doing here?

301
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,834
I have a patient who
attempted suicide last night,

302
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,669
so I just feel like I need to be here.

303
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,504
- Of course.
- Yeah.

304
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,632
And you? Is your suspect
going to pull through?

305
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,801
[Walt] I don't know.
He was shot in the gut.

306
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:14,137
There's a lot of bleeding.

307
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:16,514
Maybe we should, uh, keep that dinner date.

308
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,684
This would make great dinner
conversation, wouldn't it?

309
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,020
Um, I hope I can get a rain check.

310
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,556
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

311
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,936
[Donna] So, where was I? I think
what we're gonna have to do...

312
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,158
[clears throat]

313
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:38,577
Isn't that the, uh, psychiatrist
who ran the PTSD support group?

314
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:40,322
- [elevator bell dings]
- Yep.

315
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,086
Look who's back from the dead.

316
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,512
- I need to borrow your car.
- Take Linda's.

317
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:58,139
Linda split. I don't know where she is.

318
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,849
She's probably on her knees somewhere.

319
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,433
So, can I have it?

320
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,929
No, sorry. I-I got shit to do.

321
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,181
Dude, we're out of Apple Jacks.

322
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,861
You're still with him
after his friends raped me?

323
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,029
He's not like that.

324
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,531
- They're all like that.
- You know what? Screw you.

325
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:17,150
Go back to zombie land.

326
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:21,405
Give me the keys, or I'll
say there were three of them.

327
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:25,284
He'll end up dead just like the other two.

328
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:27,702
[scoffs]

329
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,955
[sighs]

330
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:33,883
[keys jingle]

331
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:36,503
I need it back before tomorrow night.

332
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:42,259
Bitch.

333
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,558
Shotgun.

334
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,203
Mathias.

335
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:13,131
I was just heading upstairs to call you.

336
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,582
A few hours late.

337
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,926
Yep. About that...

338
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:19,304
No, no, I get it. It was dark.

339
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,890
It's hard to see boundary lines
in the middle of the night.

340
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,767
I guess you already heard from Ferg.

341
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,977
[Mathias] Didn't have to.

342
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,770
There was a representative of Newett Energy

343
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:29,981
waiting for me when I
got to work this morning.

344
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,774
Let me guess... Walker Browning?

345
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:33,442
Yeah, that's the guy.

346
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:36,612
Well, his men are the
ones who raped Gab Langton.

347
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:39,782
The one I have upstairs
in my cell is a murderer.

348
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:42,735
I'm sure he is, but you're
gonna have to let him go.

349
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:46,789
You know, you can't compel
me to do that, Mathias.

350
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,540
[Mathias] I'm not trying to compel you.

351
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:52,670
I'm advising you that Walker
Browning knows his way around the law.

352
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,340
He knows exactly what he
can and cannot do on the Res.

353
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:58,384
I promise you, he'll use the
circumstance of that arrest

354
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:00,879
to get whatever case you have thrown out.

355
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:09,054
Ferg.

356
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,438
Yeah?

357
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:13,565
[Walt] Release Trot Simic.

358
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,360
[Ferg] Seriously?

359
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,686
[Walt] Yep.

360
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,572
You know, last night happened pretty fast.

361
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,992
I had a hunch our suspect would
be partying at the bonfire.

362
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:24,118
I didn't want to lose him.

363
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,161
I got a phone.

364
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:28,323
You think I would protect some
white oil worker partying on the Res?

365
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:34,204
See you assholes later.

366
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,248
Hold on, Trot.

367
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,720
You're now in Absaroka
County. That's my county.

368
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:43,846
[handcuffs rattle]

369
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:46,098
You're under arrest.

370
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,474
Take him back upstairs, Ferg.

371
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:48,893
[Trot] What the hell?

372
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,519
You can't do that.

373
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
[handcuffs clicking]

374
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:54,023
You have the right to remain silent.

375
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:57,068
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

376
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,687
How long you think that's gonna hold, hmm?

377
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,814
Long enough.

378
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:05,818
[Henry] We will take a right just up ahead.

379
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:08,113
Where are we going?

380
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,660
Somewhere no one will
think to look for you.

381
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,580
[cell phone ringing]

382
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,186
Hello, Walt.

383
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:37,400
So, Tyler Malone, the other man who
raped Gab, was shot last night on the Res.

384
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:39,651
Near that bonfire.

385
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:40,736
Is he dead?

386
00:24:40,737 --> 00:24:42,021
Not yet.

387
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,984
It's not looking good.

388
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,447
Do you know who did it?

389
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,540
I think a guy from the oil company.

390
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:57,128
Walker Browning had Will
Balint killed to silence him.

391
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,963
It's possible he tried the same with Tyler,

392
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:04,877
but, um, the nature of the
shooting seems more personal.

393
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,589
Which is why I'm calling.

394
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,926
Gab Langton's mother, Linda,
has been missing for a week.

395
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:15,597
Linda hardly seems like a vigilante.

396
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:20,519
What about Gab? Have you seen her
since you and I last spoke to her?

397
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:25,148
When I saw her yesterday,
she seemed beyond caring.

398
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,827
Mathias has agreed to let me
take a look at the crime scene.

399
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,864
Hopefully, something turns
up that makes sense of this.

400
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,501
Keep me posted.

401
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:37,785
Yep.

402
00:25:41,756 --> 00:25:42,965
[tapping]

403
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,376
Stop here.

404
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,476
Drive.

405
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:06,655
[tapping]

406
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:08,066
Faster.

407
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,778
[engine revs]

408
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,869
[Vic] Hey, Walt.

409
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,590
So, Mathias was no help I.D.'ing those
Cheyenne girls from the, uh, bonfire,

410
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:26,884
but I've got some ideas
on how to locate them.

411
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:27,968
Such as?

412
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,304
Well, the easiest would be to get our hands

413
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:32,806
on the security-camera
footage from the casino again.

414
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:34,475
That bridge is pretty well burned.

415
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:37,644
We're gonna need a warrant if we
want to view any more of those tapes.

416
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:39,556
Okay, so let's get a warrant.

417
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,811
Judge already thinks I've
got it in for Nighthorse.

418
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,772
You kind of do.

419
00:26:49,032 --> 00:26:52,743
Mandy Plitt, uh, mentioned that she
and Gab were gonna meet somewhere,

420
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,580
some dive bar off the Res.

421
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,249
Uh, the Blind Tiger.

422
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,834
Maybe some of those other
girls hang out there.

423
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:03,045
Okay. I'll go check it out.

424
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:04,247
Okay.

425
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,627
[telephone ringing]

426
00:27:12,055 --> 00:27:13,431
Sheriff Longmire.

427
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:16,058
[Zachary] It's Zach.
I just left the casino.

428
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,562
Sam Poteet disappeared yesterday,
right after we spoke to him.

429
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:22,565
Right before Tyler was shot.

430
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,442
Any other ideas where I might find him?

431
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:28,320
[sighs] Mathias is gonna
meet us back at the bonfire.

432
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:29,738
Why don't you join us?

433
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:32,900
He may know something about
Sam Poteet that we don't.

434
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:34,902
Yeah.

435
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:02,555
Hey!

436
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,684
You want something from me?! Huh?!

437
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,393
Hey.

438
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:10,856
Got something you want to say to me, huh?

439
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,192
[tires squeal]

440
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:24,744
It's okay.

441
00:28:25,962 --> 00:28:27,955
Not everyone is following you.

442
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,835
Not everyone is following you.

443
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,394
Tyler was shot there.

444
00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:54,232
And I fired from here.

445
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,035
[Mathias] So not only did you
come out here without permission,

446
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,663
but you also discharged your weapon?

447
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:02,281
Just once.

448
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,118
But I didn't hit anybody.

449
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:11,791
Actually, that might not be true.

450
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:19,507
Blood.

451
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:22,176
And over there.

452
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,262
[Mathias] So you hit him.

453
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:28,057
If I'd have hit him
directly, he'd have dropped.

454
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:35,822
Bullet ricocheted off this rock.

455
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:38,192
I'll send this to the lab
and try to get a match.

456
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,987
Start with Sam Poteet.

457
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:43,121
Ferg.

458
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:45,874
That enough of a blood
trail for you to track it?

459
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,043
Oh, I can track from the footprint alone,

460
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:50,003
but the blood will make
it that much easier.

461
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:52,214
Good. Let us know what you find.

462
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:53,249
Yeah.

463
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,544
[Zachary] Sheriff, over here.

464
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:05,344
[Walt] What do you got?

465
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,229
[Zachary] This.

466
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,557
[Walt] That's a .410 shotshell.

467
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:14,111
Probably from a Snake Slayer. It's
a yard gun, small, like a derringer.

468
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,188
Fires these little shotgun shells.

469
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:19,784
You got to eject the shell
manually to reload it,

470
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:23,203
which means the shooter
planned on taking a second shot.

471
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:26,457
So, a shell this size
caused all that damage?

472
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,833
Well, it's a self-defense round.

473
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:30,127
It's got three slugs, a
bunch of pellets in it,

474
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,423
which is consistent with what
Doc Weston found in Tyler.

475
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:36,793
Now at least you know
who you're looking for.

476
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,670
Yep.

477
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:45,134
Someone with a Snake Slayer pistol
and a .30-caliber slug inside them.

478
00:30:57,572 --> 00:31:00,699
[Gab] Wait. We're going
onto the Crow Reservation?

479
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,451
Nobody will think to look for you here.

480
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:05,579
Because Cheyenne aren't
exactly welcome here.

481
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,323
We will be welcome.

482
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:12,377
There is a medicine woman who lives up in
the mountains far away from anybody else.

483
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:13,621
A medicine woman?

484
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,791
You believe in all that old magic stuff?

485
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:23,297
She has a reputation for
making people disappear.

486
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,011
I don't want to disappear.

487
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,181
I just want to go home.

488
00:31:34,108 --> 00:31:35,560
I know, Gab.

489
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:40,899
But even if you did go home, you
would not be able to stay there long.

490
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:44,193
You have to understand that.

491
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,946
You can never go home again.

492
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,123
[groans]

493
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:09,351
We will have to go the
rest of the way on foot.

494
00:32:09,352 --> 00:32:11,387
But you can't do that, Henry.

495
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:14,189
You've been shot.

496
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,683
Yes.

497
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:20,187
But given the location of the wound,
I would rather walk right now than sit.

498
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:42,251
[heavy metal music playing]

499
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:56,348
She's a cop.

500
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,697
How's my favorite witness?

501
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:04,990
[Kiersten chuckles]

502
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:06,658
No, no.

503
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,619
I ain't no witness.

504
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,572
Yeah, we didn't get a
chance to talk last night.

505
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:13,950
Yeah.

506
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:15,918
What do you want?

507
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,963
I want to talk to the girl
that was with Tyler Malone.

508
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:23,375
I don't know any Tyler Malone, so how
am I supposed to know who he was with?

509
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,462
I'm gonna get another beer.

510
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,138
Want one?

511
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,298
Yeah.

512
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:34,512
Tyler Malone is the guy
that was shot last night.

513
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:41,602
Mm, wish I could help you, but
I don't know anything about that.

514
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:45,815
- See, I think that you do.
- Hmm.

515
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,033
Hey!

516
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,401
Laila, run!

517
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,912
Shit.

518
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,288
Laila!

519
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:55,749
God damn. Laila!

520
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,001
Come on.

521
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,577
[engine sputtering]

522
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,084
Why don't we take my truck instead?

523
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:09,680
Found the girl that was in
the woods with Tyler Malone.

524
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,717
Her name is Laila Bixby,
and she's in your office.

525
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:17,270
She's not limping, too, is she?

526
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:18,764
No, why?

527
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:21,525
I was just wondering if
she had a bullet in her.

528
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,443
So, why'd you invite me along, Philly?

529
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:25,570
Because she keeps making
all these weird references,

530
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:27,572
and I figured maybe you could translate.

531
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:30,617
She said she was in the woods with
Tyler. He was forcing himself on her.

532
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:32,243
And a spirit appeared and saved her.

533
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:33,612
- A spirit?
- Yeah.

534
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,075
He didn't have a face.

535
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:41,378
Laila, are you sure
about that? It was dark.

536
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,504
No.

537
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:47,133
He was all black, like part of the night.

538
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:49,845
But with something red
tied around his neck.

539
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:52,764
He was fast and strong.

540
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:55,134
I'm sure he was Tsitsistas.

541
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,648
She's saying the man who
attacked Tyler was Cheyenne.

542
00:35:01,649 --> 00:35:04,435
"Tsitsistas" is our word for ourselves.

543
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:09,531
Do you remember anything else
about the man who attacked Tyler?

544
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:12,777
As soon as Tyler's arm was
off my throat, I just...

545
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:15,871
I just ran.

546
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:17,865
Did you hear a gunshot?

547
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,411
Yeah, about 30 seconds later.

548
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,749
Hey, Philly, why don't you take
Laila and get her something to drink?

549
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:29,300
I don't take orders from you.

550
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:32,880
Vic, that sounds like a good idea.

551
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,676
Come on.

552
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,305
[Walt clears throat]

553
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:52,616
I think I know who she saw.

554
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,027
- It's gonna sound a little crazy...
- [Walt] Hector.

555
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:58,872
I saw the graffiti.

556
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:00,832
[Mathias] Yeah.

557
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:02,417
Well, there's more to it.

558
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:05,712
People have been leaving notes at
Hector's wall, asking for his help.

559
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:08,374
It's how I found out about
those casino muggings.

560
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:17,133
Not long after Gab's rape... I found this.

561
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:28,019
This basically calls for the
execution of the two men who raped Gab.

562
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:31,905
So I guess we need to
find who wrote that note.

563
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,949
And the man they wrote it to.

564
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,068
[Mathias] Let's start
with Gab and her family.

565
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:39,871
- [knocking on door]
- [Mathis] We're coming in!

566
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:41,115
[door opens]

567
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,414
Linda?

568
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,459
[Sam] What are you doing here?

569
00:36:53,552 --> 00:36:57,382
We wanted to talk to Gab, but,
uh, this is a pleasant surprise.

570
00:36:59,266 --> 00:37:00,517
Are you working with him now?

571
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,477
[Walt] We've been looking
for the both of you.

572
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:03,888
Where you been?

573
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:09,234
My sister was in Billings. I
had to pick her up. She was ill.

574
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:11,187
[Vic] Strung out, more like it.

575
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:13,363
Why are you looking for us?

576
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,280
We'll get to that.

577
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:17,159
But for right now, we need
handwriting samples from each of you.

578
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,619
Look at her. She's
incapable of tying her shoe.

579
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,123
Yeah, but you look okay, so why don't
you give us a handwriting sample?

580
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:24,749
No.

581
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,951
Just out of principle.

582
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:30,088
You cannot come in here
and order us around.

583
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,756
Actually, I can.

584
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:32,757
On what grounds?

585
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:36,136
Suspicion of hiring Hector
to kill Gab's rapist.

586
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:40,925
Or being Hector yourself,
like we chatted about earlier.

587
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,728
Get a warrant.

588
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,188
Okay.

589
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:47,848
So, where's Gab?

590
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,353
I don't know. If she's not in front
of the TV, she's probably in her room.

591
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:58,401
What's this in the sink?

592
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:02,495
Laundry. Linda threw up on
the drive back from Billings.

593
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,906
Don't touch that.

594
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,493
Get... a warrant.

595
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,957
Gab's not here.

596
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:18,803
Linda, you ever, uh, have any
problems with mice or rats or snakes?

597
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:21,431
- What?
- Linda, do not answer his questions.

598
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,426
Ugh, shut up, Sam.

599
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:28,939
Linda, do you keep a gun handy
to deal with pests in the yard?

600
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,892
Yeah. It's over the fridge.

601
00:38:50,044 --> 00:38:53,130
.410 shotshells, just
like we found in the woods.

602
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,048
Looks like a handful are missing.

603
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:57,335
[Walt] So's the Snake Slayer.

604
00:38:58,677 --> 00:39:01,380
Sam, take off that shirt.

605
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:05,391
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

606
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:09,305
Sam, just take off the shirt,
then I promise we'll leave.

607
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,265
Fine.

608
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,643
If it'll get you of here.

609
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:22,401
- What happened to your arm?
- None of your business.

610
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,247
One of Gab's rapists was shot last
night with a .410 Snake Slayer.

611
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:28,832
This is not my house.

612
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,708
That is not my gun.

613
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:34,997
The shooter was hit with a ricochet
from my bullet when he was fleeing.

614
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:38,424
Take off that bandage, Sam.

615
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:39,676
No.

616
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,129
You said you would leave if
I took my shirt off. I did.

617
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,556
Now it's time to leave.

618
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:47,676
And we will, but you're leaving with me.

619
00:39:51,772 --> 00:39:57,520
I haven't done anything but drive
to the Super 8 in Billings...

620
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:00,322
and help my sister.

621
00:40:00,323 --> 00:40:02,274
I hope that's true, Sam.

622
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,085
So, I tracked that blood
trail almost a half mile.

623
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:15,586
Then it stopped by a dirt road.

624
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:17,964
So the shooter had a car waiting.

625
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:20,792
[Ferg] Yeah, the blood stopped
right by a set of tire tracks.

626
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:25,638
[Walt] Ferg, check with
the Super 8 in Billings.

627
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:29,226
See if Sam Poteet or Linda
Langton were there last night.

628
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,935
You think one of them did it?

629
00:40:30,936 --> 00:40:36,149
Well, we found matching ammunition at
the house and an empty Snake Slayer case.

630
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,901
I'll call the hotel right now.

631
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,144
Okay.

632
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:44,066
You know you're trying real
hard to avoid the obvious?

633
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,701
Gab is missing. So is the gun.

634
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:50,656
She more than anyone had a motive to shoot
Tyler, and she knew where to find him.

635
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,868
Let's wait to hear back from Ferg.

636
00:40:59,882 --> 00:41:01,584
[Vic] Why are we at the hospital?

637
00:41:02,385 --> 00:41:04,552
[Walt] You need to get
that ankle looked at.

638
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:05,588
[Vic scoffs]

639
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:12,136
Are you wearing a new shirt?

640
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:15,222
I guess I am.

641
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:18,942
Why'd you change in the middle of the day?

642
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,269
Felt like it.

643
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:27,985
Are you seeing someone?

644
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:30,655
What?

645
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:34,032
No.

646
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:37,961
I'll walk you in.

647
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,379
No, that's okay.

648
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,457
I'm fine on my own.

649
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,834
I'll be back in an hour to pick you up.

650
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:57,139
[grunts]

651
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,959
We will have to swim across.

652
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,372
You think Linda ever signed
me up for swimming lessons?

653
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:27,836
Gab, do not give up now.
We have come this far.

654
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,173
Why are you risking all this for me?

655
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,636
It'd be better if I drowned.

656
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,815
A lot of people have let you down, Gab.

657
00:42:40,816 --> 00:42:42,233
I know that.

658
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:44,895
It is about time somebody helped you.

659
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,484
Do you know the story of the Bear Helper?

660
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:54,488
No.

661
00:42:55,956 --> 00:43:01,746
Well, Cliffs Notes version...
I will help you across the river.

662
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:32,359
Now, put your arm around my neck.

663
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:36,447
Okay, not so tight. You will drown us both.

664
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:40,992
Whoo!

665
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:51,677
You're kidding.

666
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:53,798
What kind of teeth?

667
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:58,218
[Trot] When I get out of here,
I'm gonna look up your sister.

668
00:43:59,478 --> 00:44:02,564
'Cause you know I'm getting out of here.

669
00:44:02,565 --> 00:44:05,191
Will Balint's death was
officially declared an accident.

670
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:07,652
How about we officially
declare you a rapist?

671
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:10,029
They don't seem to be
faring too well these days.

672
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,565
[door closes]

673
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,610
You two, my office.

674
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:29,500
So, Mathias finally convinced Sam
Poteet to take off the bandage.

675
00:44:31,427 --> 00:44:33,219
Wasn't a bullet wound.

676
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,720
What was it?

677
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:36,256
Linda bit him.

678
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:41,478
Which syncs up with the report I
got from the Super 8 in Billings.

679
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:47,100
Linda left with a man who claimed to be
her brother, and she did not go quietly.

680
00:44:48,026 --> 00:44:52,939
So, given the missing gun
and the missing person...

681
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:55,776
that leaves Gab.

682
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,496
Except that Laila was sure
that it was a man she saw.

683
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,789
Maybe she made a mistake.

684
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,333
It was dark.

685
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,585
She was probably traumatized.

686
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:09,998
Or maybe she knew it was Gab and she
lied just to throw us off the scent.

687
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:13,168
Both Gab and Laila had
reason to hate Tyler.

688
00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:17,138
You said there was a blood
trail leading to a car.

689
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:18,764
Gab doesn't have a car.

690
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:20,551
Maybe she had help.

691
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:27,933
It's also possible that someone other
than Sam Poteet is the new Hector.

692
00:45:54,926 --> 00:45:56,511
I thought you knew where to go.

693
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:57,713
I do.

694
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:00,674
More or less.

695
00:46:02,685 --> 00:46:04,970
- Are we lost?
- Of course not.

696
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:08,933
But I may not be at my absolute sharpest.

697
00:46:10,192 --> 00:46:12,227
Henry, we should go back.

698
00:46:12,861 --> 00:46:14,730
You need a doctor.

699
00:46:15,614 --> 00:46:17,482
We cannot go back.

700
00:46:19,702 --> 00:46:23,196
The good news is that we are
going to see a medicine woman.

701
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:37,510
Here you go.

702
00:46:37,511 --> 00:46:39,262
Uh, Victoria Moretti?

703
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:43,258
She left about 20 minutes ago. I
think her husband picked her up.

704
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,226
Her husband?

705
00:46:45,227 --> 00:46:46,143
Yeah.

706
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:49,814
Uh, as long as I'm here,
could you page Dr. Weston?

707
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:51,642
- Sure.
- Thank you.

708
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:55,445
[woman] Okay.

709
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,781
- [receiver hangs up]
- The doctor's with a patient.

710
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,657
Would you like to wait?

711
00:46:59,658 --> 00:47:00,866
I'll be right over there.

712
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:02,527
Okay.

713
00:47:11,878 --> 00:47:13,087
Cookies for dinner?

714
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:15,089
Oh. No, dessert.

715
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,133
Dinner was Cheez-Its.

716
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,509
[chuckles]

717
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,344
Coffee or tea?

718
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:21,588
Uh, tea, please.

719
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:24,842
Tea.

720
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:27,518
Thanks.

721
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,647
So, how's your, uh, gunshot victim?

722
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:33,023
Not sure. Still waiting to find out.

723
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:35,686
I could, uh, sure use a few words with him.

724
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:39,447
How's your patient?

725
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:43,868
Uh, good. We, uh... We finally
got to talk about an hour ago.

726
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:47,990
It's just a very complicated situation.

727
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:50,034
How's it complicated?

728
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,752
Well... [clears throat]

729
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:58,542
Well, my patient's suicide,
uh, it was because of me.

730
00:48:07,476 --> 00:48:08,844
So, what happened?

731
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:12,639
Have you ever heard of transference?

732
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:16,560
Is that when your patient
falls in love with you?

733
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,854
More or less, yeah.

734
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:22,573
Occupational hazard, I suppose.

735
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:24,241
I don't know.

736
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:27,077
Any of your suspects ever fall for you?

737
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:28,655
Hope so.

738
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:31,282
[chuckles]

739
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:38,589
Hey, um, I thought I might see you
here, so I brought you something.

740
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,550
John Donne.

741
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,887
I know you're busy, but
you said you enjoyed him.

742
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:48,057
No, I didn't. I-I-I said I
had to read him in college.

743
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,342
Oh.

744
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,970
Give it back.

745
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,016
No, it's mine. You just gave it to me.

746
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,866
You know, you didn't have to pick me up.

747
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:08,285
Oh, no, I was on my way over
already. I, uh, got an update.

748
00:49:08,286 --> 00:49:10,496
All of Walker's crew is accounted for.

749
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:13,123
I either I.D.'d them from the
bonfire or they were on duty,

750
00:49:13,124 --> 00:49:16,126
so no one left to be in the woods.

751
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:17,871
Except, of course, Walker Browning.

752
00:49:19,464 --> 00:49:22,842
You know, it's possible that, um...

753
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:25,302
that Gab was waiting
for Tyler in the woods.

754
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:26,888
Oh, really?

755
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:28,681
You think the rape victim did it?

756
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:30,050
Maybe.

757
00:49:31,685 --> 00:49:33,394
Listen, we can talk about this inside.

758
00:49:33,395 --> 00:49:36,765
You've come all this way, and the least
I can do is make you a home-cooked meal.

759
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,394
Okay.

760
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:46,783
Thank you.

761
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:48,026
Sure.

762
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,954
So, um, I have a confession to make.

763
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:01,171
What's that?

764
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:04,709
Um, there's no food in the house.

765
00:50:05,552 --> 00:50:07,671
And this isn't my house.

766
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:56,936
- [pounding on door]
- Open the goddamn door.

767
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:59,806
I know you've been
following me. Open the door.

768
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,353
Monte?

769
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:25,874
What, is this because Walt
didn't give you the job, huh?

770
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:32,388
- Or you some kind of Lee Harvey Oswald?
- No, I'm not.

771
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:36,475
But I know all about you.
Walt Longmire hired a nut case.

772
00:51:36,476 --> 00:51:38,561
Just one more example of
his questionable judgment.

773
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,680
Hey, you can't touch that!

774
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:48,237
[laughs]

775
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,990
You're going down... you and your boss.

776
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:52,533
You have no idea what's coming!

777
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:54,577
Well, you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

778
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,654
Pack up your shit, Monte, or else.

779
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,542
You heard that, right?
He just threatened me.

780
00:52:01,543 --> 00:52:03,078
You heard that, right?

781
00:52:12,971 --> 00:52:14,380
[camera shutter clicks]

782
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,766
[Donna] You should get a cell phone.

783
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,135
[Walt] Why?

784
00:52:18,977 --> 00:52:22,097
Because they exist and they're convenient.

785
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,649
I like not getting phone calls.

786
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:28,277
[laughs] No kidding.

787
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,488
Do you have any idea how many
messages I've left with Ruby?

788
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:32,406
A couple.

789
00:52:32,407 --> 00:52:35,485
I can see how hard you're
working to find who killed my man.

790
00:52:36,369 --> 00:52:38,079
Shot, you mean.

791
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,573
No, killed. He coded
upstairs ten minutes ago.

792
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:46,420
Was there anybody with you?

793
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:48,589
Any witnesses?

794
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,842
You just wait till you were all
alone so you could finish the job?

795
00:52:51,843 --> 00:52:53,343
[chuckles] You serious?

796
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:56,639
- You own a Snake Slayer pistol?
- Don't make this about me.

797
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,849
You locked up an innocent
man, got another man killed.

798
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,684
You think I'm gonna sit back and do nothing

799
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:02,804
in the face of your recklessness...

800
00:53:03,438 --> 00:53:05,056
you don't know me.

801
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,985
[Donna] He's got some issues.

802
00:53:19,454 --> 00:53:20,655
Yeah.

803
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:23,040
I got to go.

804
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:27,586
Um, there's something I've
been in denial about all day.

805
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:29,005
I got to go deal with it, so...

806
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:30,798
I understand, yeah.

807
00:53:30,799 --> 00:53:32,042
Okay.

808
00:53:36,138 --> 00:53:37,339
[Walt] Hey.

809
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:39,473
[Cady] Hey.

810
00:53:39,474 --> 00:53:40,925
Is Henry around?

811
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:44,687
Uh, no. He has the night off. What's up?

812
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:48,565
I need to talk to Gab Langton. I
was hoping he'd know where she is.

813
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:50,317
I just saw her this morning.

814
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:51,944
You saw her this morning?

815
00:53:51,945 --> 00:53:52,979
Yeah.

816
00:53:54,322 --> 00:53:56,149
Why are you looking for her?

817
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,492
Well, I didn't want to believe it at first,

818
00:53:58,493 --> 00:54:03,407
but, um, she's become one of my primary
suspects in the murder of Tyler Malone.

819
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:06,959
Oh, my God.

820
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,085
He's dead, too?

821
00:54:08,086 --> 00:54:10,713
Yeah. Shot in the woods last night.

822
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,923
Just died at the hospital.

823
00:54:12,924 --> 00:54:14,584
Where'd you see Gab?

824
00:54:16,094 --> 00:54:18,221
Walking on the Res.

825
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,931
- Where was she headed?
- I don't know.

826
00:54:20,932 --> 00:54:22,675
She with anybody?

827
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:25,345
No.

828
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:33,728
- [Walt] Thanks, Pumpkin.
- [knocks on bar]

829
00:54:48,543 --> 00:54:50,412
It's going to get dark soon.

830
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,626
[Henry] I believe we are here.

831
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:02,048
It is a medicine wheel.

832
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:06,761
I know what it is.

833
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:15,353
When I was nine, I went to see one
of these with my mom and my grandma.

834
00:55:17,655 --> 00:55:19,690
They were like you.

835
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,444
They thought it was some big deal.

836
00:55:23,828 --> 00:55:25,947
To me, it was just a bunch of rocks.

837
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,617
So I kicked one of the rocks.

838
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:34,205
Ever since then, nothing
in my life's been good.

839
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,710
Gab, what happened to
you was not your fault.

840
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,631
And medicine wheels do not bring bad luck.

841
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:46,176
- They are places of healing.
- [gunshot]

842
00:55:49,354 --> 00:55:51,306
[shouts] Stop!

843
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,559
I have been shot at enough for one day!

844
00:55:55,526 --> 00:56:00,156
I am Henry Standing Bear,
and this is Gabriella Langton!

845
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:03,943
We know that a powerful Crow
medicine woman guards this place.

846
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,821
And we need her help!

847
00:56:15,713 --> 00:56:22,212
Okay, you got one minute to explain
to me why I shouldn't shoot you.

848
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,511
We've come from the Cheyenne reservation...

849
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:31,762
Your minute's up.
