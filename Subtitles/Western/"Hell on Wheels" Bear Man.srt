00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:02,930
Previously on AMC’s Hell on Wheels…

2
00:00:02,956 --> 00:00:05,375
- Where you from, boy?
- We're with the railroad.

3
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,885
Looking for a guide to take us
through Indian territory.

4
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:10,636
You got you a woman there, sourpuss?

5
00:00:10,662 --> 00:00:13,729
- You say you ain't care about me? 
- I lie to you.

6
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,822
-I want you to be mine.

7
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:20,600
Mr. Bohannon. is gone, 
you need to do something.

8
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:22,363
I'm gonna bust him out.

9
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,005
- Going alone through Indian territory?
- Got to.

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:26,821
Don't go. I got a bad feeling.

11
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,473
Lord.

12
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:05,245
Lord...

13
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:12,359
Don't take me like this.

14
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:15,645
Not like this.

15
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,159
Who are you?

16
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,579
Eva, it's... it's me.

18
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:16,367
Fire!

19
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:19,453
Fire!

20
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,255
My house!

21
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,375
Fire!

22
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,703
Hey.

23
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,256
Mmm, mmm. Mmm.

24
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,676
Mmm.

25
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,769
Give me that meat.

26
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,382
I done my work. Give me my supper.

27
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:17,024
Give me my supper.

28
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:31,372
Give me my supper!

29
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:39,213
Give me my supper!

30
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,360
That's mine.

31
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:42,948
Oh...

32
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,166
Ah...

33
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,620
Aah!

34
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:51,006
Aah!

35
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,967
Did you see her? Did you see her?

36
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:05,687
Why'd she run from me?
Why'd she run from me?

37
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:07,606
She was singing in the field.

38
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,311
Did you see her?

39
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:16,147
She was singing in the field.

40
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,818
She was singing in the field.

41
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:22,487
Why'd she run away from me?

42
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:56,144
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

43
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:58,646
No! No.

44
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,232
Ow... please!

45
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:07,789
Ow.

46
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,078
You ain't her.

47
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:15,963
Who? Please, please.

48
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:17,331
My name is Charlotte Royce!

49
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,309
The savages attacked my husband
and me on a way to Denver.

50
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:22,670
Peter's dead, but his
brother's in Cincinnati.

51
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,839
If you can get word, he'll come find us.

52
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,675
- You ain't her.
- No, no!

53
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,811
- Please! Please!
- You ain't her!

54
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:43,687
Sourpuss?

55
00:27:46,107 --> 00:27:48,609
Well, lookee here.

56
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:50,778
They said they found a bear killer

57
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,996
out on the prairie,

58
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,831
but it looks to me like they got themselves

59
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,784
a railroad man a long way from home.

60
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,669
Who is you?

61
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:01,121
Now, don't tell me you've
forgotten old Jimmy.

62
00:28:01,172 --> 00:28:03,290
I pulled you and that Mississippi boy

63
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,676
out of that tight spot with the Kiowa.

64
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,712
Cullen Bohannon he said his name was.

65
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:14,935
Had himself a sazerac one
time at the St. Charles hotel.

66
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,555
- Bohannon?
- That's right

67
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:22,109
with the Union Pacific Railroad.

68
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,561
I see him covered in flame.

69
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:25,029
Oh, that's right.

70
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:27,982
Now, that was back with the Kiowa.

71
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:33,630
Bohannon say he freed the slaves,
but he ain't free 'em.

72
00:28:33,656 --> 00:28:37,658
Boy, what's infecting you now?

73
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:43,330
I don't know. I don't know.

74
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:45,215
Now, hold on there, sourpuss.

75
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,418
Let's you and me figure this out together.

76
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:55,676
This here's old porcupine.

77
00:28:55,678 --> 00:28:57,728
He's my father-in-law.

78
00:28:57,762 --> 00:29:00,230
I come here to warn him about some bluecoats

79
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:03,984
I come across about half
day's ride South of here.

80
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:07,688
They on the warpath looking
for that white woman.

81
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:09,857
She mine.

82
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,860
No, she ain't yourn...

83
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:15,663
Marked up white woman mine.

84
00:29:15,697 --> 00:29:19,116
Mr. Lincoln may have outlawed
slavery in the South,

85
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,036
but these Comanche ain't
never heard his proclamation.

86
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:24,421
That white woman is white feather's.

87
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:28,509
She worth more than neither of us has on us.

88
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:30,878
She worth three blankets and a horse.

89
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:32,006
That's what she say.

90
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,538
This one? She's worth twice that and a box
of rocks

91
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,943
White father earned her in battle.

92
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:42,773
- He earned her in battle.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:45,442
Do you know what they call you?

94
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:48,228
Pah duh ah wuh toh kweh nuh.

95
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,031
Do you know what that means?

96
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:54,568
"Bear Killer."

97
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:58,238
 Pah duh ah wuh toh kweh nuh.

98
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:01,959
These comanche believe
any man who killed a bear

99
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:04,578
takes up all her power and magic

100
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:07,414
and can't be defeated in battle.

101
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,799
If I know these braves,

102
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,085
they fixing to ride on that cavalry tonight,

103
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:12,419
and they're gonna want bear killer

104
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,588
and all his magic with 'em.

105
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,591
They think you can't be killed,
but I know better.

106
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,560
Fact is, you gonna fill up full of bullets

107
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:21,311
faster than any of 'em on account

108
00:30:21,346 --> 00:30:25,099

109
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:27,935
And that white woman is white feather's.

110
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:32,486
You got a woman and a baby
 girl back in Cheyenne.

111
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:37,995
Her eyes worth a hundred horses.

112
00:30:43,994 --> 00:30:47,738
We got to get you back there
before you lose what's left of you.

113
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:05,355
This is a war ceremony,

114
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,941
and these braves is out for blood.

115
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:11,979
It's best we go before
they realize you gone.

116
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,481
We got to skedaddle, sourpuss.

117
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:18,152
Come on.

118
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:47,064
Look, I-I know you got your

00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,240
Your name is Elam Ferguson.

124
00:31:56,274 --> 00:31:58,859
You a railroad man. You got a family.

125
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:00,027
You don't belong here.

126
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:01,829
I earn my own woman in battle.

127
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:04,031
Son, you go with them braves,
you ain't coming back.

128
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,532
Now, hold on!

129
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:09,837
You ain't in your right mind here...

130
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,741
Savages in the woods!

131
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:36,029
Take cover!

132
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,166
Oh!

133
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:42,035
Go! Go!

134
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:44,087
Up here! Over here!

135
00:34:59,888 --> 00:35:00,887
Fall back.

136
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:03,773
Fall back!

137
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,642
Fall back!

138
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:12,732
Yah!

139
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,367
Aah!

140
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:16,236
Head north!

141
00:35:16,238 --> 00:35:19,155
- Hah! Hah!
- Yah, yah!

142
00:35:42,596 --> 00:35:44,230
You're a railroad man, right?

143
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:45,899
You're not a sage. You're not like them.

144
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:50,487
You should back there
with your wife and baby.

145
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:52,105
You can trade me

146
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:53,657
on the railroad.

147
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:55,659
I'm worth more than three
blankets and a horse,

148
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:58,078
enough to get you to that
marked up white woman.

149
00:35:58,104 --> 00:36:00,853
What's her name? I know you know it.

150
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:05,326
- Eva.
- Yes! Eva!

151
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:07,454
You can sell me and get Eva back.

152
00:36:07,505 --> 00:36:10,804
I am worth something, but only 
if you get me out of here.

153
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,098
Please, please.

154
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,467
Please, you can sell me!

155
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,135
You can sell me and get Eva back.

00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:24,104
Please! Please, you can sell me!

00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:26,106

161
00:36:33,982 --> 00:36:35,281
No!

162
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:38,118
No, no! No!

163
00:36:43,874 --> 00:36:45,676
No! No!

164
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:51,331
No! No!

165
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:19,159
No! No!

166
00:37:53,944 --> 00:37:56,863
Aah! Aah! Aah!

167
00:38:21,222 --> 00:38:24,057
Come on. Come on!

168
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:19,432
- You're mine!
- I'm sorry!

169
00:41:19,483 --> 00:41:20,650
I'm sorry. You...

170
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,518
- I warned you.
- Killed him!

171
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:24,103
You killed the trader.

172
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:25,605
- He was trying to help you...
- Shut up! Shut up!

173
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:27,073
- And you killed him!
- Shut up!

174
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:28,387
You're worse than the comanche.

175
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:29,609
- You're an animal!
- Shut up!

176
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:30,994
Shut up!

177
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:33,057
Shut up!
