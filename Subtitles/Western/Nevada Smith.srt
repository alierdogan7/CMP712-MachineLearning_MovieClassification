1
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,912
Mornin', son.

2
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:27,913
Mornin'.

3
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,209
We're a little off our course.

4
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,308
There's a played-out mine
somewheres around here.

5
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,613
Know of it?

6
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,246
There's a lot of old mines
around here.

7
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,223
This one is bein' worked
by a fellow name of Sand.

8
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,384
Samuel Sand.

9
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,484
He's my father.

10
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,189
You don't say, boy?

11
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,958
Well, son,
your pappy and me,

12
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,125
we hunted buffalo
together in the army.

13
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,260
We thought it only decent
to stop by and say howdy.

14
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,632
About three miles on,
the second canyon,

15
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,003
you pick up the trail
going west.

16
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,472
You'll see the buildings plain.

17
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,339
You have a first name, boy?

18
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,503
Max.

19
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,842
Much obliged, Max.

20
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,528
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

21
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,235
Hyah!

22
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,710
Now you keep out of this, squaw!

23
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,053
Now, where is the gold?!

24
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,079
You tell me,
where is the gold?!

25
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,421
Take it easy, easy.

26
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,221
Come on, Sam.

27
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,786
Sam... it ain't
no use holdin' out.

28
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,354
There ain't no gold, Jesse.

29
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,366
When you gonna get that
in your stupid head?

30
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,560
Now, look!

31
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,159
You're working
a so-called dead mine

32
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,602
but you brought it
back to life.

33
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,832
Now, you found something

34
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,601
you're sittin' on
real cute-like, right?!

35
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,336
Would I be living like this?

36
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,173
You understand, we don't want

37
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,508
all of it, just half.

38
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:40,534
Of nothin'!

39
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,979
Oh, you've been
spreadin' gold dust

40
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,174
around Owl Creek
like snow!

41
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,683
That were a day's
work, that's all.

42
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,345
You paid your store bill
with a solid gold nugget.

43
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,686
I've been working two years...
one nugget, $38.

44
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,714
Wouldn't even pay for
the shovels I wore out.

45
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,989
Look, we didn't ride
all the way out here to argue.

46
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,119
You're going to tell us
where it is, Sam,

47
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,654
or you're going to tell us
with your dyin' breath!

48
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,825
Now, where is it?!

49
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,062
Whoa, boy, easy...

50
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,337
Well, ain't that
right handsome beadwork?

51
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,239
You fashion it yourself, squaw?

52
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,753
Yeah, it's been 15 years

53
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,882
since I skinned
an injun, squaw man!

54
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,915
But I ain't forgot the way.

55
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,324
Please... leave her be.

56
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,957
I tell you,
there ain't any gold.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,934
I swear it, none.

58
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,936
I'm not afraid.

59
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,215
Max...

60
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,807
they're both dead.

61
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,947
No, there's nothing
you can do now.

62
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,352
Max!

63
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,928
Max, stay out of there.

64
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,763
For God's sake, stay out!

65
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,904
Max, come on into town with me.

66
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,015
They don't even look
like people anymore.

67
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,950
Their sufferin's over.

68
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,918
I don't want anybody
to ever see them

69
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,825
lookin' like that... ever.

70
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,294
Go away.

71
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,991
Leave me alone, please.

72
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,586
Gid'up.

73
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,513
My... God!

74
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,388
Max, you poor child.

75
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,859
Now, you come live with us.

76
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,088
Now I mean it.

77
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,391
I can't.

78
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,954
We've got acres of land

79
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,693
and a lifetime of work.

80
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,496
I've got to find
those three men.

81
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,968
And if you do?

82
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,698
Revenge isn't God's way.

83
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,603
Oh, save
your preachin', Ben.

84
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,164
But you're only a boy.

85
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,177
They're hard and vicious men.

86
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,473
Get 'em, Max.

87
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,604
You go get 'em.

88
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,613
Elvira...

89
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,614
Well, why not?

90
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:23,672
If he doesn't, who will?

91
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,683
The law!

92
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,706
The law... what law?

93
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,751
Max...

94
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,188
at least wait a day, rest up.

95
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,283
Maybe I can catch 'em
with that gray horse

96
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,918
before they sell it.

97
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,485
Here... here, Max.

98
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,498
Miss McCandles, I got a rifle,
a horse and eight dollars.

99
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,864
It'll hold.

100
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,302
Well, then, good luck.

101
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,771
Don't forget the way back.

102
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,331
I'll remember you both
for your kindness.

103
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,258
Larry!

104
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,918
Who the hell are you?

105
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,651
My name is Max.

106
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,817
Max Sand.

107
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,883
Just a kid.

108
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,894
Indian.

109
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,952
Half-breed.

110
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,018
You alone?

111
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,828
Spit it out... quick!

112
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,392
I was following three men
who killed my mother and father

113
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,903
and I thought you were the ones.

114
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,236
Are we the ones?

115
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,270
No.

116
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,239
How long have you been tracking
these killers?

117
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,809
Three, four days.

118
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,480
When did you eat last?

119
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,954
Couple of days ago!

120
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,420
Pick up the horses...

121
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,654
and join us.

122
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,936
Hey, kid.

123
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,411
Why don't you go home, huh?

124
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,607
I mean, while you
still have a chance.

125
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,148
Don't have a home.

126
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,853
Hey, how can you guys
be so friendly?

127
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,154
After what I tried to do?

128
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,491
Well, everybody in this world
is foolish in his own way.

129
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,192
Besides,
we were all kids once ourselves.

130
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,359
Weren't we now?

131
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,444
Don't move, mister!

132
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,746
Now turn around...
with your hands up.

133
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,462
Now, all I want
is some food and a horse.

134
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,867
I haven't seen
one of them old guns in years.

135
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,600
Keep away.

136
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,268
It won't work, you know.

137
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,039
I said stay back!

138
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,978
Well, the barrel's all rusted
up, and the hammer's broke.

139
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,847
And besides,
they haven't made ammunition

140
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,580
for one of them
things in ten years.

141
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,590
You want to trade?

142
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,345
I could use something to eat.

143
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,889
You've been through about 25
pounds of food in three days.

144
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,899
You think you're ever
going to get filled up?

145
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:23,859
Oh, I'm sorry.

146
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,096
I didn't think.

147
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,900
I know it's a long ways
to haul food.

148
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,805
Well, finish it up,
if you can.

149
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,140
I can.

150
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,281
I didn't expect you
to be so generous.

151
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,876
Think I was going to throw you
to the coyotes?

152
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,317
You had every right.

153
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,685
I meant to kill you if I had to.

154
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,022
You an old hand at killing?

155
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,656
I killed my share
of deer and... rabbits.

156
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,429
Ever hold a gun on a man?

157
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,991
No.

158
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,163
You're setting out
to kill three of them, huh?

159
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,365
Bang, bang, bang.

160
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,241
You figure
you're going to make it

161
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,709
'cause you got right
on your side?

162
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,870
It helps.

163
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,436
They bury a sheriff

164
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,744
about once a week out here.

165
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,416
Well, I just figure
it's a matter

166
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,080
of me killing them
before they kill me.

167
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,601
Now, you want to show me
some of this fancy gun work?

168
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,785
Turn around and face the sun.

169
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,486
Hit that.

170
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,172
Go on home, boy.

171
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,764
Take the shortcut.

172
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,708
The sun was in my eyes,
and I wasn't expecting it.

173
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,677
You expect a man's going
to hold still for you

174
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,078
with the sun at your back,
then give you a warning

175
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,809
so you can stand there
and shoot at him?

176
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,250
I can hit a rabbit
at 80 yards with a rifle.

177
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,752
A rabbit don't shoot back.

178
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,381
How do you think you're going
to swing a rifle in a barroom?

179
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,981
I never been in a barroom.

180
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,260
Look, just to find them,

181
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,965
you're going to have to comb out
every saloon, gambling hall,

182
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:45,340
hog farm and whorehouse
between here and Mexico.

183
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,504
What do you think you're after,
three preachers?

184
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,377
You going to gun
them down at 80 yards

185
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,507
when they're coming
out of a church social?

186
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,177
You're hunting
three men who steal

187
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,981
because they're
too damn lazy to work

188
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,817
and they kill
because they love to.

189
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,551
Then they hide out
like rats in the garbage.

190
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,888
So if you're going to get them,

191
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,826
you're going to have to eat,
drink and wallow

192
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,192
in that garbage right with them

193
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,663
till you get so you think
like them and smell like them.

194
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,465
I'll do what I have to do.

195
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,934
It ain't that easy, kid.

196
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,029
Finding them is one thing,
killing them is another.

197
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,937
I'll figure out ways.

198
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,442
Ah.

199
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,945
Well, I've been selling guns
and ammunition

200
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,604
to men like that for 15 years

201
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,173
and they got more ways
to cripple and kill a man

202
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,741
than you ever dreamed about.

203
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,379
They'll shoot you in the back,
they'll ambush you...

204
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,946
they'll cut your throat
while you're laying asleep.

205
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,391
All you got going on your side
is some blind Indian revenge.

206
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,690
I'm half-white.

207
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,388
And you're all helpless.

208
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,912
Now, you get so you can do that
with either hand...

209
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,387
and you're half-drunk
or half-awake,

210
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,914
or inside of a dark room

211
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,257
off the back
of a running horse...

212
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,921
you might stand a chance.

213
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,156
A small chance.

214
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,466
Would you teach me?

215
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,942
I sell guns,
I don't teach killing.

216
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,341
Then I'll learn myself.

217
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,274
You won't live that long.

218
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,950
Well, thank you

219
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,544
for the food
and advice, Mr. Cord.

220
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,851
I guess I'll be on my way.

221
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,915
Where to? How? What with?

222
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,722
You know, if I did teach
you something,

223
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,955
that's only half of it.

224
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,723
While you're looking
for them three men

225
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:46,924
you gotta live, don't you?

226
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,057
You gotta eat.

227
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,931
You need clothes, food, horses,

228
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,936
saddles, guns,
ammunition, money.

229
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,631
How are you gonna get that?!

230
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,663
Tracking beaver on Sundays?
I'll tell you how you get it.

231
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,935
You'll wind up stealing
and killing.

232
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,704
You'll turn yourself into
the same kind of animal

233
00:27:58,744 --> 00:27:59,904
you're trying to track down.

234
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,071
Can't you see that?

235
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,104
I don't see nothin'...

236
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,412
except my father laying
on a blood-covered floor

237
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,849
all burnt and cut

238
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,853
with the top of his head
blown to pieces.

239
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,288
And my mother...
split up the middle

240
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:16,693
and every square inch
of her skin ripped off.

241
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:23,892
Well...

242
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,802
God help us.

243
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,721
Pick up that brass.

244
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,024
Them cartridges cost
a cent and a half apiece.

245
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,242
Sit down.

246
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,444
Little poker suit you?

247
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,487
Well, not too much.

248
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,219
You know how
to play cards, don't you?

249
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,692
No.

250
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,957
I guess I can teach you.

251
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,362
Have a drink.

252
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,765
Well, I...

253
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,066
You don't drink either?

254
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,197
No.

255
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,571
Where you're going,

256
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,405
you'd best study up on it.

257
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:13,673
Now, the lowest hand
you can get

258
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,942
is a pair...
that's two of a kind.

259
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:20,941
Then two pair
and three of a kind,

260
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,977
then a straight.

261
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,080
Three of what kind?

262
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,250
Three of anything...

263
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,988
three nines, three tens,
three jacks.

264
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,757
Which ones are the tens?

265
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,896
Don't you know
how to read?

266
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,366
Well, I never went to school.

267
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,993
Know how to write?

268
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,537
Well, if I know how to write,

269
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,697
I'd know how to read.

270
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,005
Anything you can do?

271
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,238
Reach.

272
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,018
That's an awtul waste
of good whiskey.

273
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,384
Where you were goin',
you wouldn't need whiskey.

274
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,755
All right.

275
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,095
A ten has got ten spots on it.

276
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,966
You can count that far
on your toes.

277
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,624
Max...

278
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,684
Listen, you take it
easy around here.

279
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,990
It's just a quiet town.

280
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,190
I know people,
I do business with them.

281
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,995
Well, all right.

282
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,558
But listen, Mr. Cord,
if you happen to see...

283
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,468
Yeah, I know, if I see
anything suspicious

284
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,166
like a horse
with an "SS" brand,

285
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,264
I'll come get you.

286
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,379
Here's a buck...
go buy yourself some candy.

287
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,437
Yes, sir, can I help you today?

288
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,445
Can of peaches.

289
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,311
A big can, please.

290
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,841
Best Eastern peaches
in the West.

291
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,048
Would you open it for me?

292
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,123
No charge.

293
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,751
Hey, you got a book

294
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,887
that teaches you
readin' and writin'?

295
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,128
McGuffey's Primer,
right under the stairs.

296
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,667
Hey, uh...

297
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,009
Of course, you can't pick
one out until you can read,

298
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,447
and you can't read until
you can pick one out, can you?

299
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,642
It's this here one.

300
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,777
Or, as McGuffey would
say, "this one here."

301
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,583
That's 25 cents for the peaches
and ten cents for the book.

302
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,055
Funny, isn't it?

303
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,682
Ideas don't weigh much,
but peaches do

304
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,716
and the freight company
charges by the weight.

305
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,954
You know, six books, it's...

306
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,189
oh, it isn't
very important.

307
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,061
Most people are hungrier
in their stomachs

308
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,656
than they are in
their minds anyway.

309
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,644
Well, there's
your first decision:

310
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,978
Now, that sign on the top
says "Silver City."

311
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,346
That's over in Colorado.

312
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,148
And the second one...
the one over there...

313
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,655
that's "Donner,"California.

314
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:55,284
The one on the bottom, see,
that says "Sonora."

315
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,794
That's down south
in Old Mexico.

316
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:01,390
I-I sure can't tell you
which way to go,

317
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,696
but you want to catch 'em,

318
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:06,397
you best go
where the money is.

319
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,098
If they got it,
they're going to head

320
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,663
for where they can spend it.

321
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,935
If they ain't got it,

322
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,874
they'll go where
they can steal it.

323
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,844
Mr. Cord, I...

324
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,145
I just don't know how
I'm ever going to be able

325
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,582
to pay you back for all this.

326
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,144
No need to.

327
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,554
I tell you what,
you get tired of chasing them,

328
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,957
you look me up,
and we'll talk about it,

329
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:30,517
all right?

330
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,459
Well, no use drawing this out.

331
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,965
Good luck, Max.

332
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,100
Bang, bang.

333
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,765
Yeah...

334
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,404
Very nicely done.

335
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,371
You know, handlin'
one of these things

336
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,812
is only half of it.

337
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,838
The other part's
learning human nature.

338
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,976
That's going to take you
the rest of your life,

339
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,521
so you damn well better not
trust anybody till you do.

340
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,689
Now, you want
to plan your moves,

341
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,754
pick your place to fight,

342
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,528
don't make any threats...

343
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,503
and don't you ever walk
away from one, you hear?

344
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,536
Good-bye, Max.

345
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,240
Bye, Mr. Cord.

346
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,680
Don't even trust a friend.

347
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:05,081
Hyah, hyah.

348
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:08,115
Hyah, hyah.

349
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:12,562
Hyah, hyah, hyah.

350
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,504
Hyah.

351
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,678
Come on, Struther,

352
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,950
you've washed
your little, thin body enough.

353
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,217
Look how white I am.

354
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,690
Struther, please hurry up.

355
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,285
Hey, the dames are comin'! Hey!

356
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,058
Hey, the dames are coming!

357
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,258
Struther,
you'd better hurry up

358
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,527
and get out of there.

359
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:50,795
They're comin' up here.

360
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,462
Hank!

361
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,027
Red!

362
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,067
Cat got your tongue?

363
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,633
Well, come on.

364
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:00,974
- Gee, you're cute.
- Wal-Walter.

365
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,843
- Walter? How are you, Walter?
- Howdy... ma'am.

366
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,904
Hey, look at me!

367
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,744
Want to come downstairs
and have a drink?

368
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,807
- Hey!
- Shut up.

369
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,409
What's the matter with me?

370
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,749
Whoo!

371
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,755
Hey, don't be
backin' off like that.

372
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,189
Hey, hey, one of you...

373
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,250
Well... well...

374
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,388
Hey, I'm in the tub.

375
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,398
Hello, cowboy.

376
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,263
Welcome to town.

377
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,393
Try the next room.

378
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,529
White women more popular.

379
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:31,099
Well, they saved me for you.

380
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:40,840
Navajo?

381
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,944
Kiowa.

382
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,923
I am Kiowa, too.

383
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,891
Well, yes or no?

384
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,758
Five dollars...

385
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,005
...for some questions.

386
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,871
I'm lookin' for three men,
they ride together.

387
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,040
And one of them...
the name is Jesse...

388
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,448
got a scar on his neck,
carries a knife.

389
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,849
May be riding a gray horse.

390
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,683
You ever seen
any people like that?

391
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,484
Lots of men
come through here,

392
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,955
lots of men with scars.

393
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,356
Buy yourself some moccasins.

394
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,829
Why do you ask for them?

395
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,804
They tortured
and killed a woman...

396
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,707
Kiowa, like you.

397
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,639
One man...

398
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:50,118
...has a... scar here.

399
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,390
He works downstairs
dealing cards in the bar.

400
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:59,630
Oh, but he might not be
the same man.

401
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:04,123
Where does he keep his horse?

402
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:07,160
In the stable across the street.

403
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:11,106
But, please,
don't tell anyone I told you.

404
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,575
Hey, mister?

405
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,844
Yeah?

406
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,317
That gray for sale?

407
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,444
I don't think so.

408
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,012
Belongs to Jack Langley
over at the Palace Bar.

409
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,957
I don't think
he'll sell him, though.

410
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,310
I'll open for 20.

411
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,750
I'll have to call you.

412
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,153
I'll call at 20.

413
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,785
Call.

414
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,054
No more bets.

415
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,390
Jesse.

416
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:48,772
Any cards, boys?

417
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,239
You!

418
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,764
Dealin' cards.

419
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,876
Jesse who?

420
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,677
"Jesse Coward."

421
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,775
"Jesse Murderer."

422
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,046
"Woman killer."

423
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,917
Now, wait a minute,
my name is Jack Langley.

424
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,581
When you killed
my mother and father...

425
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,590
it was Jesse.

426
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,852
Look, I'm Jack Langley.

427
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,827
Where did all this killin'
take place, boy?

428
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,123
Hey, Hudson, what's my name?

429
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,322
Jack Langley.

430
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,094
How long I worked here?

431
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,191
Year, year and a half.

432
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,769
Anything else?

433
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,930
Stand up!

434
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,906
Now look, I'm not armed.

435
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,535
My father wasn't armed
when you tied him to a post

436
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,340
and blew the top
of his head off.

437
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,346
Now, kid, settle...

438
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,847
I know what I'm doin'!

439
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,576
He's ridin'
my father's horse.

440
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,174
I'm ridin' my own horse.

441
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,446
With an "SS" brand.

442
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,714
Look, I bought that horse.

443
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,745
I have a bill of sale
for it in my room.

444
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:39,983
Fair enough.

445
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,046
Let's see it.

446
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,960
Now look, son...

447
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,158
if Langley here
did what you said,

448
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,565
I'll sit on him
and let you kill him.

449
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,502
But if he's got
a bill of sale upstairs,

450
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,936
you could have the wrong man.

451
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,030
It's happened before.

452
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,370
Let's look.

453
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,277
Come on, both of you.

454
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,385
You fight like your mother, boy.

455
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,244
Should have taken you
to a sailmaker

456
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,510
to get stitched up.

457
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,984
That McGuffey reader
inside your shirt

458
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,510
kept that knife
away from your stomach.

459
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,922
Kid, the minute you get off
that table, you'll move on.

460
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,289
How can he move on?

461
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,420
How can he ride a horse
with all them stitches in him?

462
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,124
That's up to him.

463
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,598
Kid, you killed a man...

464
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,624
as you tell it,
for good reason.

465
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,261
Now, you did
what you had to,

466
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,771
and that's what I'm doin'.

467
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,638
If we don't drive you out,
there'll be more killin'.

468
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,767
You got any friends?

469
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:28,568
No.

470
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,881
There's an Indian dance hall
girl been askin' about you.

471
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:35,350
Maybe she can help.

472
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:20,927
Where...?

473
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,292
How did you get...?

474
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:26,029
You come back to us
in trouble... and in pain.

475
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,366
You are welcome.

476
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:29,496
How long?

477
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,905
Many days.

478
00:48:31,941 --> 00:48:35,069
You talk in fever
of the death of your father,

479
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:38,672
and Tabinaka,
my brother's daughter.

480
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:42,947
You stay here
with your own people.

481
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:43,951
Neesa...

482
00:48:44,053 --> 00:48:48,183
she became shame of Kiowa.

483
00:48:48,224 --> 00:48:50,385
But she bring you home.

484
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,656
That's good.

485
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:56,495
Maybe both of you
make each other well.

486
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,091
You stay here.

487
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:30,599
Oh, no!

488
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,066
You get right back
in there.

489
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:34,069
It's hot water,
and it's good for you.

490
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,678
"See...

491
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:49,117
"See the frog... on a log.

492
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,279
"Rab sees the frog.

493
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,310
The frog..."

494
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:53,913
Three weeks, you sit here,

495
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:55,948
you never laugh,
you never smile.

496
00:49:56,025 --> 00:50:00,826
"Can the frog see Rab?

497
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:01,956
Rab can't..."

498
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:04,363
You learned to read
not to make you wise,

499
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,334
but to help you
find men to kill.

500
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,969
"The frog can see the dog.

501
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,271
Rab ran at..."

502
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,905
Do you think that I became
a dance hall girl

503
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:19,505
because I was bad?

504
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,484
It was because
I was full of hatred

505
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:23,985
and foolish.

506
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,554
"See the lamp.

507
00:50:25,588 --> 00:50:27,112
It..."

508
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,688
If there was a medicine

509
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:37,564
that would change
the way I was,

510
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,296
I would take it.

511
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:41,667
Do you know of one?

512
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:45,333
Neesa, it ain't got
nothing to do with you.

513
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:50,438
Honestly, nothing.

514
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,146
If I could find a medicine,
I'd take it myself.

515
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:57,277
Really?

516
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,288
For true.

517
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:10,094
See... the... lamp?

518
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,395
lt... is... out.

519
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:23,175
It ain't gonna work, Neesa.

520
00:51:23,212 --> 00:51:24,201
Why?

521
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,410
'Cause I'm gonna
have to go soon.

522
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,714
When?

523
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:32,118
One morning I'll be gone.

524
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:19,090
Make yourself at home.

525
00:53:23,332 --> 00:53:26,768
You... lookin' for anything
in particular?

526
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:30,099
Names, that's all.

527
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:31,128
I'm no thief.

528
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:32,663
Yeah.

529
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:37,437
What kind of names?

530
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,505
Friends of Jesse Coe's.

531
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:43,680
Are you a friend of Jesse Coe's?

532
00:53:47,623 --> 00:53:49,147
I'm the one that killed him.

533
00:53:52,995 --> 00:53:55,828
My name is Angie...

534
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,628
Mrs. Coe.

535
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:03,505
You might call me
"the widow Coe."

536
00:54:05,908 --> 00:54:07,341
I don't know what to say.

537
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,036
I do.

538
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,445
Thank you.

539
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,050
Tell me about the men
he rode with.

540
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:23,650
You know, you look young.

541
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:28,926
But any man that could take
Jesse Coe with a knife

542
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,455
had to be some man.

543
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:32,965
You know where they are.

544
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,502
Do you know their names?

545
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,465
Well, I think...

546
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:44,810
one of 'em's name is... Bowdre...

547
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:47,179
Bill Bowdre.

548
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:50,811
He wanted Jesse to go
on a bank job with him

549
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:53,947
down in Louisiana.

550
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,982
And it's really too bad
he didn't go.

551
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,151
Why?

552
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,061
'Cause they got caught,
put in prison.

553
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:06,360
There was one other one.

554
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:11,606
I don't know his name.

555
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,476
That's all I can tell you.

556
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:43,998
Mm...

557
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:09,489
"Western... gang...

558
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:10,864
robs..."

559
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:15,699
"Bank... of...

560
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,333
New Orleans."

561
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,868
"Two..."

562
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,411
"ap..."

563
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:38,952
Hey, Cap...
what's that word?

564
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,257
The word is "apprehended."

565
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:44,233
Well... what does it mean?

566
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:48,636
Well, it means like caught.

567
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:50,970
Say anything here about
where they were taken?

568
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,909
No.

569
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,379
Fella gets caught
robbing a bank down here,

570
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,315
and they throw him right
into the state prison camp.

571
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,545
Much obliged.

572
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:22,062
Corbin?

573
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:22,833
Yeah.

574
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:23,805
How do you want yours?

575
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,932
Just money.

576
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,384
Sand?

577
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,113
How do you want it?

578
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,247
I want all of it,
in that bag.

579
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,256
Max...

580
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,348
Shut up!

581
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,893
The big money's in the vault.

582
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,091
Get back!

583
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,161
Stay there.

584
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:32,034
There's only one
this time, Warden.

585
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,093
Two years... he robbed a bank.

586
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:45,077
"Two years, hard labor."

587
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:48,642
That's the only kind
we got here.

588
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,913
Startin' with me,

589
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:53,218
everything in this place
is mean and miserable...

590
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,350
the heat, the mosquitoes,
the food, the life.

591
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:59,260
There's nothing to do
all day but work,

592
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,060
and nothing to do
at night but sleep.

593
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,658
We don't have
any walls or fences.

594
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,532
The swamp is our wall...

595
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:11,165
miles and miles of it,
filled with dirty water,

596
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,267
quicksand, moccasins
and malaria.

597
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,805
Any questions?

598
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,747
No.

599
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,045
No, sir.

600
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,878
No, sir.

601
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,288
Just one more thing.

602
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:32,056
Don't ever make me mad.

603
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:58,683
Big Foot?

604
01:00:58,722 --> 01:00:59,950
Yes, sir, Warden?

605
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:00,956
Get him out of here.

606
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,014
Put him in Miller's bunk.

607
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,252
Yes, sir, Warden.

608
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,317
Let's go.

609
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,797
Right over there.

610
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,305
Don't be lookin'
at this gun, boy.

611
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,074
They want you to go for it.

612
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,138
Case you're wonderin',

613
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,648
I'm a prisoner,
just like yourself.

614
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,980
I'm a trustee.

615
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,313
In there.

616
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,622
You don't get
to keep anything, boy.

617
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:41,925
Get a blanket,
your clothes.

618
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,557
You get a bath
and shave once a week.

619
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,897
One razor for
the whole barracks.

620
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:45,901
You take your time.

621
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:46,993
This is your bunk.

622
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,129
Belonged to a fella
named Miller.

623
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,265
He died.

624
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,104
The only way to get
out of here, is it?

625
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,735
Oh, they try it
all the time, boy,

626
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:55,904
through the swamps.

627
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,573
Dogs are out after
two of them right now.

628
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:01,106
They tried to rob
a bank in New Orleans.

629
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,079
Bowdre.

630
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,314
Bowdre and Strayhorn.

631
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,720
They friends of yours?

632
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,384
No... I read
in the paper.

633
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:10,518
Did they make it?

634
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,824
Nobody's made it
since I been here, boy.

635
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,557
Let's get over to
the blacksmith's shop...

636
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:15,996
put these leg irons on you.

637
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:20,600
Something botherin' you, boy?

638
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:26,368
Yeah.

639
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,434
Let's go!

640
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:25,065
Big Foot!

641
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,070
Get 'em all out here
so they can watch this.

642
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:31,765
Let's go.

643
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:00,393
Big Foot!

644
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,386
Now you listen to this:

645
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,418
Strayhorn died in the swamp.

646
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:02,431
Bowdre here is going
to wish he did, too.

647
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,092
When he serves his time,

648
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:07,227
he's going to serve
every day of Strayhorn's.

649
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,398
You think about that... hard.

650
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:32,958
That ain't done here!

651
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:34,588
A man lies where he falls!

652
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:35,928
He'll drown!

653
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,267
The warden's watching you, boy.

654
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,520
Back to the mess hall!

655
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,225
Let's move, let's move!
