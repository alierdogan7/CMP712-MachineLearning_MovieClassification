If he knew anything, he
would have told you by now.

I'm taking you in... on kidnapping charges.

- He was right.
- Who was right? Branch?

Well, you two were pretty close.

19
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,160
I mean, you do kidnap people together.

20
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:56,617

was doing that night

I wasn't gonna leave that
Indian guy alone with Branch.

Look, I-I seriously thought
that Branch was gonna...

25
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,737
look, I told Vic what
happened the very next day.

26
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,837
I'll swear before a judge right now

27
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:15,637
that what I said was true,
but if I do, you two...

28
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:18,079
you need to give me some kind
of protection or something.

29
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:19,577
Are you afraid of Branch?

00:01:22,938 --> 00:01:28,784
You know, he... He came
by a few nights back.

32
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:33,737
He offered me a check for
more money than I've ever seen,

33
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:36,304
and all I had to do was change my story...

34
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,510
tell Vic that what I said about
the kidnapping wasn't true...

35
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,610
but I said no.

36
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:42,576
How did he respond?

37
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:44,677
He said, "you better pray

38
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:48,777
that Vic doesn't tell
anyone for both your sakes'."

39
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:50,410
And after that, he took off.

40

You've been chasing ghosts.

51
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:41,028
The only way you can catch
a ghost is to stop running.

00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:44,496
Stop and look all around you.

you were also involved.

ask, and I do a good job,

me this is everything

against us in the trial.

leave out any information

that can disprove their case.

We need to search through
every page of this,

158
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,408
see if there are any
holes in their argument.

00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:52,107
but, uh... instead,

181
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,306
I gave him just enough
rope to hang himself.

182
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,673
All you did was treat Branch

183
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:59,140
the way you would want to be treated.

184
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:02,573
Problem is, he's not you.

185
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:04,840
What's that?

186
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,575
Well, it's something to
take your mind off Branch.

187
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:10,807
It's from Vic's husband.

188
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:11,807
From Sean?

189
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:15,707
Yep.

190
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,375
[Sighs]

191
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:22,389
Why would he send these to me?

192
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,174
Why do you think? [Chuckles]

193
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:30,296
He wants you to deliver
divorce papers to his wife.

194
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:33,873
Branch: Walt! Walt!

195
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,958
Where's Walt?!

196
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,339
Walt! Walt!

197
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,306
I found Ridges. He's alive.

198
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:41,040
He's alive. He called my phone.

199
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,647
Just... just slow down. Where you been?

200
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:43,907
He... he was on Pike's Bridge.

201
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:46,640
I-I tried to bring him in,
but he jumped in the river.

202
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,273
I followed him on the
road as long as I could,

203
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,707
but then the river, you know,

204
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,815
it turns away from the road into the woods.

205
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:53,875
Walt: Just stop, Branch.

206
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:55,540
Came back here for ammunition and backup.

207
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,494
I figure Ferg and me could lock down...

208
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:59,534
one side of the river bank.

209
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,809
Vic could cover the other.

210
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:05,477
First, we need to talk about
what you did to Sam Poteet.

211
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,567
You just couldn't keep
your mouth shut, could you?

212
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,063
Don't you dare put this on me.

213
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:13,634
I'm not the one who decided
to go bat-shit crazy.

214
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,067
[Shouts]

215
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:18,801
- Hey, get off her!
- Get off her!

216
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:19,901
Get off her!

217
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:23,134
[Both grunting]

218
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,435
Get the key, Ferg!

219
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,768
- Quick!
- [Shouts]

220
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:38,101
What are you doing?

221
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:42,035
Ridges. He's alive.

222
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:56,772
I'm gonna head over to see Nighthorse.

223
00:11:56,773 --> 00:11:59,339
When he hears that, uh,
Ridges has been spotted,

224
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,005
he, uh... he might be ready to talk.

225
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:04,239
You really believe what Branch was saying?

226
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,872
Take a look at him, Walt.
The guy is messed up.

227
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,172
Maybe so.

228
00:12:08,173 --> 00:12:14,272
But just because Branch
isn't right in the head

229
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:17,073
doesn't mean he's not right.

230
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:27,061
- So, what are we supposed to do with him?
- I don't know.

231
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:28,502
Walt just went to go see Nighthorse.

232
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:29,938
You don't have to whisper.

233
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:32,039
Some of us are trying to work.

234
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,786
I understand why you had to tell Walt.

235
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:41,786
I want you to know there
are no hard feelings.

236
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:45,053
[Laughs] Speak for yourself.

237
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,553
Look, Vic, Ridges is still out there.

238
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:55,052
His car's on the bridge.

239
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,706
If you would just go out there, please.

240
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:58,482
Look, I don't know what your deal is,

241
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,966
but I know that I am not driving
all the way out to Pike's Bridge

242
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,727
just to find out that
the car has disappeared

243
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,754
like every other piece
of evidence about Ridges!

244
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,921
[Keys jingling]

245
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,252
The car's still there.

246
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,152
I took his keys out of the ignition.

247
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:23,319
Now, you can stand there
and just say that I'm crazy,

248
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,286
but later, you'll have to explain to Walt

249
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:31,386
how you could have caught
the guy who shot me,

250
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:34,820
but you just... let him go.

251
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:38,386
I can go check it out.

252
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:41,086
No, I'll go.

253
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,320
Anything to get me out of here.

254
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:52,453
Let me out and I'll come with you.

255
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:54,453
We can track him down together.

256
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,554
Not a chance.

257
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,753
[Door slams]

258
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,353
[Indistinct conversations]

259
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:11,653
[Echoing] Nighthorse!

260
00:14:11,654 --> 00:14:13,952
We need to talk.

261
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,320
You'll have to come up here, then.

262
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,686
Nighthorse: Very busy day today.

263
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:23,419
We're about to finish phase
three of our construction.

264
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,186
Walt: I'll make this quick, then.

265
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,753
It's time you admitted you
lied to me about David Ridges.

266
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:30,753
Seriously, again with this?

267
00:14:30,754 --> 00:14:32,619
It's getting boring, Walt.

268
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,885
I got hard evidence that Ridges is alive.

269
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:39,453
One of my deputies saw
him, even talked to him.

270
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,053
Really?

271
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,086
This wouldn't be the same Deputy

272
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:49,720
who recently kidnapped a good Cheyenne man

273
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:52,219
and force-fed him peyote?

274
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,619
Where did you hear that?

275
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,554
Word gets around.

276
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,252
So it looks like

277
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:03,619
all you really have to
prove that David is alive

278
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:09,286
is the word of an obviously
unstable criminal, really.

279
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,386
I wouldn't call that hard evidence, Walt.

280
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,919
Now, this game you're playing
with discrediting Branch...

281
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,653
having him drugged with peyote,

282
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,152
sending Ridges in to mess with his head...

283
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,186
this ain't gonna work much longer.

284
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,519
I know you lied to me about Ridges.

285
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,252
He is alive.

286
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:31,120
And it's only a matter
of time before I prove it.

287
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,686
Barlow: Longmire!

288
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:43,852
[Door opens]

289
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,952
Longmire!

290
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:48,386
Uh, he's not here right now.

291
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:49,753
He'll be back soon.

292
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:51,653
Dad, I thought you were bringing a lawyer.

293
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:52,919
I don't have time to waste.

294
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,453
Open that cell. Release my son.

295
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,453
I can't do that... not
until Walt gives the okay.

296
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:00,954
Ferguson.

297
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:04,586
Does your dad still own
that roofing business?

298
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:08,219
Because I swear to you, if
you don't open that cell,

299
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,653
your father will never get
another construction job

300
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:12,885
in this state again.

301
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:16,520
- You can't do that.
- Try me.

302
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,386
Your honor, the state's request
to advance our trial date

303
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:24,319
is completely out of line. This is nothing

304
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,419
but the Prosecution's
attempt to derail our case.

305
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,852
You don't need to get
emotional, Miss Longmire.

306
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:30,486
The state has a valid reason

307
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,686
for requesting that the date be moved.

308
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,353
- Which is?
- Witness availability.

309
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,952
Our key witness, Detective Fales,

310
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,754
leaves the state in a month's time.

311
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:40,219
We need to hold the trial before
then in order to get his testimony.

312
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,553
Your honor, the D.A.'s office

313
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:43,386
could easily record Fales' testimony.

314
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:44,686
Well, you might find it hard

315
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,553
to cross-examine a video, Counselor.

316
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:51,619
Well, the state's request for
an earlier trial date is granted.

317
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,919
Well, in that case, we'd like to
formally file for a continuance.

318
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,353
There's no reason this case
even needs to go to trial.

319
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,319
We'd be more than happy to make a deal.

320
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,353
Under what terms?

321
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:00,619
Your client pleads guilty,

322
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,353
we take the death penalty off the table.

323
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,252
We can offer a life sentence

324
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:06,619
with a possibility of
parole after 25 years.

325
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,052
[Laughs]

326
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:10,252
Miss Longmire will have
to consult with her client.

327
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,885
There is nothing to discuss.

328
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:14,885
That deal is not an option.

329
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:17,186
It is an option. Your only one, actually.

330
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:19,353
This trial's happening in two weeks.

331
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,334
<i>What, exactly, were you
planning on presenting in court?</i>

332
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,391
What we talked about...

333
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,893
that Malachi hired Darius
Burns to kill Miller Beck.

334
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:25,941
No, you have no proof

335
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:28,026
that Darius even has
a connection with Beck.

336
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:30,527
I hate to say it, Cady,
but you've got nothing.

337
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:33,661
Other than the fact that I am innocent.

338
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:49,062
[Sighs]

339
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:54,828
[Door closes]

340
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:04,893
Where's Branch?

341
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:08,060
I got him a burrito.

342
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:10,161
His dad came and picked him up.

343
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:15,527
How did Barlow even know he was here?

344
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,527
Well, everyone we arrest is
allowed to make a phone call,

345
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:21,060
and technically, we never arrested Branch.

346
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,588
And Vic didn't file a complaint,

347
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:23,893
and you said that Sam Poteet guy

348
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,117
wasn't pressing charges,

349
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:26,627
so we had nothing to hold him on.

350
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:27,660
He assaulted an officer.

351
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:29,761
So did you.

352
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:32,660
I'm sorry.

353
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,494
I'm sorry.

354
00:18:34,495 --> 00:18:37,827
I know you were just defending Vic.

355
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:38,926
[Sighs]

356
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,394
- But, um...
- What?

357
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,595
Barlow threatened my dad, Walt.

358
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:58,026
Where was Vic during all this?

359
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,060
She left before it all happened.

360
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,694
She went to check out that car

361
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:03,962
that Ridges' abandoned on Pike's Bridge.

362
00:19:07,795 --> 00:19:11,560
We have an unstable, violent cop

363
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,960
and the person who told on him,

364
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:17,193
both out there right now.

365
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,962
Does Vic know Branch is out?

366
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:21,962
No.

367
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,254
Walt, what's wrong?

368
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:57,121
Barlow managed to get Branch
released while I was out.

369
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:59,787
I thought, uh...

370
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:02,588
I thought Branch may come after you, so...

371
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:07,820
You get rid of one stalker,
here comes another one.

372
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:09,254
I wouldn't let that happen.

373
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,987
But, uh, still, with Branch out,

374
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:15,820
be better if someone
stayed home with you, so...

375
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,688
Vic: You mean, like, my husband?

376
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:22,688
Well, I didn't know if
he was traveling, so...

377
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,621
- No, he's around.
- Okay.

378
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:27,488
Okay, good.

379
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,521
Vic: Yeah.

380
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,087
So, how did it go with Nighthorse?

381
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:36,087
Well, he's sticking with his story.

382
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:38,854
Well, a ghost didn't drive this car, so...

383
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:40,187
Walt: Huh.

384
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,755
Even though I know he's lying,

385
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,920
we still can't prove that Ridges is alive

386
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:46,454
and working with Nighthorse.

387
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,488
- [Cellphone beeps]
- Walt.

388
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:50,721
The history on this phone

389
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:52,288
says that Ridges did call Branch.

390
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,388
But he also called someone else.

391
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,755
Call the Judge on your phone.

392
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,721
Tell him we need an arrest warrant.

393
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:01,854
[Cellphone beeps]

394
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:03,222
[Ringing]

395
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:11,054
Barlow: You know, I got a dry-aged t-bone

396
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:12,154
for dinner tonight,

397
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:13,787
but looks like we might

398
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:15,854
ought to put in on that eye of yours.

399
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:17,854
I'm fine.

400
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,054
[Chuckles]

401
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:22,954
- Hey, dad?
- Yeah.

402
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:24,755
I need to borrow the car.

403
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:27,221
Why?

404
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:29,854
I got a job to finish.

405
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,854
No, you don't.

406
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,421
You don't believe me, either.

407
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:37,121
Son, don't take this the wrong way,

408
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,121
but frankly, I don't care.

409
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:43,121
The way I see it, there
are two possibilities.

410
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:45,721
Either you're imagining all this,

411
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,087
in which case your
judgment can't be trusted,

412
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:52,154
or this David Ridges is still alive

413
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,321
and trying to kill you.

414
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:57,154
In either case, I can't allow my only son

415
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,987
to put himself back in harm's way again.

416
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:01,521
Now, come on in.

417
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:03,721
After you've had a shower and some sleep,

418
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,954
we'll work this out together.

419
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:07,988
Come on.

420
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:14,588
What's my pronghorn doing here?

421
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:17,588
I seem to recall paying
you good money for it.

422
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:23,288
Yes. And then you threw it away.

423
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:25,087
Oh, so you've been dumpster diving.

424
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:27,621
Is that, uh, really
what it's come to, Hank?

425
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:30,554
I think you know exactly
what position I am in.

426
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:32,621
After all, you put me in it.

427
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:35,655
Your man Darius forced
Deena to steal my money.

428
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:37,820
- You threatened...
- Wah, wah, wah, wah.

429
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:40,441
That's the trouble with most
indians. They're always whining,

430
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:44,288
trying to blame someone else
for their own misfortune.

431
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,787
"This man stole my money.
This man took my land.

432
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:50,188
This man moved up my trial date."

433
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:52,920
Hmm.

434
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:56,321
You know, if I pitied
myself the way you are now,

435
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:59,288
I'd still be in a 6x3 cell,

436
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:01,554
whining about who put me there.

437
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:05,187
Instead, I've decided to make my own luck.

438
00:23:05,188 --> 00:23:06,856
I suggest you do the same.

439
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:11,920
Oh, by the way, my offer
to buy the bar still stands.

440
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:15,021
[Chuckles] All cash.

441
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:17,954
[Whistles]

442
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,856
[Indistinct conversations]

443
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:26,152
[whispers] Jacob.

444
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,121
Uh, Jenine, call Malachi Strand.

445
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,636
Tell him we have an un-invented guest

446
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:33,421
that needs to be removed.

447
00:23:33,422 --> 00:23:34,954
Sheriff.

448
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:40,187
So sorry, but this is a private party.

449
00:23:40,188 --> 00:23:44,721
Feel free to grab a couple
of beers for the road.

450
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:46,288
Jacob Nighthorse,

451
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:48,073
you're under arrest for conspiracy,

452
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:49,617
aiding and abetting,

453
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:53,657
and accessory to the attempted
murder of Branch Connally.

454
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:56,421
Jenine, call my lawyer.

455
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:58,021
You are both gonna regret this.

456
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,288
I doubt that.

457
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:01,721
You have no evidence David is alive.

458
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,021
Nothing, except the fact

459
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:06,522
that you two spoke 17
times in the past 2 weeks.

460
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:09,512
Ridges is awful talkative for a dead man.

461
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,877
[Sighs]

462
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:22,676
I imagine it gives you great
pleasure to see me in here.

463
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:24,142
Walt: Your lawyer's on her way.

464
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:27,710
Till then, you have the
right to remain silent,

465
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,276
and I suggest you use it.

466
00:24:29,277 --> 00:24:31,809
You might be interested in
a few things I could say.

467
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,076
[Scoffs]

468
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:35,809
I would have been a few weeks ago,

469
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,909
but I'm a little tired of your denials.

470
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,076
I might be willing to revise my statements,

471
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:44,509
if you were to give me something.

472
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,875
What?

473
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:49,913
I realize there are laws against fraud

474
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:53,076
and making false statements.

475
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:55,085
You agree not to prosecute me for those,

476
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:58,009
I'll tell you what you want to know.

477
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,751
Fact is, I was just trying to help a friend

478
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:01,176
get out of trouble.

479
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:04,809
I had no intention of
helping him commit any crimes.

480
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:09,842
Well, if that's true, I'd
consider making a deal.

481
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,210
What do you want to know?

482
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:17,909
Well, you can start

483
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,376
by telling me about David's fake suicide.

484
00:25:20,377 --> 00:25:21,142
[Sighs]

485
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:24,443
David called me one
night, said he needed help.

486
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:26,476
I didn't know he was involved

487
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:29,376
in your daughter's accident at that point.

488
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:32,576
He just said that he
had made some decisions

489
00:25:32,577 --> 00:25:38,276
that he couldn't outrun, that
he had a plan to disappear,

490
00:25:38,277 --> 00:25:40,476
but required assistance.

491
00:25:40,477 --> 00:25:43,476
I know what that's like,

492
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:49,942
to be moving through the
world alone, no tribe,

493
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:52,777
so I agreed to help.

494
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:05,875
I'm going to take with
me everything that is bad,

495
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:08,309
and return with the true strength and honor

496
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,343
of the crazy dogs.

497
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,710
After that, we just waited.

498
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:29,309
All that was left was to explain
what happened to the body.

499
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,110
[Bird screeches]

500
00:26:31,977 --> 00:26:35,509
David stole some blood that
he'd donated at the Res Clinic

501
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,477
and poured it over the deer.

502
00:26:44,544 --> 00:26:49,644
After it was done, he promised
me that he would leave Wyoming.

503
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,376
But David didn't go.

504
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,376
Those legends he talked about,

505
00:26:55,377 --> 00:26:58,176
the... the... the crazy
dogs and the time travel...

506
00:26:58,177 --> 00:27:01,644
I thought all of that was him
just trying to sell his story.

507
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,076
But after he killed Hector,

508
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:11,576
I realized that David actually
believes in it... all of it.

509
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:14,909
He's convinced that he's
a time-traveling spirit,

510
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,476
sent to count coup against his enemies.

511
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:19,510
"Count coup"?

512
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:27,809
Indian warriors believe that
the greatest glory in battle

513
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,309
doesn't come from killing your enemy,

514
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:38,309
but from getting close
enough to touch a living enemy

515
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,042
and getting away to tell the tale.

516
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,976
Last time I talked to David,

517
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:46,243
he told me he was gonna
touch Branch three times

518
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:49,209
before he killed him.

519
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,476
I mounted an argument against
it, but David no longer listens.

520
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:58,610
You didn't think Ridges
was capable of all this?

521
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,042
I admit that my desire to help the man

522
00:28:07,043 --> 00:28:11,676
may have blinded me to his growing madness,

523
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:15,544
but then I'm sure you
know what that's like.

524
00:28:17,977 --> 00:28:20,343
So...

525
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,877
...do we have a deal?

526
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:29,142
No.

527
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:31,176
Walt!

528
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,443
I may not like you,

529
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,676
but you've always been a man of honor.

530
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:39,909
Surely you're not going
to go back on your word.

531
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,942
David called you 17
times in the last 2 weeks.

532
00:28:44,943 --> 00:28:50,009
Next time he does, you

Seems weird, you trying to take care of me.

541

I mean, you never even
held my hand as a kid

you and make your own choices.

Yep.

Uh... One of the
less-desirable parts of this job

short of process servers.

not kill Miller Beck.

when Miller Beck was killed,

630
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:40,946
then Cady could link them together

Miller Beck was murdered.

Well, Malachi might have told you that,
