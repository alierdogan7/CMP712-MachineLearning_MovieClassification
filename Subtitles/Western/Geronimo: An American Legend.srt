1
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,269
They'll fight a delaying action.

2
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:49,480
Twenty-five, thirty warriors, maybe.

3
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:51,399
Hundred women and children.

4
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:53,150
That's it.

5
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:56,403
The warriors will turn and fight.

6
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:58,447
-No avoiding that.
-No.

7
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:02,243
It'll give the women and children
time to take cover.

8
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:05,538
One thing for damn sure,
they already know we're here.

9
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,293
-Captain Ragsdale!
-Sir.

10
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,380
Troopers on the flat, form a line!

11
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,423
Company!

12
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,239
-Mr. Ragsdale!
-Sir!

13
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,365
Advance carbines.

14
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:47,244
Company! Advance carbines!

15
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:54,125
-Sound the march.
-Bugler!

16
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:32,369
The Chiricahua Apache
from the American Southwest...

17
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:36,541
...were the last of the great tribes
to defy the United States government...

18
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,669
...and its effort to impose
the reservation system.

19
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:44,257
The Army, under the command
of Brigadier General George Crook...

20
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:49,261
...was entrusted with the responsibility
of breaking this resistance.

21
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:54,308
His campaign ended the Chiricahua
strongholds below the Mexican border.

22
00:04:54,516 --> 00:04:56,727
Brought to a conclusion the conflict...

23
00:04:56,893 --> 00:05:00,188
...that had raged through the Southwest
for nearly two decades.

24
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:07,446
Tell old Nan and the others
we're not going to hurt them.

25
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,116
We're not going anywhere.

26
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:13,160
We don't want to fight.

27
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:16,496
We came here to bring you
to our reservation.

28
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,748
Tell your men that.

29
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,918
Nantan Lupan only wants peace
with the Chiricahua.

30
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:27,339
Live on the reservation.

31
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:31,176
Only one Chiricahua warrior
and his band of renegades held out.

32
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:36,013
Then, even he sent word that he would
give himself up in two months time.

33
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,141
He was called Goyakla.

34
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:41,394
But years before, the Mexicans
had given him another name:

35
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:43,521
Geronimo.

36
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,992
One month before my 22nd birthday...

37
00:05:57,076 --> 00:06:00,120
...l reported for duty
in the Arizona territory.

38
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,873
It was my first post into garrison life.

39
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,753
In looking back, it is now clear to me
that I was as much a stranger to myself...

40
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:10,256
...as I was to the great western desert.

41
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:12,425
My name is Britton Davis.

42
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:16,637
I was a participant in what the Army
later called the Geronimo Campaign.

43
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:21,308
It is my wish to throw some light upon
the extraordinary events that I witnessed...

44
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,393
...and on the men that lived them.

45
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:59,761
The beginning of my life
as a frontier soldier was at hand...

46
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:03,764
...and no amount of military training
could disguise the excitement I felt.

47
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,143
-Howdy.
-Welcome. It's good to see an army fellow.

48
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,570
Whiskey?

49
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,697
No, thank you, sir.

50
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,199
You don't have to 'sir' me, son.

51
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:23,951
I ain't no officer.

52
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,037
-Looks like you are, though.
-Second Lieutenant Britton Davis.

53
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:30,665
-At your service.
-Proud to know you.

54
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,043
Where you from, Lieutenant?

55
00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:36,045
Born in Texas, near Brownsville.

56
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,673
Texas? Why, hell, son,
I thought you was from back east!

57
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,550
Kind of got that manner about you.

58
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:44,137
Well, I been the last four years
at West Point.

59
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,847
-Senor.
-Yeah?

60
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,598
Soldados vienen.

61
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,761
My initial impression
of First Lieutenant Charles Gatewood...

62
00:08:26,844 --> 00:08:28,888
...remains distinct in my memory.

63
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:34,100
His brusqueness was entirely military,
balanced by unfailing good manners.

64
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:38,104
In his most matter-of-fact way,
he gave me my first order...

65
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,940
...as an officer
of the United States Cavalry.

66
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:43,442
I was to accompany him south.

67
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:45,861
We were going to bring in Geronimo.

68
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:49,073
He's due in a few days.

69
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:53,327
We'Il go on down to the border
and escort him to San Carlos.

70
00:08:57,456 --> 00:09:00,417
About 75 miles to the border
from here, Mr. Davis.

71
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,337
Plenty of time to get acquainted
with your new mount.

72
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:05,088
-Sir?
-Yes?

73
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,507
Just you and me?

74
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:12,095
The General figured that if we had
Geronimo we didn't need much protection.

75
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,179
Yes, sir.

76
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,684
A small detachment means
we're not threatening the hostiles.

77
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:21,063
You wouldn't want to pose a threat
to Geronimo, would you?

78
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,439
No, sir.

79
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:44,250
The Lieutenant was a man of confidence
and experience in the Apache wars.

80
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,296
In time I came to realise
he was much admired by his peers...

81
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,716
...much respected by his superiors.

82
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,310
That's the border, Mr. Davis.

83
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,106
-How will he find us?
-Easy. We're the only ones out here.

84
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,740
Lieutenant?

85
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,543
Apache medicine man.

86
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,381
Probably on a pilgrimage.

87
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:36,468
The Apaches, they believe in that power.
It's a kind of...

88
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,011
...spirit they carry inside them.

89
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:44,891
Sir, Geronimo's just going to come on in
and give himself up?

90
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,102
That's what he promised.

91
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:51,314
Chiricahua doesn't give his word much,
but when he does, he keeps it.

92
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,567
As long as you keep yours.

93
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:04,786
When the medicine man joined our camp,
I was filled with curiosity.

94
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:09,457
By personal inclination, Lieutenant
Gatewood kept his own counsel.

95
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:14,837
He met questions from an inexperienced
officer with patience and courtesy.

96
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:17,214
What fascinated me most...

97
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:21,343
...was his sympathy and knowledge
of all things pertaining to the Apache.

98
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,643
You don't talk to them much, do you?

99
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:31,354
To an Apache, stillness is a pleasure.

100
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:34,607
It's something they're taught
while they're young.

101
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,942
Helps someone who may have to
hide and wait.

102
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:41,237
What's he singing about?

103
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,572
Trying to locate Geronimo.

104
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:47,785
Says he'Il be here tomorrow.

105
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:49,536
On a white horse.

106
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,833
Superstitious, aren't they?

107
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,963
$5 says he rides in here on a white horse.

108
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:01,423
Just because the medicine man says so?

109
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,218
You've got a bet, Lieutenant.

110
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:07,221
Question?

111
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:11,725
These scouts that we have with us,
they're Apache.

112
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,395
Why would they work for the Army?
Fight their own kind?

113
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:19,274
There are lots of different Apache tribes
that don't much like each other.

114
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:22,235
Most of all,
Apache go where the best fight is.

115
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:25,279
It's a morality, once you understand it.

116
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:30,410
All right, l'Il see your $2...

117
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:33,830
...and l'Il raise you $1 .

118
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,835
Lieutenant, just curious:
are you a family man?

119
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:41,504
I have a son and a daughter.

120
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,088
They and my wife are back in Virginia.

121
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,384
-You must miss them.
-Every hour of every day.

122
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,149
Goyakla is coming.

123
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:47,983
Rides a white horse.

124
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,736
You owe me $5, Mr. Davis.

125
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:35,571
I heard you were wearing the blue coat.

126
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:38,282
I did not believe it.

127
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:49,334
Now I know your heart.

128
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:22,031
First Lieutenant Charles P. Gatewood.

129
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:27,703
It is good to see the great warrior.

130
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:34,710
You speak pretty good Apache.

131
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:38,881
Second Lieutenant Britton Davis,
Sixth Cavalry.

132
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:45,304
You are now under the protection
of the United States Army.

133
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,059
We will escort you
to General Crook at San Carlos.

134
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:54,437
Nantan Lupan waits for you
with an open heart.

135
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:12,037
They are something.

136
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:14,456
Chiricahua are special.

137
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,626
Even amongst the Apache.

138
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:37,561
The second night of our trek to San Carlos,
we put up at the Overland way station...

139
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:40,440
...at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains.

140
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:44,068
The following morning
I had my first opportunity to write home...

141
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:48,322
...being careful to include in the letter
an offhand reference to my participation...

142
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,199
...in the capture of Geronimo.

143
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:18,059
Two men are coming.
Man with white hat carries shotgun.

144
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,996
I'm looking for the officer in charge.

145
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:43,792
Lieutenant Charles Gatewood
at your service.

146
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:47,087
Heard the Army was travelling through
with hostiles.

147
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:50,298
Especially one hostile in particular.

148
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:54,677
City Marshal Joe Hawkins, Tombstone.

149
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:59,097
Apaches over yonder are under arrest.

150
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:02,976
I'm deputizing you to hold
these criminals until we get back...

151
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,853
...with a posse and a warrant.

152
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:08,314
These Apache are in our custody.

153
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:12,526
The warrant's going to specify
murder of white citizens...

154
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,783
...horse thievery and hostile lndianism.
Now, is that good enough for you?

155
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:22,620
We want to do what's right,
which is hang them.

156
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:26,207
I have orders to turn these Apache in
to General Crook.

157
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,668
The United States Army
doesn't need your help.

158
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,919
Lieutenant....

159
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:32,171
Don't sass me, blue coat.

160
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:41,721
Great Geronimo.

161
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:47,353
I think you're nothing
but a murdering red bastard.

162
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,697
I'd ride on if I were you, sir.

163
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:01,366
You seem to have provoked the hostiles.

164
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:05,911
And I don't think you want to get
into a contest with the Sixth Cavalry.

165
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,121
Let me tell you something.

166
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:11,958
Even the Sixth Cavalry is subject
to a Federal warrant.

167
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,003
Justice will be served...

168
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,088
...one way or the other.

169
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:19,133
Toothy.

170
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,739
Get the Apaches going, Mr. Davis.

171
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:46,783
Now.

172
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,118
Sir.

173
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:59,546
We moved north with all possible speed...

174
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:02,925
...but our pack mules prevented us
from making good progress.

175
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:08,137
Around 4:00 in the afternoon,
we caught sight of the Tombstone Posse.

176
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,943
Faced with the potential enemy
that possessed superior numbers...

177
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:25,821
...Lieutenant Gatewood hit upon
an unusual tactic.

178
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:27,698
He divided his forces.

179
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:31,702
He sent me ahead with the others,
while he and Geronimo remained behind.

180
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:33,870
The lieutenant had two objectives.

181
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:36,998
First, to attempt
a rear-guard protective action.

182
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,170
Second, and most important,
never to lose sight of Geronimo.

183
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,304
Easy, steady!

184
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:10,029
What you seeing, Davy?

185
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:12,114
Looks like some of them split off.

186
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,034
Six or seven of them headed
to San Carlos...

187
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,329
...other two up yonder.

188
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:29,048
That's more of a lynch mob than a posse.

189
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:35,888
But if they serve those warrants,
l'm going to have to give you up.

190
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:40,559
You have a good long glass, Gatewood.

191
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:45,230
If I scare them off...

192
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:47,607
...we trade.

193
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,584
I can't let you kill any of those men.

194
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,384
That was a great shot.

195
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,345
Not so great, I aimed for his head.

196
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:55,005
We best catch up to Mr. Davis
and the others now.

197
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,556
This your name?

198
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,016
Gatewood?

199
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,184
Yes.

200
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,270
A gift from my troops.

201
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:14,565
They must think you're a fine chief.

202
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:17,276
No.

203
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:20,237
Not a chief, just a soldier.

204
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:28,453
Your glass much better than mine.

205
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:37,671
Blue stone is valuable to Apache.

206
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:55,229
Well, thank you.

207
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,504
The following afternoon,
we arrived at the military base...

208
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:24,506
...of operations at San Carlos.

209
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,467
This afforded me my first glimpse
of General Crook...

210
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:31,513
...who the Apache called Nantan Lupan,
Grey Wolf Chief.

211
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,893
Our arrival was laid out
with great military ceremony.

212
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,396
The surrender of Geronimo
was no small event.

213
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,525
General.

214
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,444
My compliments, Lieutenant.

215
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,877
Nantan Lupan.

216
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,764
It does my heart good
to see you, Geronimo.

217
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,016
I accept your surrender.

218
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,935
I accept the surrender of a great warrior.

219
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:27,650
Now, let's have a cup of coffee
and smoke a cigar.

220
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:30,194
Got a lot to talk about.

221
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:35,032
It's old Geronimo.

222
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,081
Good to see you, ain't it?

223
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,458
You know my friend, AI Sieber.

224
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:48,379
Yeah. I was always hoping
to catch up to you myself, but...

225
00:25:49,171 --> 00:25:51,506
...l guess l'Il never get that chance now.

226
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,890
-Mr. Sieber.
-Lieutenant.

227
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,611
I see you have your cigar and coffee.

228
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:17,031
Lieutenant Gatewood told me
of your trip up from the border.

229
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:18,866
Sounds like quite a story.

230
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm glad to see that Geronimo's
a man of his word.

231
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:27,707
Washington's ordered me
to detain you here for a short period...

232
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:32,211
...and then send you and your band
of Chiricahua on to Turkey Creek.

233
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:35,423
We keep our rifles for hunting.

234
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,050
Yes, but only on the reservation.

235
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,553
I'Il put one of my officers in charge there.

236
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:42,597
Gatewood.

237
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:50,479
No, l'm sorry, Lieutenant Gatewood
is a company officer.

238
00:26:50,563 --> 00:26:52,398
He has his responsibilities here.

239
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,900
Then we take Davis.

240
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:57,528
I like Davis.

241
00:26:57,736 --> 00:26:59,988
I'm sure Mr. Davis will be a fine officer...

242
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:02,532
...but I had somebody
more experienced in mind.

243
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,701
I like Davis.

244
00:27:10,623 --> 00:27:14,253
-What do you think, Lieutenant?
-I'm sure it will be his privilege...

245
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:16,213
...as well as his duty.

246
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:18,090
Mr. Davis, it is.

247
00:27:18,548 --> 00:27:21,218
To be accompanied
by a small detachment of soldiers.

248
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,972
The Apache will be under the protection
of the United States Army.

249
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:30,684
Mr. Davis is young.

250
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:35,271
Young Apache, young White-Eye,
the hope of the West.

251
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,734
Gatewood.

252
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:41,944
You come visit me.

253
00:27:42,153 --> 00:27:43,572
I would like that.

254
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:46,283
I hope the wars are over, my friend.

255
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:49,536
Nantan Lupan wants the Chiricahua
to learn to be farmers.

256
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,079
It's their only chance.

257
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:52,872
They must change.

258
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:55,249
The old days are gone.

259
00:27:56,709 --> 00:28:00,755
Nantan Lupan says there must be
no leaving this reservation...

260
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,340
...even for a few hours without permission.

261
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:07,344
There must be no drinking
of whiskey or Tizwin.

262
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:11,265
Any violations of these rules...

263
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,019
...will result in confinement in an Army
prison stockade.

264
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,369
He want to know why these rules.

265
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,287
Why they be punished?

266
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:38,582
What you care if Apache drink?
Soldier drink.

267
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:46,382
Nantan Lupan says
if Apache drink, Apache fight.

268
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,884
Apache get into trouble.

269
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,552
It's bad for everyone.

270
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:53,388
It's bad for the Apache,
it's bad for soldiers...

271
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:55,182
...bad for all the White-Eyes.

272
00:29:04,983 --> 00:29:08,653
Say, why, if some Apache do bad things,
all are punished?

273
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:14,408
That will not happen.

274
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,916
All Apache should not be punished
for the mistakes of only a few.

275
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,505
We will determine who is responsible
and only those few will be punished.

276
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:46,355
Six weeks after I took up residence
at Turkey Creek, Lieutenant Gatewood...

277
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,565
...and AI Sieber came to visit.

278
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:54,030
Sieber, as Chief of Scouts, was in charge
of recruiting Apache for the Army.

279
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,882
Hello there, Mangas.
Just the fellow I want to see.

280
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,803
I want you to join the Army, all right?

281
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:22,015
Wolves with blue coats,
scouts to help us fight the renegades.

282
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:26,478
You'Il be a sergeant, wear a blue coat,
stripes on your coat, with Army pay.

283
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,189
I don't know, Sieber.

284
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:32,150
Well, you are a warrior. You hunt men.

285
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,236
You'Il make your woman,
make your children proud of you.

286
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:38,947
Mexicans, they took my wife, my little boy.

287
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:43,534
Maybe the Army could help get them back.

288
00:30:48,831 --> 00:30:50,666
I think maybe I stay here.

289
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:59,300
If I was asking you out on a raiding party,
I expect you'd be a lot more willing.

290
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:13,647
Federal government had forced
over 500 Chiricahua...

291
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,983
...to take up residence
within Turkey Creek's narrow borders.

292
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:22,947
Corn was the main crop, but the land
was not fertile enough to be self-sufficient.

293
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:28,996
The Chiricahua became dependent on
government supplies for their well-being.

294
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:34,292
Gatewood. You come to visit me.

295
00:31:36,586 --> 00:31:39,005
Makes my heart glad to see Geronimo.

296
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:44,384
How's the life of a farmer?

297
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,761
Some Apaches are good farmer.

298
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:51,432
Others miss the old way.

299
00:31:56,063 --> 00:31:58,065
I'm not good farmer, Gatewood.

300
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:11,244
I have come here to visit my friend...

301
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:14,747
...but I have some questions
I need to ask you.

302
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:19,752
There are rumours that a medicine man
is speaking against the White-Eye.

303
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:24,631
That he is calling for a return
to the war trail.

304
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:32,223
It was told by a medicine man...

305
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:36,393
...many more Apache would die
fighting White-Eye.

306
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:40,105
And in the end...

307
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,607
...we will win because we will die
free of them.

308
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:50,781
Is the only way for an Apache to be free...

309
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:52,699
...to die?

310
00:32:58,455 --> 00:33:01,583
Well, which medicine man is this?
I should talk to him.

311
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:04,169
Find out what he's saying.

312
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:08,632
There are many.

313
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,551
Some have the power.

314
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:13,887
Some just talk.

315
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:16,180
He's a warrior.

316
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:18,182
Every bit born in battle.

317
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:22,144
Fighting a lost cause.

318
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:24,146
I'm familiar with the type.

319
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:28,942
My two older brothers and my father
fought for the Army of Northern Virginia.

320
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,904
My oldest brother was killed.

321
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:33,489
My father was wounded, crippled.

322
00:33:35,658 --> 00:33:39,412
After the war, he took me aside and said,
'You'Il carry the new flag.'

323
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:42,081
Sent me off to the Academy.

324
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:45,833
First of my family
north of the Mason-Dixon line.

325
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:50,796
So, like our friend,
I know what it's like to hate the blue coat.

326
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,759
Before the White-Eye came
we had a good life.

327
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:02,975
Now we are forced to stay
on this tiny piece of land.

328
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:09,565
The White-Eye do not understand
the way of the Apache.

329
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:14,903
The medicine man at Cibecue
is called the Dreamer.

330
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,283
He says the dead chiefs will rise.

331
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:25,121
He says the Apache
are the true keepers of the land.

332
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,959
I will go to him.

333
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,257
I want to hear his words.

334
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:41,929
Today while Gatewood talked with me,
I looked into my power.

335
00:34:44,974 --> 00:34:47,226
I saw a white horse running.

336
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:50,645
I saw signs of war.

337
00:34:58,027 --> 00:35:00,529
Nothing so concentrated
the bureaucratic mind...

338
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:04,784
...in dealing with the lndians as rumours
of a troublesome medicine man.

339
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:08,454
When a religious leader
showed up among the tribes...

340
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:12,625
...preaching doctrines perceived to be
dangerous, the government policy...

341
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,544
...was to have the Army
deal with it immediately.

342
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:42,988
I am here by order of General Crook.

343
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:45,532
Nantan Lupan.

344
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:51,703
The dead chiefs
will not rise if you are here.

345
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:57,167
The White-Eye must leave.
I pray this will happen.

346
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:20,773
This dance is a demonstration
hostile to the citizens of the United States.

347
00:36:21,607 --> 00:36:24,735
And this demonstration
is unlawfully assembled.

348
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,821
I order you to stop at this instant!

349
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:33,660
Stop that!

350
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:35,662
Stop him! Arrest him!

351
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,091
Watch it!

352
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:55,889
You didn't have to shoot him, goddamn it!
I can handle this myself!

353
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:58,225
-What's he got there?
-He had a rock!

354
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:01,770
He has not done nothing!

355
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,897
We're not bothering no one!

356
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:05,398
You leave here!

357
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:06,691
You leave us alone!

358
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:09,152
Arrest him! Arrest Geronimo!

359
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:13,490
Where is your heart?

360
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,205
Arrest Geronimo! Arrest him!

361
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:16,523
-David never really--
-General Crook. Telegram, sir.

362
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:19,319
Pardon me.

363
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,959
Get a staff officer to me immediately.

364
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:38,378
Captain Ragsdale. Now!

365
00:39:50,224 --> 00:39:51,141
General?

366
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,852
Geronimo's jumped Turkey Creek.

367
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:55,520
The Apache are out.

368
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,273
It all blew up at Cibecue.

369
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:01,401
Whole damn thing is a shambles.

370
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:05,362
Geronimo has taken
half of the reservation with him.

371
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,239
Men, women and children.

372
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,409
Spread the word.
All officers to their commands.

373
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,660
Yes, sir.

374
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,040
Geronimo had quickly divided
his forces into small bands...

375
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,334
...each headed for Mexico.

376
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:07,129
By the day after Cibecue,
Crook had five columns in the field.

377
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,966
The Geronimo Campaign had begun.

378
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,301
On the point!

379
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:15,053
Circle back!

380
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:46,750
Sir?

381
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:49,378
Yes, I see them, Mr. Davis.

382
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:51,213
Steady in the rank.

383
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:52,589
Go slow.

384
00:42:04,518 --> 00:42:06,353
Beg your pardon, sir.

385
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:08,063
Do we attack?

386
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,648
Hold the column.

387
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:11,107
Sergeant!

388
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:12,650
Steady in the rank!

389
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:13,984
Steady!

390
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,528
-Sergeant.
-Column halt!

391
00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:21,340
Whatever happens,
the Apache will take off.

392
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:23,759
Don't let the column pursue at speed.

393
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:27,429
Whenever you can,
you choose your ground to fight on.

394
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:00,419
Chato?

395
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:02,923
What the hell is going on?

396
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:06,259
Raiding party, split off from Goyakla.

397
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:09,846
Apache challenge Gatewood
to come out and fight.

398
00:44:10,472 --> 00:44:13,433
Want to show off power
to other Chiricahua.

399
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:09,252
Chato.

400
00:46:14,048 --> 00:46:16,383
Is there anything that should be done?

401
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:09,976
Geronimo's band had gone east
into the copper mining country...

402
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,478
...of the low hills.

403
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:14,689
His tactics were resupply
at the expense of the civilians...

404
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:17,066
...who had settled on Chiricahua land.

405
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,552
This is Apache land.

406
00:47:47,011 --> 00:47:49,638
This has always been Apache land!

407
00:47:50,014 --> 00:47:53,142
We ain't never done nothing to you.
I mean, it ain't right.

408
00:47:53,225 --> 00:47:55,018
Stop crying, damn it!

409
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:57,312
He's going to kill you anyway.

410
00:47:59,022 --> 00:48:01,066
We make things out of this country!

411
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:04,903
There was nothing here before us,
there'd be nothing if we left it to you.

412
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:28,426
You are a fool...

413
00:48:29,968 --> 00:48:32,137
...but at least you are brave.

414
00:48:33,972 --> 00:48:35,807
Get off Apache land.

415
00:48:36,683 --> 00:48:39,602
The next time, I will kill you.

416
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:54,951
Detail halt!

417
00:48:55,076 --> 00:48:57,870
-Troops, right, straight!
-Left, right, face.

418
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:29,276
'The Apache known as
Dandy Jim and Skip-Hey...

419
00:49:29,484 --> 00:49:33,195
'...have been found guilty by the
Military Court, Department of Arizona...

420
00:49:33,278 --> 00:49:35,405
'...of insurrection at Cibecue Creek.

421
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,824
'The Apache Dead Shot...

422
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,370
'...Sergeant, Military Scouts,
Sixth Cavalry...

423
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:45,957
'...been found guilty of treason.

424
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:49,753
'The sentence of the court
for the three prisoners...

425
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:51,588
'...is death by hanging.'

426
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,594
Do any of you have anything
to say to me as Chaplain?

427
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,597
Are any of you Christians?

428
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:04,559
Nantan Lupan...

429
00:50:06,352 --> 00:50:08,062
...l give you my hat.

430
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:12,566
Maybe you think my wife, my baby.

431
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:25,037
Don't trust the White-Eye.

432
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,543
With them there is no right way.

433
00:50:35,254 --> 00:50:38,048
I am not afraid of their preacher.

434
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:42,678
The One God will welcome me.

435
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:33,034
There's three of them.

436
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,620
The driver should be nearby.

437
00:52:38,498 --> 00:52:41,625
They didn't have to kill them
just to get their horses.

438
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:43,877
No, they didn't.

439
00:53:10,778 --> 00:53:14,323
AI Sieber had had his wound
from Cibecue cauterised with a hot poker...

440
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:17,075
...and was back in the saddle
the following day.

441
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:20,078
All told, he had suffered
17 gunshot and arrow wounds...

442
00:53:20,203 --> 00:53:22,539
...in his many years of fighting Apache.

443
00:53:22,956 --> 00:53:25,875
The General wants to deploy me
and Dutchy to your column.

444
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:31,548
How's that wound, Mr. Sieber?

445
00:53:31,673 --> 00:53:32,925
Which one?

446
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,968
Down here, here, here, here?

447
00:53:35,385 --> 00:53:38,346
Hell, l'm in real good.
Ain't slowing me down none.

448
00:53:38,847 --> 00:53:42,183
We came across an overland.
Four dead, horses gone.

449
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:45,978
If they've burned
two spreads off to the west...

450
00:53:46,311 --> 00:53:49,481
...they've picked up horses,
food, a lot of ammunition.

451
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:53,234
I figure l'Il just keep tracking off
to those hills there.

452
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:56,696
All right.

453
00:53:56,779 --> 00:53:59,782
Mr. Davis, you and Sergeant Mulrey
stick with Mr. Sieber.

454
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:03,412
Be sure that he gets back
to the column by sundown.

455
00:54:03,495 --> 00:54:04,538
Yes, sir.

456
00:54:30,145 --> 00:54:31,939
That raiding party is real close.

457
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:33,691
Yup.

458
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:39,571
I want you to ride for the column.

459
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,865
Bring them back to pick up this trail.

460
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:44,534
On the double, pronto, go on,
get out of here!

461
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,693
You take him!
