00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:20,253
To the Yukon.

they're hungry for gold.

10
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:36,886

Who wouldn't?

the local tribe up here

20
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:54,087
think the land is theirs.

21
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:58,458
I spend my time thinking
about more lucrative things,

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,259

Count: Forgive me,
Father, for I have sinned.

24
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,629
When did you commit these acts?

25
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,714
Well, I haven't yet.

26
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:05,715
You got a day to vacate.

27
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,050
We didn't kill your friend.

28
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:08,751
That's not good enough.

140
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,785
we need more wood in a bad way.

Without more wood, that
bench is gonna give,

153
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,872
and that's eight weeks
of digging gone south.

154
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:46,175
I'm up against a vein. I know it.

155

Miners are always up against a vein.

158
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:55,734
This claim is different.

159
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,054
That superstructure falls in on itself...

160
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,692
I don't know if I got the ability to wait
out till spring to start building again.

161
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:05,945
By "ability" you mean "money."

162

163
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,532

I ain't in the business of charity.

167
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:16,922
You got a stake in that claim, too.

168
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,740
That bothers you, doesn't it?

169
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:21,677
It makes you wonder whether

170
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,880
I had something to do with Epstein's death.

171
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,465
In terms of my stake in that claim,

172
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,351
I have no interest in mining,
as I've always maintained.

173
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:32,021
What I have is an investment in Joe Meeker.

174
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:34,190
[Chuckles] And why is that?

175
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:36,025
He's a cousin.

176
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,777
He's a walking, talking,
two-legged labrador.

177
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,481
Don't need much more than
a bone to keep him happy.

If that bone is a half a stake in a claim,

179
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:48,070
I ain't averse to keeping Joe Meeker happy.

180
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:03,302
- What if I put up my half?
- [Chuckles]

181
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:07,122
Two halves of nothing.

182
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:08,891
That's just what I need.

183
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,427
A lot of speculation about this claim.

184
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,148
And even if you don't believe in it,

185
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,317
it'll sell for something
on the open market...

186
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,402
for more than the price
of the wood I'm asking.

187
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,605
You're either stupid or
you got way too much faith.

188
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:25,324
Hold it...

189
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,142
- [Paper taps]
-... For a week.

190
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:30,779
That's all it's gonna take
for me to get to that vein.

191

[Indistinct conversation]

192
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,548
But after a week, if you
don't pay back the loan,

193
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,600
I will sell it.

194
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,303
Capital does me no good
tied up there in the claims.

195
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:57,139
It has to be down here in Dawson.

196
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,564
These properties are all too nice.

197
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,316
See, I don't want nice.

198
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:10,069
What I'm looking for is shit...

199
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:12,404
shit that you can polish
up and then make nice.

200
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,190
That's real estate. You understand?

201
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:16,858
Superintendent: A word with you.

202
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:21,080
I heard you threatened the priest.

203
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,299
There will not be any murder in this town.

204
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,717
Do you understand?

205
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,219
Well, you and I both know
there's gonna be murder.

206
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,537
This is the wilds.

207
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,139
A lot's gonna slip through the cracks

208
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:31,590
for us as a law-enforcement unit.

209
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:34,593
We got 10 men to police
200 square miles of claims.

210
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:36,895
We got to pick our
priorities, what to protect...

211
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,047
that starts with church.

212
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:40,382
You're Catholic, are you?

213
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:41,734
It's another institution

214
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,652
that can help civilize this town.

215
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:44,937
You stay away from it.

216
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,572
Faster than you know what hit you,

217
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:48,157
I'll put a cage around you.

218
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:54,029
I might not have to kill him myself,

219
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:56,749

220
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:59,234

You shoot my friend?

00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:13,766
Why?

225
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:17,720
You're not going to get
an answer out of him.

226
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:19,888
But you can take solace in the fact that,

227
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,641
one way or another, he'll see justice.

228
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,226
A problematic word.

229
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,227
How so?

230
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:27,613
Justice for us is hanging a killer.

231
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,148
Justice for them is maybe

232
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,899
fighting off people taking their land.

233
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:33,485
All we get is a couple of
dead men. Who's the wiser?

234
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,204
That's a pretty even-keeled response.

235
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,789
I'd think you'd be seeing red.

236
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,291
Oh, I'm seeing plenty.

Says he prefers it to
the white man's water.

241
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,790
Must have been a hell of a shot

242

Ain't exactly made for marksmanship, is he?

244
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:03,015
One way or another,
we'll find out the truth.

245

Man: A little higher. A
little over to the left.

246
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,660
Guy buys a mortuary, and now
he's looking to add to it?

Up there?

248
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,214
Who buys a cemetery?

249
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:37,015
Belinda: I don't think
he bought a cemetery.

250
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,168
I think he bought dirt.

251
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,171
I don't like people buying
dirt next to my dirt.

252
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:45,274

talking about putting up

- Let him.

that ain't location.

What are you getting at?

262

Front street isn't exactly

263
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,003
a model of sanitation, now, is it?

264
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:17,172
That's why he's buying up there.

265
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:19,040
Do you think he's planning
on making a new downtown?

266
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,710
It's exactly what I'd do.

267

I want to talk to them first.

Tell them I'll pay more than the Count.

270

The Count pays cash 100%.

from miners, too many IOUs.

We'll send them up.

Don't give me that look.

723
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:03,000
I gave you a chance.
You could have cashed in.

724
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:05,353
Save it, leech.

725
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:08,005
I'd rather be a leech
than an idiot, friend.

726
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:10,108
A leech's never hungry.

727
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,476
Idiot.

728
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:14,112
Well, g... go find yourself lunch...

- Hey, hey!

733

735
00:47:27,827 --> 00:47:29,794
No, it ain't. I got a contract.

Soapy: Yeah, well, in case you can't see,

737
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:34,415
I'm holding that contract now,

738
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:37,635
and since you can't pay the
balance due this very day,

739
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:39,870
I am ordering you to vacate.

740
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:42,039
You do not have the funds.

741
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:44,091
That's where you're wrong, Soapy.

We are fully funded.

00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,729

like a coffin lid closing,

748
00:48:17,932 --> 00:48:20,065
and we will be alone with death.

749
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:22,184
God isn't fooled

We're no different than the coyotes.

We are predators.

755
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:44,039
Creatures of fortune and
circumstance, that's all.

756
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,675
God, no.

757
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:50,462
There's no end to them.

He is the mudslide. He is
the typhus-ridden mosquito.

that I feel his grace.

I feel him pulling me to him.

766
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:25,547
I can feel it coming... a storm.

767
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,716

Yes.

00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:39,711
Whom have you killed?

773
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:43,732
A wandering Jew.

774
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:46,268
A young man with the sap

Not when it's God's
own gravity pulling you.

Like the rain out of the
sky, it just happens...

We decide we're going to
have a little fun with him.

Now, the man is standing with
his back to a mirror, see,

829
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,137
and we tell him, "if you turn your
head really fast toward the mirror,

00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,139
you can see the back of your head."

[Chuckles] Then we see him.

00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:34,436
When he thinks nobody's looking,

837
00:52:34,438 --> 00:52:36,888
he's whipping his head around like this.

838
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,074
He does it every three seconds or so.

And you say that why?

845
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,763
Because I've spoken to the murderer.

He's a white man.

I don't know his name or his face.

It was in the darkness of the confessional.

850
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:13,987
And the bond of the confessional
prevents you from saying more,

- no doubt.
- Yes, sir.

He's over there.

903
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:07,568

Got to be the same one that killed Epstein.

910

They want the mine.

911
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:35,713
That's the problem with property
rights in this territory.

912
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:37,965
If the claim owner dies, his next of kin

913
00:56:37,967 --> 00:56:40,217

914

the claim's up for grabs.

If both you and Mr. Meeker had died,

918
00:56:48,728 --> 00:56:50,311
that mine would be a free-for-all.

919

923
00:57:12,868 --> 00:57:16,720

the killing to someone.

- Heard him.

seen and heard in that space.

It was weak of me.

I accept your apology.

943

You were right, what you said.

944
00:58:34,617 --> 00:58:36,834
I guess maybe you saw it in my face.

It's what we whores do.

anything to me, Superintendent?

It's not catching, is it?

It's time we had a conversation.

956
00:59:17,843 --> 00:59:19,660
You've been bad ever since I've known you,

957
00:59:19,662 --> 00:59:22,162
but things have taken a turn for the worse.

958

You want to be the real estate
baron in Dawson, I'll let you.

961
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,609
All I care about is the Fairview Hotel.

962
00:59:35,611 --> 00:59:37,645
I'm willing to let you buy me out.

963
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:40,314

my properties on front street.

965

So I can keep the Fairview
construction afloat.

966
00:59:45,688 --> 00:59:48,689
Front street properties are
a swamp. I don't need them.

see when they dock in Dawson.

day, I pull in $1,000,

1079
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:45,042
A little thing like a fever?

1080
01:10:45,044 --> 01:10:48,112
You'll just kick it aside.

1081
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:54,585
I'm tired of kicking.

1082
01:11:05,097 --> 01:11:09,400
My mama used to do this
to me when I was sick.

1083
01:11:11,302 --> 01:11:14,188
It must be nice,

1084
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:17,658
having someone you love do that for you.

What else did your mama do?

1088
01:11:28,821 --> 01:11:30,454
She talked...

1089
01:11:30,456 --> 01:11:31,922
[Sniffles]

1090
01:11:31,924 --> 01:11:34,875
and told me everything she was doing...

1091
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:37,628
"I'm changing the sheets.

1092
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,347
I'm airing out the room."

1093
01:11:39,349 --> 01:11:42,433
[Laughing] Like I couldn't see her.

1094
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:45,386
Sometimes she sang to me.

[Sniffles]

1096
01:11:49,025 --> 01:11:52,143
[Voice breaking] No,
I'm not singing to you.

- Is there any chance?
- She went days

1101
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:19,387
with the disease skulking
through her body like a wolf.

1102
01:12:19,389 --> 01:12:23,140
Most people wouldn't even be able to walk.

1103
01:12:39,608 --> 01:12:41,659
She'll be all right.

1104
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,861
She's tougher than rubber.

1105
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:50,367
Arm's feeling better.

1106
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:53,421
Won't get better without help.

Doctor help, you mean.

1108
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:59,844
We got to get you to the mainland.

1109

Ferry leaves day after tomorrow.

1110
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:04,265
- You're going to be on it.
- And what about you?

1111
01:13:04,267 --> 01:13:06,851
What about the mine?

1112
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:08,936
The season's up, Meek.

1113
01:13:08,938 --> 01:13:11,272
It's the last ferry of the year.

1114
01:13:11,274 --> 01:13:13,757
You ain't answering my question.

1115
01:13:13,759 --> 01:13:16,093
What about you? You don't go, I don't go.

1116
01:13:16,095 --> 01:13:18,395
Don't be stupid.

1117
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:23,868
That arm don't heal right,
you're crippled for life.

1118

You don't go, I don't go.

1119
01:13:34,913 --> 01:13:38,499
I'll get us both tickets.

1120
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,251
How about that?

1121
01:13:44,506 --> 01:13:46,090
You'd do that?

1122
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:49,226
If it gets you out of here. [Sniffles]

1123
01:13:49,228 --> 01:13:50,794

Her fever's broke.

1138

She might make it.

Must have nodded off. [Clears throat]

She all right Belinda?

1145

That's dog. I'd recognize
his voice anywhere.

He's gone back to the wild.

You're gonna be on that ferry.

[Dog barking]

I've collected a lot of stories.

Don't have much meaning
unless people hear 'em.

Put me in one of them, will you?

1160
01:17:41,335 --> 01:17:43,635
I'll think about it.

1161

But right now...

[Indistinct conversations]

Well, I suppose they're up
the street at Belinda's mill.

1167
01:18:12,917 --> 01:18:15,650
She's suddenly selling her wood on credit.

1168
01:18:15,652 --> 01:18:18,370
That helps her how?

1169
01:18:18,372 --> 01:18:20,706
For a woman so desperate for hard cash,

1170
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:24,159
selling on credit helps her exactly how?

1171
01:18:24,161 --> 01:18:27,096
Well...

1172
01:18:27,098 --> 01:18:30,099
it helps her keep the
customers away from here.

Why?

Well, so I can't pay you lot.

1178
01:18:49,369 --> 01:18:52,404
Sundown and his boys ain't the
type you want to be in hock to.

And yet I get the sense that

1184

your mind is a whole world away, thinking.

I'm working out something
that don't have a solution.

Well, not much point in
thinking about it, then.

1187

Thinking about how to
ferret out a murderer.

1188
01:19:46,292 --> 01:19:48,910
How would you do that?

1189
01:19:48,912 --> 01:19:52,130
Is that why you sent your friend away?

1190
01:19:52,132 --> 01:19:55,750
Keep him away from whatever
nastiness you were planning?

1191
01:19:57,253 --> 01:19:59,021
Something like that.

1192
01:20:03,309 --> 01:20:06,261
I ain't as innocent as him.

1193
01:20:06,263 --> 01:20:08,814
So?

Now, that's not what you got,
but still, it's every penny I had.

You know, you can't be certain it was him.

1198
01:20:21,945 --> 01:20:24,296
Well, there's one way to find out.

1199

We find him.

We make him talk.

we're gonna sit right back here

01:24:39,553 --> 01:24:41,035
[Sighs]

1254
01:24:41,037 --> 01:24:42,971
Jesus.

1255
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:50,562
<i>Sometimes friendships, even new ones,</i>

1256
01:24:50,564 --> 01:24:52,597
<i>are the only solace we have,</i>

1257
01:24:52,599 --> 01:24:56,217
<i>even if the moment is only fleeting</i>

1258
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,237
<i>and the worst storms are yet to come.</i>

1259
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:09,030
Bill: A murderer walks amongst us.

1260
01:25:09,032 --> 01:25:10,532
That's not God's plan.

1261
01:25:10,534 --> 01:25:11,867
It was Goodman.

1262
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:12,868
Wasn't it?

1263
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:14,419
[Breathes deeply]

1264
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:18,540
Count: The good lord saw fit
to put all that gold down there.

1265
01:25:18,542 --> 01:25:20,125
And now, men are just yanking it up...

1266
01:25:20,127 --> 01:25:21,793
Oh!

1267
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:22,928
Men like Bill Haskell.

1268
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:24,930
I say we go and pay him a little visit.

1269
01:25:24,932 --> 01:25:27,799
I want you to work for me.

1270
01:25:29,185 --> 01:25:31,887
<i>Tonight, there will be no words,</i>

1271
01:25:31,889 --> 01:25:33,254
<i>only blood.</i>

1272
01:25:34,423 --> 01:25:36,725
I seen that look. The killer look.

1273
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:38,226
The Yukon got you.

1274
01:25:38,228 --> 01:25:40,779
Yukon gets to all of us sooner or later.

1275
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:44,149
[Grunts]

1276
01:25:46,068 --> 01:25:48,453
Bill: If they're hanging him
for the death of my friend,

1277
01:25:48,455 --> 01:25:49,821
they got the wrong guy.

1278
01:25:49,823 --> 01:25:53,325
Where is it?

1279
01:25:53,327 --> 01:25:54,609
Was it worth it?

1280
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:55,961
Sabine: Count and his men...

1281
01:25:55,963 --> 01:25:58,947
they was going after Bill Haskell.

1282
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:00,448
Well, this is a bit of a predicament.

1283
01:26:01,283 --> 01:26:02,283
[Breathing heavily]
