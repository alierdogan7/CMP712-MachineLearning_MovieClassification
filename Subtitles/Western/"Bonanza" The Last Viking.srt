I ain't stuck in the mud.

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,971
You're a mountain man,
ain't you?

19
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,513
Why you get that funny hat,
sonny?

20
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,505
I don't think it's funny.

00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,922
(laughing)

22
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,118
Mister, you're
going to pick that hat up.

23
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,718
Uh, you going to make me
pick up that hat?

24
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,231
You get down off that horse.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,509
Well, big mouth,

26
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,638

Nephew?

I am your Uncle Gunnar.

Hey, Pa!

Come see who's come to see us.

43
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,707
What'd you say?

44
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,642
Hello, Benjamin.

45
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,445
How long
since the last time I see you?

46
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,247
20 years?

47
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,583
Hey, you got a touch of snow
around your ears, like me.

48
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,152
Gunnar... Gunnar Borgstrom!

49
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,587
(laughing raucously)

50
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,256
What a wonderful surprise!

51
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,358
What are you doing
around this part of the world?

52
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,759
Oh, I go lots of places.

53
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,894
You know that, Benjamin.

54
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,263
Who are you?

55
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,664
I'm Adam, Uncle Gunnar.

56
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,266
You don't remember me, do you?

57
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,934
Ah, little Adam.

58
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,836
Not anymore.

59
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,605
We got another brother now,
Uncle Gunnar-- Little Joe--

60
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,109
but he's off visiting
some friends--a female friend.

61
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,777
Gunnar, where you headed?

62
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,246
Oh, who knows? Dakota, Canada.

63
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,382
A few compadres follow
this old Swede

64
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,150
to the north
to seek their fortune.

65
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,551
Ah, compadres, eh?

66
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,986
Yeah, men like myself.

67
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,688
Men with no ties, no roots.

68
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,657
We make camp in the mountains.

69
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,192
How come they didn't ride down
with you, Uncle Gunnar?

70
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,029
Because they ain't so sociable
as me--that is why.

71
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,632
I ride all these miles
just to see my relatives.

72
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:03,536
Uh, maybe my sister's husband
invite me for supper, huh?

73
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,038
Oh, Gunnar, please forgive me.

74
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,673
In all the excitement...
Of course, of course.

75
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,840
You'll have supper with us.

76
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,175
- Come on in.
- Ah, good.

77
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,643
Maybe I'll take a bath,
too, huh?

78
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,712
I think maybe I don't smell
too good at supper.

79
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,704
(all laughing)

80
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,561
I eat different from you, <i>ja?</i>

81
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,730
You... You eat a lot,
that's for sure.

82
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,299
I think a pig have better
table manners than me.

83
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,235
But I spent my life
in <i>brazos de Dios,</i>

84
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,339
in the arms of God,
under the stars, like an animal.

85
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,841
You sure been lots of places,
ain't you?

86
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,378
Since I last seen your father,
I been in 26 countries

87
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,814
across five oceans.

88
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,982
26 countries and five oceans.

89
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,317
You hear that, Adam?

90
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,653
I sure did.

91
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,589
That was an Indian lance
you were carrying, wasn't it?

92
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,524
That pig sticker? <i>Ja.</i>

93
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,460
I got that
from a Comanche chief.

94
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,295
He didn't have
no more use for it.

95
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,063
Maybe because he was dead, <i>ja?</i>

96
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,532
(Gunnar chuckles)

97
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,235
You, uh... you fight
the Comanches, Uncle Gunnar?

98
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,636
I fight anybody.

99
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,772
You ought to know that
by now, my nephew.

100
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,608
BEN: Uh, Gunnar, you, uh...
you say you, uh...

101
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,743
you fought the Comanches.

102
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,244
Do you ever trade with them?

103
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,614
Well, when we don't fight,
my compadres and I, we trade.

104
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,982
Why you ask?

105
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,417
Oh, I was...
I was just wondering

106
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,220
if you ever ran across
a bunch of, uh,

107
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,223
renegade buffalo hunters--
Comancheros.

108
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>Ja, ja,</i> I...
I have heard of them.

109
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,061
Pretty wild bunch, I hear.

110
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,896
They raid
the white settlements,

111
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,965
and then they trade off
the goods to the Comanches.

112
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,400
Is that so?

113
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,835
Maybe... Maybe that's why
they call them Comancheros.

114
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,338
I, uh...
I never seen none of them.

115
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,330
(knocking at door)

116
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,616
<i>- Buenas tardes.</i>
- Hello.

117
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,244
Ah, there is my compadre.

118
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,221
<i>Buenas tardes, señores.</i>

119
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,724
I thought maybe I'd find you
under this roof, Oso.

120
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,726
What you doing here, Vaca?

121
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,895
It gets very cold
on the mountain sleeping,

122
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,063
and my s-serape is very thin.

123
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,532
I thought maybe, uh...

124
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,434
Oh, we have some extra blankets
you could use.

125
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,768
He don't need none.

126
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,170
It's all right.

127
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,162
I'll get them.

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,642
Oh, you must be a very rich man

129
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,804
to own such a
<i>magnifico hacienda.</i>

130
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,914
You get back to camp,
Vaca, pronto.

131
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,715
VACA:
And you, Oso--

132
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,717
when are you coming back
to camp, huh?

133
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,153
I go when I am ready, Vaca.

134
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,889
Maybe you like it so much
here with your relatives,

135
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,925
you're going to stay, huh?

136
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,193
Oh, <i>gracias.</i>

137
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,894
I gonna sleep good tonight.

138
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,297
I very much enjoy
meeting you rancheros.

139
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,333
Maybe, eh, <i>primero,</i> Vaca will
meet you again sometime, huh?

140
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,893
- VACA: <i>Adios.</i>
<i>- Adios.</i>

141
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,182
I'm... I'm sorry
that one come here.

142
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,518
Oh, that's all right.

143
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,352
I gotta keep a strong hand
on that one.

144
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,928
Well, the food
was good, Benjamin.

145
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,530
I go now.

146
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,131
- So soon?
- HOSS: Hey, wait a minute.

147
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,867
Hey, Pa, how come he can't stay
in that extra bedroom?

148
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,668
There ain't no use in him going
back out on that mountain.

149
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,303
Well, of course, he can.
He'll sleep the night here.

150
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,605
Oh, no, no.

151
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,673
- I don't, I don't think so, no.
- Oh... of course you will.

152
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,975
- Oh, come on.
- Why, it's cold up there.

153
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,710
We'd, uh... we'd be glad
to have you.

154
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,345
Well, uh, where would I sleep?

155
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,746
Right there,
in that extra bedroom.

156
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,881
You make yourself at home.

157
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,415
There we are.

158
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,085
Well, uh...

159
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,686
all right.

160
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,188
Ah, good.

161
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:47,193
I, uh... I don't sleep
in a fine house for a long time.

162
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,295
If I snore, you pound
on the door, <i>ja?</i>

163
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,163
- (laughing): Yeah.
- We'll pound hard.

164
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,155
Good night.

165
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,343
Well, that's quite an uncle
we've got, Hoss.

166
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,678
He sure is.

167
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,147
Sure hate to have him
get riled up at me.

168
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,950
You know, he reminds me
of an old Viking.

169
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,451
Yeah.

170
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,755
I'll bet you Uncle Gunnar would
like being called a Viking.

171
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,191
The Vikings were
ruthless raiders and killers.

172
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,558
Not much better
than the Comancheros.

173
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,333
Come on, we got a lot of work
to do tomorrow.

174
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,165
Let's get to bed.

175
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,237
(door opens and closes)

176
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,972
<i>Ja?</i>

177
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,651
Well, Benjamin.

178
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,828
The last time I see you
was at the funeral.

179
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,863
Yes.

180
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,966
Yes, that's right.

181
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,036
She was a good woman,
my sister.

182
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,038
Yes.

183
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,308
She was... a good woman.

184
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,043
A wonderful wife.

185
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:16,315
We have much fun, Inger and me,
when... when we were young.

186
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:21,554
And all I had in my mind
was dreams of glory and gold.

187
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,457
It is good to dream
when you are young, Benjamin.

188
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,293
Oh, you can dream
when you're older, too.

189
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,529
Yeah, but now, when the fur
is flying and the iron is hot,

190
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,064
there is no time to dream.

191
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,066
No, the fur was always flying
with you, Gunnar.

192
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,968
I remember you as a boy.

193
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,670
(chuckles)
Always had to have a...

194
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,839
a new pot of devil's brew
every day.

195
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,441
Not just as a boy; all the time.

196
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,478
All the time,
I need a good, strong life.

197
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,113
A man's life.

198
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,749
Reap the rewards
and pay the piper when he calls.

199
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,240
That's Gunnar Borgstrom.

200
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,021
(Ben sighs)

201
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:59,025
You ever... you ever lonely?

202
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,028
Lonely? Lonely for what?

203
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,230
Oh... companionship.

204
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,631
A woman.

205
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:09,502
I never... never lacked
for the company of women.

206
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,003
(chuckles)

207
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,406
But you, uh...
you never got married.

208
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,408
Marry? Gunnar?

209
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,711
I was not cut out for fathering
and farming, Benjamin.

210
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,747
I had to move-- move with
the turn and tide of things--

211
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,884
not sit on my backside
like a Yucatán turtle.

212
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,286
Well, I-I never exactly

213
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,689
considered myself
a Yucatán turtle.

214
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,158
Oh, you ain't, Benjamin,
you ain't.

215
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:36,395
You got a... a good ranch here;
fine boys.

216
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,432
It's... It's just the Almighty
didn't cut us all

217
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,833
in the shape of plowmen.

218
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,935
You... You can't plant

219
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,904
a roving man's feet
in the earth.

220
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,140
Mm... maybe that's because a...

221
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,410
a roving man doesn't want
to stand still long enough

222
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,879
to take a look at himself.

223
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,120
I ain't a young man now,
Benjamin.

224
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,925
And I got no regrets for the
sins I commit in this world.

225
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,195
I see what I want
and I take it.

226
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,965
And I'm not going out on my back
begging forgiveness from nobody.

227
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,366
Gunnar...

228
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,698
now why did you come here?

229
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:31,650
I come to see
my sister's boy; my blood.

230
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,520
Maybe... Maybe I don't
get no other chance.

231
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,128
I am tired now, Benjamin.

232
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,731
I... I go to sleep now.

233
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,393
Yeah.

234
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,831
Good night, Gunnar.

235
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,032
Benjamin.

236
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,606
Do you ever dream, Benjamin?

237
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,551
Well... yeah, sometime.

238
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,221
I always have the same dream.

239
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,724
It's night.

240
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,427
Black and velvet, it is.

241
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:21,167
And there's a warm
August wind blowing.

242
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,502
And it's on a great ship, I am.

243
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,640
And I'm flying with that wind

244
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,041
over a smooth sea,

245
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,978
chasing a wisp of a small boat.

246
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,148
It always seems to...

247
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,786
to hold
its lead far ahead of me.

248
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,120
And so dark it is.

249
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,861
So dark, I...

250
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,330
I can't make it out.

251
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,569
But somehow I know, I know...

252
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,006
I know I got to catch it.

253
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,887
(wolf howling in distance)

254
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,431
Vaca, my friend,
did you find <i>El Oso?</i>

255
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,999
<i>Si,</i> I found him...

256
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,134
visiting with his relatives.

257
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,136
Stuffing his face
with good food

258
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,839
while we sit up here
and eat dry bread.

259
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,441
When do we move?

260
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,444
Gunnar say we would
find fat picking here.

261
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,012
Promises, promises.

262
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,914
That's all he does anymore,
promises.

263
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,317
It has been a month since
we have made a good raid.

264
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,152
I trust Gunnar.

265
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,988
He's been
a good leader to us.

266
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,990
Ah! He's an old woman,

267
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,025
warming himself by the fire.

268
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,094
Is that the kind
of leader you want?

269
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,196
I do not care who leads us

270
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,099
just so we raid and get rich.

271
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,668
We will raid, Duzzaq.
I promise you.

272
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,370
And we will get rich, too.

273
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,506
And the first fat goose
we will pluck

274
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,374
will be the Ponderosa.

275
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,643
(rooster crowing)

276
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,691
Morning, Uncle Gunnar.

277
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,159
You sleep good last night?

278
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,895
I sleep good, I sleep good.

279
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,397
That mattress
is chucked plumb full of

280
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,098
real goose feathers, you know.

281
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,099
Goose feathers!

282
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,467
I got off them goose feathers.

283
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,769
I sleep on the floor.

284
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,271
I ain't so used
to goose feathers as you.

285
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,774
I reckon we are getting a little
soft around here at that.

286
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,642
Hey, how about me showing you
around the Ponderosa

287
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,843
before you leave?

288
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,479
We ain't had much of a chance
to get to know each other.

289
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,815
It ain't every day that a man
just finds an uncle.

290
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,085
Sure, sonny, I guess
I got the time.

291
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,146
Maybe I don't come back again
so soon, <i>ja?</i>

292
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,458
Yes, sir, I... I sure would like

293
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,393
for you to meet Little Joe
before you leave, too.

294
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,595
He... He's over at the McClanes,
helping them build a fence.

295
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,359
He ought to be back any time.

296
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,804
Aren't you even gonna
stop work long enough

297
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,305
to have a drink of water?

298
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,908
Carrie, just looking
at you is more refreshing

299
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,977
than anything you've
got in that bucket,

300
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,379
but, uh, I can use
some of that, too.

301
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,183
Your flattery, Little Joe,
is exceeded only by your ability

302
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,451
to build a fence.

303
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,186
Since you walked
all the way out here,

304
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,220
why don't you stay awhile,

305
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,688
let me show you
what I've done?

306
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,156
Oh, I know what you've done.

307
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,525
Uncle Abe has been singing
your praises all morning.

308
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,862
He thinks you're just about
the finest thing there ever was.

309
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,566
And, uh, how about you,
what do you think?

310
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,968
Well, I told you I was glad

311
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,803
you came over
to help out, didn't I?

312
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,905
Mm-hmm.

313
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,841
Is that the only reason
you're glad?

314
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,442
You know it isn't.

315
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,111
It's just that
I want you to know

316
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,112
I think it's wonderful

317
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,614
the way you and your pa
and Adam and Hoss

318
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,950
have helped uncle Abe
and me since we've been here.

319
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,519
Oh, it's pretty easy to help
a man like your uncle,

320
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,287
especially when he's
got a beautiful niece

321
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,522
to say thanks for him.

322
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,359
I think you're a flatterer,
Little Joe, just like your pa.

323
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,461
Thank you, ma'am.
We try to please.

324
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,197
Can't you ever be serious?

325
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,566
You know how proud
we are of your uncle.

326
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,435
He's done a lot more
with this place

327
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,669
than we ever thought possible.

328
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,406
Because you Cartwrights
have helped him, Little Joe.

329
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,474
He was so discouraged
when he came here:

330
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,244
the drought and the wind
and crop failures.

331
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,080
We had such big dreams.

332
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,948
Well, I think his biggest dream
was raising you

333
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,583
after your folks died.

334
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,152
He's done a real fine job.

335
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,586
Hasn't been easy for him.

336
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,655
Sometimes I feel
I've been a burden.

337
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,925
Hey, you better not
let him hear you say that.

338
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,361
He's proud
as a peacock of you...

339
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,463
I'd say with good cause.

340
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:49,468
I feel guilty about you
working around here so much.

341
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,868
Mm-hmm.

342
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,012
I wouldn't mind becoming

343
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,776
the permanent fence-fixer
around here.

344
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,789
There it is, Uncle Gunnar.

345
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,225
Ain't that the prettiest
little pond you ever saw?

346
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,061
Yeah, this a good place.

347
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,163
A quiet place.

348
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,064
Pretty as a pond I never see.

349
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,774
Uncle Gunnar...

350
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,176
there's something I been wanting
to ask you.

351
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:35,080
You know, I was just a little
feller when my mother died.

352
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,450
I don't remember much about her.

353
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,988
Pa's tried to tell me
everything he could, but...

354
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,758
well, I... I thought maybe,
you being her brother,

355
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,061
you could...

356
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,963
you could add something to it.

357
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:56,034
Well, we didn't
get along so good.

358
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,504
I... I was a wild one

359
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,773
and, uh, she didn't
like that so much.

360
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,576
But she had a soft heart,
that girl.

361
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:08,380
Pa says she sure was pretty.

362
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,651
Great big blue eyes
and blonde hair.

363
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:17,356
Ah, blonde as the snows
of Dalerner.

364
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,424
But it ain't good
to talk about the dead, sonny.

365
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,094
You-You can't bring nobody back
once they're gone.

366
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,197
No, I reckon you can't.

367
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,434
I guess that's why I want to
know as much about you as I can

368
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,103
before you have to leave.

369
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,472
You want to know about me?

370
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,508
You wouldn't like
what I had to tell.

371
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,210
Maybe I wouldn't.

372
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,179
Then, again, maybe I would.

373
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,739
I think you wouldn't.

374
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,519
Uncle, Gunnar,
what you gonna do in Canada?

375
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,955
Canada?

376
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,757
Yeah. That's where you're
going, ain't it?

377
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:55,427
Oh, <i>ja, ja, ja.</i>
<i>Ja,</i> I think I go there.

378
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,363
Why don't you stay here with us?

379
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,801
Because I ain't no
Yucatán turtle, that's why.

380
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,469
You ain't no what?

381
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:08,507
I got to move with the tide
and turn of things,

382
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:13,745
so I... I don't have
to take a good look at myself.

383
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,082
<i>Ja,</i> this is...

384
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,184
this is a good place, sonny.

385
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,380
It's quiet here.

386
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,862
Well... you fellows
have a good ride?

387
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,131
Sure did, Pa.
I took him out by the lake.

388
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,366
Yeah?

389
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,134
That's a pretty good mud puddle
you got up there, Benjamin.

390
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,136
- (Ben laughs)
- Hey, what you doing there?

391
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,405
Oh, making a new batch of soap.

392
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,975
We make our own
out of hog lard and lye water.

393
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,410
It's a little bit strong, but
it sure will get you clean.

394
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,747
Well, what did you think
of the Ponderosa?

395
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,951
Well, I think if you work hard,
you can have what you want, too.

396
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:57,122
Yeah... Gunnar, do you have
what you want?

397
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,691
<i>Ja,</i> I got what I want.

398
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,793
Pa, Hoss and I gotta
get at that hay,

399
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,996
and I think I'll ride
over to McClanes'

400
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,431
and remind little Joe that
he has work around here, too.

401
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,699
Oh, he'll be back pretty soon.

402
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,534
Well, I got to go now, boys.

403
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,838
You got a fine ranch here,
Benjamin, and fine boys.

404
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,408
Well, Gunnar, it was wonderful
seeing you again. Wonderful.

405
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,442
<i>Goddag,</i> Benjamin.

406
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,610
Good-bye, Uncle Gunnar.

407
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,612
<i>Goddag,</i> Adam.

408
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,481
Bye, Uncle Gunnar.

409
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,549
I wish you could have
met Little Joe.

410
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,617
Well, them compadres,

411
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,686
they vamoose without me,
if I don't show up.

412
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,455
And I got to hear
other saddles creaking

413
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,224
besides my own.

414
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,886
Good-bye.

415
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,869
I don't remember giving
no orders to move out.

416
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,847
You didn't give it. I did.

417
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,616
You think you're man enough

418
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,918
to be the padrone
of these Comancheros, Vaca?

419
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,588
Sure, I ain't got no relatives.

420
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,257
What does that mean?

421
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,860
When a man got ties,
he gets soft in the belly.

422
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,263
I ain't got no ties.

423
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,754
No?

424
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,306
These hombres, they eat your
dust all the way from Taos

425
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,175
because they believe
what you tell them.

426
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,409
They begin to wonder now

427
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,211
if what you tell them is
the truth.

428
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,548
When I get ready to strike,
I will tell you.

429
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,084
The Comancheros,
they are beginning to think

430
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,019
maybe you're getting
a yellow streak.

431
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,364
The bear makes a big growl, huh?

432
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,265
But how sharp are your claws?

433
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:54,072
Is <i>El Oso</i> a man
of strength and power?

434
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,508
Or is he a tired old <i>viejo</i>

435
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,943
who should lie down and die?

436
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,478
I ain't dead yet, Vaca.

437
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,912
Prove it.

438
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,715
The big plunder is down there--
the Ponderosa.

439
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,817
The Ponderosa
would not be easy to loot.

440
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,086
There are too many men there.
It would be dangerous.

441
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,622
I spit on them!

442
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,624
What is danger
to the Comancheros?

443
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,959
I, Efemerno Vaca, I tell you,

444
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,560
we are going to raid
the Ponderosa!

445
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,728
(men cheer)

446
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,263
I give the orders here!

447
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,499
Why did you bring us
to this valley, huh? Why?

448
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,335
So we could sit still in
the middle of all this wealth

449
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,604
while you go visiting
your <i>parientes?</i>

450
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,606
There are other ranches
in this valley.

451
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,574
We seen one in the foothills

452
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,009
we could take
with our hands tied.

453
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,579
So you are tired of waiting, <i>ja?</i>

454
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,249
Your blood is hot

455
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,786
and you wait for the word
of your padrone.

456
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,356
Well, I give you that word.

457
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,358
We raid that ranch
in the foothills.

458
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,793
(men cheering)

459
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,659
Get the horses
ready to move out!

460
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,437
I hope you're real hungry,
Little Joe,

461
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,038
because I baked an apple pie.

462
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,406
An apple pie, huh?

463
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,541
Don't you like it?

464
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,806
Like it?
It's my favorite dish.

465
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,585
<i>Vamanos, amigos!</i>

466
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,060
(whooping, gunfire)

467
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,504
Wait.

468
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,030
(gunfire)

469
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,175
Oh!

470
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,871
Carrie, wait!

471
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,544
Stop!

472
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,866
(laughing)

473
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,902
Is this your sweetheart,
my little mosquito, huh?

474
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,736
If he ain't, maybe I can
be your sweetheart, huh?

475
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,048
No! No!

476
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,018
What's your name, <i>muchacho?</i>

477
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,353
What's it to you?

478
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,855
I want to put
on your tombstone.

479
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,725
I don't want you to lie
in a grave which is unmarked.

480
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,928
Yeah, well, the name's
Cartwright--Joe Cartwright.

481
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,196
Be sure
to put it in big letters,

482
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,220
so everybody can read it.

483
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,637
You say you got no ties, huh?

484
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,206
So maybe we take one of your
relatives for hostage, huh?

485
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,909
I mean, you say you don't
care about them, right?

486
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,144
He ain't no relative of mine.

487
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,545
He say his name Joe Cartwright.

488
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,176
Get up, sonny.

489
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,228
I don't know no Joe Cartwright.

490
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,229
Tie them up.

491
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,431
We take them back to camp.

492
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,595
<i>Andale, pronto!</i>

493
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,344
(indistinct chatter)

494
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,452
There's nothing
to be scared of.

495
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,087
They're going to let us
go pretty soon.

496
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,956
No, they won't.

497
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,725
They'll kill us.

498
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:36,127
Like they killed Uncle Abe
and Mr. Crager.

499
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,762
Carrie, don't start
thinking that way.

500
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,230
If they were going to kill us,

501
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,632
they would have done it
back there.

502
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,500
Come on.

503
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,104
(speaking Spanish)

504
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,007
I'm so tired, Joe.

505
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,306
I wish I could sleep.

506
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,147
You like some <i>cafecito?</i>

507
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,283
I'm sorry if you're
not very comfortable.

508
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,751
Save your breath.

509
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,086
You're gonna need it

510
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,921
when half this country
comes looking for us.

511
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,623
Why are they looking for you?

512
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,324
You something special?

513
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,627
Your papa's
a very rich man, huh?

514
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,961
<i>Importante.</i>

515
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,429
Yeah, <i>importante.</i>

516
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,798
Yeah, enough to have the sheriff
and 200 mountain men

517
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,933
down on your back.

518
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,101
(chuckles)

519
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,770
I do not think
your papa do that, <i>muchacho.</i>

520
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,540
Your papa got too many
relatives to worry about.

521
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,509
What relatives?

522
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,178
Him.

523
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,547
He's your papa's brother-in-law.

524
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,350
You're a liar.

525
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,285
No, I tell you
the truth, <i>muchacho.</i>

526
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,821
That old bear-- he's your uncle.

527
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,790
He's visiting with your papa

528
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,326
while you were visiting
with your sweetheart.

529
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,994
(chuckles)

530
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,225
You sure you don't want
some <i>cafecito?</i>

531
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,068
Get the men
to lighten the wagons.

532
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,603
We move out tomorrow.

533
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,697
I don't want any junk
slowing us down.

534
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:03,375
Oso... why don't you
tell them who you are, huh?

535
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,152
He said you were my uncle.

536
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,520
Maybe I am.

537
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,722
What difference would it make?

538
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,223
Ask him.

539
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,426

Gunnar Borgstrom.

540
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,162
Gunnar Borgstrom...

541
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,897
Hoss's uncle?

542
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,866

543
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,437
Wait!

544
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,505
No, you ain't no uncle of mine.

545
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,341
You couldn't be.

546
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,708
You're a filthy murderin' skunk.

547
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,016
You got a big mouth,
like your brother Hoss.

548
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,019
I just can't believe it.

549
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,122
He's been talking about you
ever since we were kids.

550
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,623
I don't need any of his talk.

551
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,525
Now, that's right, you don't!

552
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,984
The only thing you need is a box
big enough to bury you in!

553
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,379
I have been
with <i>El Oso</i> a long time.

554
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,982
I see something in his eyes
that ain't been there before.

555
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,250
Like what?

556
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,522
Like pain... where there is
no wound, no blood.

557
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,657
Maybe he's sick.

558
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,227
<i>Si.</i>

559
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:26,197
With a sickness which drains
a man of his fire.

560
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,966
He's dying, my <i>compadres.</i>

561
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,130
He's dying of conscience
and remorse.

562
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,273
Soon he will crawl into his hole

563
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,442
and shut off the world
behind him.

564
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,677
Then why we not
just wait and see?

565
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,947
Because it is dangerous
to those around him

566
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:48,453
and because I want to see him
squirm before he dies--

567
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,390
squirm in his belly,
in his heart.

568
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,560
Duzzaq...

569
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,129
find me a <i>culebra.</i>

570
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,597
A snake?

571
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:02,834
With an angry face
and death in his mouth.

572
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,703
<i>El Oso</i> does not like snake,
you know that.

573
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,672
I know that very well.

574
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,208
We're going to have some fun.

575
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,906
Maybe we watch the big bear
dance tonight.

576
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,385
(struggling to call out)
...Ben!

577
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,274
It's Abe McClane, Pa.

578
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,009
Is he alive?

579
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,979
Just barely.

580

00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:47,739
I bring you His Majesty,
the king of the chamiso bush--

589
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,765
monsieur rattlesnake.

590
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,243
(drunken chortling)

591
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:01,219
Duzzaq... I bet you
five dollars he goes north

592
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,087

593
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,555
And I bet you...

594
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,659
I bet you five dollars
he goes south.

595
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,128
(all guffawing)

596
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,129
Hey, Duzzaq,

597
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,131
where did you get
that chicken snake?

598
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,832
Hey, don't let him
out of that bag,

599
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,100
or we'll all be dead chickens.

600
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,436
He's no chicken snake!

601
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,606
He's 100% rattler

602
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,843
and he can spit and strike
like the devil.

603
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,778
Duzzaq.

604
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,972
There he goes.

anything to you, huh?

608
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,379
Look at him, my compadres.

609
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,049
Sweating like a stuck pig.

610
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,987
I ain't taking no more orders
from this old woman.

611
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,591
His orders are to protect
his <i>parientes,</i> not us.

612
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,794
From now on,
I give the orders here.

Look like I shoot
the wrong snake.

614

00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,250
Carrie, are you sure?

706
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,964
Where'd it happen?

707
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,267
He's back there in some rocks.

708
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,268
(crying)

709
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:52,269
Come on.

710
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,270
No, Hoss!

711
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,805
- Carrie, now, you listen to me.
- No!

712
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,774
I ain't gonna leave you here,
and I ain't turning back.

713
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,943
Now, you come on, you hear?!

714
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,139
- Come on now!
- All right.

715
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,494
I used to lay in bed at night,
when I was a little boy,

716
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,163
wondering where
my Uncle Gunnar was,

717
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,132
wondering what he was doing.

718
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:26,003
I told you you would not like
what I had to tell.

719
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,205
You killed Little Joe.

720
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,207
And uncle or no uncle,
I'm gonna kill you.

721
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,308
Oh, no, Hoss, no!

722
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,140
You stay out of this!

723
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,840
(both grunting)

724
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,349
(straining)

725
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,909
(Hoss and Gunnar
grunting, struggling)

726
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,290
(groaning)

727
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,770
(gun cocks)

728
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,984
Hoss!

729
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,283
Look, Hoss!

730
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:57,227
Oh, Joe!

731
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,896
(gasping)

732
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,397
Are you hurt bad, Joe?

733
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,466
Hey, punky...

734
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,568
I thought
they done killed you, boy.

735
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:05,736
No, not this time.

736
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,404
(panting)

737
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,407
It was your uncle, Hoss.

738
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,576
Yeah, I know.

739
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,745
He saved our lives.

740
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,980
And then he helped us get away.

741
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,284
I tried to tell you, Hoss.

742
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,985
VACA:
Amigos!

743
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,654
I'm going to kill you, amigos.

744
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,856
Don't move.

745
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,826
I know the old man pretty well.

746
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,128
When I kill you,
he will die, too.

747
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,496
(Vaca chuckles)

748
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,828
Vaca!

749
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,434
Don't move, old man!

750
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,169
Don't move!

751
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,504
You move, I-I will kill them.

752
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,773
Take your choice, Vaca.

753
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,332
Them or me.

754
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,670
(groans)

755
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,043
(groans, moans)

756
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,450
I just didn't understand,
Uncle Gunnar.

757
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,754
Don't you go getting stuck
in the mud, sonny.

758
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,724
Sometimes it's...

759
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:37,361
it's not so easy to get out.

760
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,329
Don't talk.

761
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,833
I'm not asking forgiveness
from... from nobody, you hear?

762
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,001
I hear.

763
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,971
What I done,
I done because I wan... wanted.

764
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,643
It's the strength in man.

765
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,546
Yes, sir.

766
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,037
(grunts weakly)

767
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,985
Forgive me, sonny.

768
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,544
For...

769
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,884
Sheriff tells me the
Comancheros have pulled out.

770
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,085
Posse's after them.

771
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,748
Uncle Gunnar liked this place.

772
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,949
Said it was peaceful, quiet.

773
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,264
Said it was a "gud" place.

774
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:51,602
Eh, I guess that's what he was
always looking for--

775
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,537
peace and quiet.

776
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,776
That little boat that was always
just out of his reach.

777
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,904
What little boat?

778
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,907
Oh... boat he was always
dreaming about.

779
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,058
Pa...

780
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:18,729
you said that it wasn't possible

781
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,098
for a man to see inside
another man

782
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,761
deep enough to know
what he was really like.

783
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,776
I think I did,
just before he died.

784
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:37,281
Come on, he-he wouldn't
want us to mourn over him.

785
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,849
No.

786
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,841
No, I reckon he wouldn't,
at that.

787
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:50,118
He just wasn't
that sort of man, was he?

788
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,819
ANNOUNCER: <i>This has been</i>
<i>a color presentation</i>

789
