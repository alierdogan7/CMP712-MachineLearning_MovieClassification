1
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,960
This is the Territory of Wyoming

2
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,080
the year 1866.

3
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,480
On this soft sunlit day
of early Summer,

4
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,560
men of two different worlds
have come together to talk.

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,440
There is bitterness,
suspicion and distrust.

6
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,760
You remember your friends and
loved ones who have been killed.

7
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,840
You've seen the bones of
settlers on the trail

8
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,640
and the bleached ribs
of their wagons.

9
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,240
And still they come, pushing West
with a vision.

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,800
A vision of farm and town
on land they can call their own.

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,920
They come to reclaim the
wilderness under your protection:

12
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,680
the Army of the United States.

13
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,920
And in your hearts and minds
there is also bitterness and hate

14
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,400
because you also
have a vision

15
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,040
of sacred hunting grounds
silent and empty

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
of buffalo, elk and beaver.

17
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,400
Your food, clothing and shelter

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,360
vanished forever.

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,139
Of starvation and sickness
where once there was plenty.

20
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,360
This is the Laramie Conference

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,920
a powder keg that may
explode at any moment.

22
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,840
It would take little
to light the fuse.

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,600
There are important
and powerful men here.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,240
On one side,

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,040
The leaders of the Sioux Nations.

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,000
On the other side,
representatives of the US.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,400
On this day, it will take
a great man to see both sides.

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Jim Bridger, pioneer,
trapper and scout

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,920
is such a man!

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,440
If I remember right this is the
4th time the American government

31
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,640
has talked treaty with the Sioux.

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,840
The first treaty pushed the Sioux
back into Wyoming,

33
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,880
then we pushed him back further.

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
Last year we shoved him back
some more into the river basin,

35
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,960
in the country east
of the Big Horns.

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,560
That was supposed to be final.

37
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,400
Mr. Bridger, we're not discussing
previous treaties.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,403
I am Mr. Davis.

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm sorry but I am talking
previous treaties.

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,360
I rode over 200 miles to say my say
and it'll get said my way.

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,480
You're planning to build a road
over a trail Bozeman mapped out

42
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,200
that runs through the middle of
the Sioux's last hunting lands.

43
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,240
Gold has been discovered in Montana.
Thousands of people are waiting.

44
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,280
But if wagons and troops start
moving up that road,

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,800
that's the end of the buffalo
in Wyoming,

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,720
and that's the end of the Sioux.

47
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,840
The buffalo means everything
to these people. Their food,

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
their clothing, skin for tipis,
bones for weapons.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
We've been told it's
the only feasible route.

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,880
You've been told wrong Mr. Davis.

51
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,680
Last year Bozeman and
I ran a race with wagons.

52
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,640
He went over his trail, I over
one they call the Bridger trail

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,520
west of the Big Horns,
outside Sioux Territory.

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,800
34 days to get to Virginia City,
just two days longer than Bozeman.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,680
If we want peace with these
Indians it'll cost us something.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,360
The Sioux has already paid plenty
we can pay 2 days extra travel.

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,480
Sounds feasible.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,760
- Now we'II...
- One moment gentlemen.

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,080
Before you're swept off your feet
you should consider

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
where Mr. Bridger's sympathies lie.

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,680
Monahseetah is Cheyenne.
She's from Kansas.

62
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,480
The Powder River country
is of no concern to her.

63
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,920
But she is of great concern to you.

64
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,947
And your friend Sol Beckworth,
hasn't he lived among Indians?

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,480
Chief Two Bears asks,
if no one will listen to Bridger,

66
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,240
will they listen to anyone else?

67
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,800
The purpose of this conference
is to reach an agreement.

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
Tell him we're here
in all good faith to...

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,920
In all good faith?

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,440
That the American Cavalry's
been ordered to build a fort

71
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,400
above the Powder River?

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,760
Are Col. Carrington and his men
here to prove your good faith?

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,640
- Who told you?
- Mr. Bridger,

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,882
one of these chiefs
may know English.

75
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,200
I am Sioux Chief.

76
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,400
I am called Makhpiya Luta,
which means "Red Cloud".

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,960
I understand and speak your language.

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,440
I understand even
what you do not say.

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,360
We certainly didn't expect
to keep the fort a secret.

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,440
No, we would have learned of it
after we signed the Treaty.

81
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,520
See this warrior of
the Great White Father.

82
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
You pretend to parley with us
for a road through our lands,

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,518
but soldiers are here to steal
a road before we say yes or no.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,440
- What did he say?
- What did he say Mr. Bridger?

85
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,920
He said the white man's promises
are written in water.

86
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,640
In other words, he said
you're a pack of liars

87
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,292
and this peace conference is a fake.

88
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,280
- Does this mean they'll fight?
- Not exactly.

89
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,240
Though the Sioux have been betrayed
Red Cloud said they want peace.

90
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,800
- But if war is forced on them...
- Forced? Meaning the Fort?

91
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,640
No, you can put through your road
and you can fortify it,

92
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,000
but if one white man kills one Indian,

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,471
that road's gonna come
unraveled in your face.

94
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,642
Jim! Beckworth!

95
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,400
Jim, how did you know
about the fort?

96
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,240
We put a few rumors together.

97
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,880
They didn't order your outfit
out of Kansas for nothing.

98
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,880
- How many going altogether?
- One cavalry troop,

99
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,880
a squad from the Quartermasters,

100
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,480
four officer's wives including
Mrs. Carrington and six young ones.

101
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,360
Don't you know Red Cloud has
the whole Sioux Nation under him?

102
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,720
- The Oglalas, the Brules...
- 4,000 fighting men easy.

103
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,200
It's not a military expedition.
We're going to maintain a fort.

104
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,520
We'll provide escort for wagons,
carry mail and things like that.

105
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,120
I still need good scouts.

106
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,560
- What about you two?
- I'm through scouting for the Army.

107
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,200
Can't make a living at it.

108
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Five dollars a day and your keep?

109
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,170
Five dollars? It'll cost you more
for whiskey to drown the boredom.

110
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,000
Beck's afraid I'll back out
on our fur trading deal.

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,040
We're expecting a lot of
Indian villages this year.

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
Why not join us later?

113
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,522
Fur trading's pretty slow
by the middle of summer.

114
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,851
Sergeant, get those wagons rolling.

115
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,680
- You know the Lieutenant?
- No.

116
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,040
Monahseetah likes his horse.

117
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,600
He's Lt. Rob Dancy,
just been transferred to my command.

118
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
- About that scouting job...
- Well if you can't, you can't.

119
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
I don't want to let Beck down but...

120
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,320
Chances are we wouldn't do any
trading from June to the first snow,

121
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,200
I think we could join you
by midsummer.

122
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
Good.

123
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,600
Exactly where is the fort
going to be?

124
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,440
Say this is where we are

125
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
just west of Fort Laramie here.

126
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,840
The North Platte runs here,
Bozeman's trail is here

127
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,128
and the Powder River
branches off here...

128
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,725
- Never seen skin like this year.
- The cold winter that did it.

129
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,685
No, Beck, let it go.
He's drunk.

130
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,240
You ought not let that buck
get away with that Jim.

131
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,600
- Now he thinks you're scared.
- Let him think.

132
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,491
Now is no time to start a fight.

133
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,187
All battened down Jim.

134
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,240
It's good you showed no anger,
Tachahngpe.

135
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,027
Sit down.

136
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,360
Not one of our chiefs
signed the treaty.

137
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,560
Yet the fort has been built
and my young men are angry.

138
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,160
I know but for the sake of your people
you must keep them from war.

139
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,200
Today there are a hundred soldiers,
tomorrow there'll be thousands.

140
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,680
You can't hold back a flood.

141
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,200
But if something happens,
if blood is shed on the road,

142
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,363
I may have to go to war.

143
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,280
I see what lies ahead.

144
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,360
I would teach my people to change
from the ways we have lived

145
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
and to learn the ways
of the white man,

146
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,760
if the white man would
only give us time.

147
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,968
They push us too fast.

148
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,640
What is it Corporal?

149
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,120
I been telling him there's nothing
from here to Virginia City

150
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,880
except the fort and Indians.

151
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,000
He should wait until more
wagons come along.

152
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,920
You didn't say how long
that might be?

153
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,520
Caravan might roll up tomorrow
or a month from tomorrow.

154
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,280
Can't we have cavalry escort now?

155
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,680
There's only one cavalry troop
at Fort Phil Kearney.

156
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,200
We haven't got the men to escort
every contraption that comes along.

157
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,760
The rule is no escort
for less than five wagons.

158
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,040
Every day I'm not in Virginia City
it's costing me 500 dollars.

159
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,080
If you are riding into the fort
why can't we come along with you.

160
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,280
We're the mail detail.

161
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,800
This wagon can't do 30 miles a day
and we have to ride fast.

162
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,960
You could likely
get through all right alone

163
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,800
if you're a good shot.

164
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,000
You better take the long way round...
Go back to Laramie, cut due north.

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,480
- That would take a month longer.
- Well as he said, we're in a hurry.

166
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,880
Sergeant, who's commanding
this detail?

167
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,280
I decide how fast we travel.

168
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,360
We can escort you as far
as Fort Kearney.

169
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,280
Why that's...

170
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,680
That's acting like
a perfect gentleman.

171
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,840
Cavalry men are well known
for their gallantry.

172
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,240
We'll return the favor
by giving a free show at the fort.

173
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,427
The Colonel will be glad
for the diversion Ma'am.

174
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
If you're ready?

175
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,387
We're ready.

176
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,080
Think we'll get to the fort soon?

177
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,960
I'm in no hurry. Are you?

178
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,040
No, but Uncle Dan thinks that
gold in Virginia City

179
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,600
is melting away like butter.

180
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,160
It's not just that.
I have to keep moving.

181
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,915
I got iron in my blood.
If I sit still I rust.

182
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,480
Somebody's messing
with the horses.

183
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,267
Come on.

184
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,857
Don't shoot Lieutenant.

185
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,992
You shouldn't have done that.
You know the Colonel's orders.

186
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,667
Just a kid.

187
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,163
Just a scrawny little kid.

188
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,120
If anyone asks Sergeant
it was a fox.

189
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,480
A fox was scaring the horses.

190
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,280
I shot and I missed.

191
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,977
Now let's get him out of sight.

192
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,963
Get your ropes!

193
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,283
I'll take the lines.

194
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,440
Dan and I would have just sat here.
We wouldn't have known what to do.

195
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,240
Tricks of the trade.

196
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,120
How long have you been in the army?

197
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,000
Seven years off and on.

198
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
I was wounded in '63
and got a medical discharge.

199
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,200
I joined up again last year.

200
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,022
And got shipped out to
this howling wilderness.

201
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,400
I asked for this assignment.

202
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,720
I got a taste for Indian fighting
while I was out of the army.

203
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,080
How?

204
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,200
Ever hear of Chivington?

205
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,480
No.

206
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,760
He was a preacher who had
a volunteer Indian fighting outfit.

207
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,440
I served with him for
two solid years.

208
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,137
We really cleaned up
that part of the country.

209
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,480
Chivington was quite a man.

210
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,320
We had a high time.

211
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,278
All ready Lieutenant.

212
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,994
Giddy up!

213
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Hold it!

214
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,793
Lieutenant.

215
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,427
What do you make of that?

216
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,720
Indian sign of some sort.

217
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,440
Warning do you think?

218
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,762
We're too near the fort.

219
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,650
Looks like there's gonna
be a little trouble.

220
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,360
Julie, it's awful nice of that
young lieutenant to escort us.

221
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,400
- You mean Rob?
- So it's Rob now, is it?

222
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,121
- The lieutenant's crowding you.
- He thinks he is.

223
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,177
Rob!

224
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,674
Rob!

225
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,453
Stay with the wagon.
Come on, Sergeant!

226
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,848
They never went down there.

227
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
Where'd those Sioux go?

228
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,240
I didn't see anybody.

229
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,360
How about you Beck?

230
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,480
You must have seen them.
They made off behind those rocks.

231
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,240
Gully on the other side?

232
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,680
Sheer cliff. They couldn't
have gone down there.

233
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,200
The Sioux are good horsemen.
They can ride where you couldn't

234
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,320
or I couldn't.

235
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,857
Is she Sioux?

236
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,153
No. She's Cheyenne.

237
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,762
Sure don't know
your Indians, do you?

238
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,752
Let's get back to the wagon.

239
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,992
We'll push on.
There's a doctor at the Fort.

240
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,760
Take it easy with that wagon.

241
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,173
That's a fool thing to do.

242
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,600
Likely kill that old man to
bounce around with an arrow in him.

243
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,680
Rob, maybe he's right.

244
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,320
- There's nothing we can do.
- You can take that arrow out.

245
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,847
That's a job for a doctor.

246
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,002
Go on. I'll ride behind.

247
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,837
We can manage from here.

248
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,560
The Colonel hired us as scouts.
We'll ride along with you.

249
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,280
Is the Colonel expecting her?

250
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,240
I think so. She was with us
when we were hired.

251
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,860
I doubt it'll go down with the men
to have an Indian in the Fort.

252
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,920
That Sioux arrow should
have got him.

253
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,480
No, I wouldn't want any Indian
to kill that pretty soldier boy.

254
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,720
Oh, he's the one.

255
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,400
He's the guy Monahseetah
spotted in Laramie.

256
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,400
He looks so young. She was
just a kid when this happened.

257
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,720
- She could be wrong.
- I know that.

258
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,800
That's why I'll wait
until I'm sure.

259
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,680
After all these years,
you still trying to track him down?

260
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,000
Wouldn't you be?

261
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,787
Come on. Let's beat it.

262
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,920
Mail detail approaching.

263
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,520
Open the gates.

264
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,432
Mail detail approaching.

265
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,680
Jim!

266
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,080
- Jim! I'd about given up on you.
- Hello Colonel.

267
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,240
Major, you know Jim Bridger.

268
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,858
Is that Jim Bridger?

269
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,480
My mean have done
a good job here Jim,

270
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,074
and a fast one.

271
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,065
- What do you think of it?
- It's well placed Colonel.

272
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,967
We built this fort in 34 days.

273
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,763
Hurry up with the mail Parr.

274
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,520
We had a brush with the Indians.
A man in the wagon was wounded.

275
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,920
- How many Indian casualties?
- None. They all got away.

276
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,320
I want a full report.
Go to my office. You too Sergeant.

277
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,120
Parr, Lt. Brown will help you
sort the mail and distribute it.

278
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,400
- Yes sir.
- Major, take care of the wounded man.

279
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,994
Right sir.

280
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,920
There's not much I can do Miss.

281
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,232
- Doctor, please.
- I won't risk an operation.

282
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,840
If the doctor's brain was put
in a jaybird, he'd fly backward.

283
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,640
- Say, you THE Jim Bridger?
- That's right.

284
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,400
What's that Indian name I heard?
"Techa" something?

285
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,440
- Techahngpe.
- "The chump"?

286
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,000
No, "Techahngpe". That's
Sioux for Tomahawk.

287
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,360
You must've been in this country
quite a while I reckon.

288
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,760
- I've been out here a while.
- Yeah, Jim says that

289
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,084
when he first came west them hills
was nothing but holes in the ground.

290
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,400
The Adjutant said you men can bunk
in the Quartermaster Barracks.

291
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,565
He couldn't figure what
to do about the squaw.

292
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,320
We'll wait here until
he can figure.

293
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,800
She can't sleep in the barracks
and the wives in the fort...

294
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,160
Mr. Bridger?

295
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,267
The Colonel says you should
report to the office.

296
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,315
They kept hidden until
we were nearly past.

297
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,400
They made a fast attack and ran.
There was no provocation.

298
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,640
I left Red Cloud's village
four days ago.

299
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,000
He said they wouldn't fight
unless they were pushed.

300
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,640
And an Indian's word
is Gospel?

301
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,960
In fact Indians don't lie.
It's part of their religion.

302
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,560
Lieutenant, were you with that
wagon all the way from Laramie?

303
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,640
All the way from the outpost.

304
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,640
- And nothing happened?
- To the wagon? No sir.

305
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,462
And no other incident
was reported to us.

306
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,960
- And you Sergeant, hear anything?
- Not a thing.

307
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,667
What about it Jim?

308
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,290
Let the Lieutenant have it his way.
They attack out of pure cussedness.

309
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,680
Let's have it now.
Let's have the whole story.

310
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,840
Don't lie. I can read your face
as plane as that buffalo skull.

311
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,040
Those Indians had a reason
for making that attack.

312
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,880
Something happened on the road,
something Dancy didn't tell.

313
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,480
I got to serve under Lt. Dancy.
If I make him out a liar...

314
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,400
The Colonel will nail your hide
unless you spit it out now.

315
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,994
Let's have it.

316
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,077
Dancy killed a Sioux.

317
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,600
One of the horses whinnied and
we went to have a look see.

318
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,440
Two Indian kids were trying
to steal the horses.

319
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,640
Dancy went and shot one.

320
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,803
I told him he hadn't ought to.

321
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,045
It was just two puny,
scared, little kids.

322
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,122
What are you telling the Colonel?

323
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,176
Nothing.

324
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,680
Lights been flashing out there
all last night.

325
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,440
Never seen them before.
Now smoke signals.

326
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,200
The Sioux are having a conversation.
They're calling in the hunters.

327
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,567
Maybe you'll get an invitation.

328
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,680
Misery loves company?

329
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,280
Or maybe you'd rather be alone?

330
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,320
No, you're very welcome company.

331
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,371
What's your misery? The old fellow?
How you call him? Dan?

332
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,800
I imagine he'll be all right.
He'll pull through.

333
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,480
The doctor says Dan's going to die.

334
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,800
He won't operate. He says the
arrow is too close to his heart.

335
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,640
That doctor...

336
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,000
- He could be wrong.
- You said you could take it out.

337
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,760
I had before. I said he shouldn't
be left the way he is now.

338
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,480
Would you?

339
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,240
Do you think the old fellow
is game?

340
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,554
- I can't promise anything.
- But you'll try.

341
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,856
I'll try.

342
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,080
I won't be responsible.

343
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,913
Dan's willing.

344
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,727
As long as I can't stop you.

345
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,600
Drink as much of this as you can.

346
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,627
I never turn down a free one.

347
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,925
When we get this over with
I'll have one with you.

348
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,753
Hold on Dan.

349
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,440
That's it.

350
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,360
Nothing to do now but wait until
the shock wears off.

351
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,091
Don't worry. He's tough.
He'll make it.

352
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,274
Hold it!

353
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,960
- Williams, James!
- Here.

354
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,640
- William, John...
- Morning assembly.

355
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,952
Come on, maybe we can get
some coffee in the mess hall.

356
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,040
You're a strange man.
The things you know!

357
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,200
Like what you did for Dan.
You were better than any doctor.

358
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,880
You don't have to live wild
like you do.

359
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,760
You could be a big man.

360
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,480
I have my idea of bigness.

361
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Then why do I somehow
feel sorry for you?

362
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,360
You shouldn't. I live
the way I like to live.

363
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,720
But you miss so much.

364
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,240
For every way of living
something has to be given up.

365
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,243
What do you give up?

366
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,857
Crazy notions like...

367
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,360
- Miss.
- Yes?

368
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,120
There's something you could do
that I'd take as a favor?

369
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,600
Yes?

370
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,360
It's for Monahseetah.
She's just a kid and she's scared.

371
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,320
I'll be away scouting.
Would you look after her for me?

372
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,800
Well, Dan and I are leaving
as soon as he's able.

373
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,000
That'll be weeks.

374
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,400
- But don't you see...
- Yes. I think I do.

375
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,475
I'm sorry Miss Madden.

376
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,360
Wait.

377
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,680
Has he been bothering you?

378
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,683
No, not really.

379
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,080
They say he cut
the arrow out of Dan.

380
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,640
He saved Dan's life.

381
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,000
If he lives he can thank
his own toughness, not Bridger.

382
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,560
Has that sqaw man been asking
any questions about me?

383
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,080
No. Why should he?
What do you mean, sqaw man?

384
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,016
Why a man who marries a sqaw.

385
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Is she...

386
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
Is she his wife?

387
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,320
I doubt if any preacher
mumbled over them.

388
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,360
The Colonel is worse than innocent
to bring him here to the fort.

389
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,640
Bridger is a spy for Red Cloud.

390
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,680
- No.
- He saw where the Sioux went.

391
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,200
He lied to save their skins.

392
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,080
Any trouble we have with Indians
from here on out

393
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,655
I'll bet a month's pay can
be traced right back to Bridger.

394
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,237
Jim, over here.

395
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,040
- Jim.
- Colonel.

396
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,240
Someday I'll get it through
my head you always get back.

397
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,200
- Beck get in alright?
- Rode in three days ago.

398
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,280
He scouted as far south
as Red Fork.

399
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,840
I'll finish with Dan here
and I'll be right with you.

400
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
- How do you feel Dan?
- Fit as a fiddle.

401
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,763
- Alright?
- Fine.

402
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,320
Dan, the show would be good
for the men. It'd cheer them up

403
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,080
and make them forget their worries
at least for an hour.

404
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,840
That's if you make it
good and lively.

405
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,920
We'll do our best, of course
I can't do my juggling yet

406
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,200
but I'll figure out something
else to do

407
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,640
and Julie's singing here will
liven things up plenty.

408
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm sure it will.
Is that alright with you Miss?

409
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,360
- Oh yes. That'll be fine.
- Good.

410
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,320
I'll tell them at assembly.

411
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,480
- Jim, you cover a lot of country?
- I got as far as Montana.

412
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,840
A lot of them, an awful lot,
camped along the Big Horn.

413
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,040
Winter is months off and they're
already storing away meat.

414
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,080
Those young braves seem to be
getting kind of impatient.

415
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,960
It doesn't look very good.

416
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,440
Dancy claims you load
the reports to scare us.

417
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,080
What do you think?

418
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,880
You can't make me think it's
any worse than I know it is.

419
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,840
Every day there's another incident.

420
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,680
While you were gone
we lost three more troopers.

421
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,560
Trail wagon escort.

422
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
They sending reinforcements
up from Laramie?

423
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,600
They haven't answered. They did
close the road to settlers.

424
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,280
- That's good.
- Last week I sent another request.

425
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,800
If they can't send men I asked
for ammunition and rifles.

426
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,758
Mail detail's due now.

427
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,074
Hold it!

428
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,536
Halt!

429
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,307
Open up! It's Hanna.

430
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,840
- Where's the Colonel?
- In his quarters.

431
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,760
The other men sacrificed themselves
so Hanna could bring us the mail.

432
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,160
Including the latest answer
from Commissioner Davis.

433
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,368
"Our informants"...

434
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,760
"have convinced us that you
exaggerate your situation.

435
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,640
Additional forces are
unnecessary at Fort Kearney.

436
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,520
However we have dispatched some
of the equipment you requested.

437
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,680
Signed: Russel E. Davis
Commissioner for Indian Affairs."

438
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,240
Three men died to bring me that.

439
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,000
- At least we're getting equipment.
- Let's hope it's rifles and powder.

440
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,520
It could be a new mowing machine
for the parade ground lawn.

441
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,040
I'd like to speak my piece again.

442
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,320
Davis is right.
We don't need reinforcements

443
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,320
considering the caliber of our men.
They're all seasoned veterans.

444
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,440
One Cavalry troop, a handful
against 4000 Sioux.

445
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,920
The only answer to these Indian
outrages is an immediate campaign.

446
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,040
I agree with Capt. Fetterman sir.

447
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,800
Send out every man we can spare,
surprise the Sioux in his camp...

448
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,320
What's so funny?

449
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,000
I imagine he's laughing at the idea
of surprising the Sioux camp.

450
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,360
That camp stretches more than
20 miles along the Big Horn River.

451
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,400
We've only your word for that.

452
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,640
Your own experience should tell you
that I'm right Lieutenant.

453
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,880
You've done a little
Indian fighting, haven't you?

454
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,640
Weren't you in that
Colorado campaign in '64?

455
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,771
In 1864 I was in
a Military Hospital in Washington.

456
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,560
- Let's have your advice Jim?
- I don't know.

457
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,960
Prayer and those chuckleheads
like Davis find out this fort

458
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
has no business being here and
maybe you'll be ordered out in time.

459
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,240
Shouldn't somebody ride down
and hurry that equipment?

460
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,800
If it is on the road.

461
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,920
Otherwise they'll take their
own sweet time.

462
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,120
- Jim?
- I'll go if you want me to.

463
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,040
And pay your friend Red Cloud
a visit?

464
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
Gentlemen!

465
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,480
It was my idea Lieutenant.

466
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,360
Jim's friendly with the Indians.
He's sure to get through.

467
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,680
- Maybe I ought to go instead.
- You seem anxious to volunteer.

468
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,040
Meaning I might pay a visit
to Red Cloud?

469
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,600
Could be.

470
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,800
But that's a gamble.

471
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,760
Less of a gamble to send a soldier
down the road.

472
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,680
But that's up to you Colonel.

473
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,481
I'll take a chance on you Beckworth.
I'll come back to it later.

474
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,960
Dan, you think you're
fit enough to travel?

475
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,680
I am but the Colonel won't let
us leave before it's safe.

476
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,760
I'm sick of this fort.

477
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,960
The Lieutenant getting
hard to handle?

478
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,120
- Rob Dancy?
- Or is that Jim Bridger?

479
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,520
You don't think I'm so blind
I don't know what ails you?

480
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,720
- What ails me?
- The way you've been banging around.

481
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,320
There's no special reason.

482
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,600
Yes there is honey.
A man's got you surrounded.

483
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,720
Only he's a man who can't be
harnessed to your kind of life,

484
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,920
who won't go near
the big, bright cities.

485
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
That isn't what's wrong Dan.

486
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,560
Even if it breaks your heart I'd
rather Bridger than that Lieutenant.

487
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,563
That isn't what ails me.

488
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,520
Only I never could say
I'm sorry.

489
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,640
How does a girl go about
saying she's sorry!

490
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,521
If she's really sorry,
it'll get said.

491
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,000
I'm going out for a while.

492
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,440
- Out where?
- Riding.

493
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,092
They won't let you ride
outside the fort.

494
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,707
Monahseetah.

495
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,913
Come here dear.

496
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,800
I want you to go the Commissary.

497
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,320
Bring this food from the store.

498
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,760
Do you understand?

499
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,800
Yes.

500
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,120
Bring food from store.

501
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,793
That's right.

502
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,200
I'd never have the patience
to teach her English.

503
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,320
And I'd never feel safe.

504
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,080
I bless the Christian impulse
I had to take her in to my home.

505
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,320
She's really a very sweet girl.

506
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,080
I only wish someone could adopt her
and see to her schooling.

507
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,480
But isn't she that
Mr. Bridger's squaw?

508
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,680
Or... wife I guess I should say.

509
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,797
Rubbish, she's no such thing.

510
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,535
- You ain't aiming to ride outside?
- No, just around the parade ground.

511
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,080
Shouldn't you wait until night?

512
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,480
Dark don't mean nothing to Sioux.
Even the kids are half bloodhound.

513
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,360
Besides I can make 20 miles by night.

514
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,720
If they sent those breech loaders,
every hour counts.

515
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,000
- Goodbye Colonel.
- Goodbye.

516
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,800
- Beck.
- What?

517
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,640
If you're not back tomorrow
I'll be out looking for you.

518
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,920
You know Jim, I haven't
looked at a calendar in months,

519
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,391
but I got a feeling
tomorrow'll be an awful day.

520
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,720
Jim,

521
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,520
what is it between you
and Lt. Dancy?

522
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,320
You went after him like a mink
going after a chicken.

523
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,200
I can't say that I care for him.

524
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,040
I think it goes deeper than that.

525
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,990
You were gonna turn down the job
until you saw Dancy.

526
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,160
Alright Jim, I won't press you.

527
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,520
It's your business as long as
there's no trouble on the post

528
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,680
but there are a few questions
I don't dare let die.

529
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,160
In the case of a showdown,
which side are you on?

530
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,080
You mean yours or Red Cloud's?

531
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,200
I mean your country's
or it's enemy's?

532
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,480
This is Red Cloud's country
and yours and mine.

533
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,360
It takes facts to make a word
like enemy real.

534
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,320
- Too late to argue that.
- Too late for you, but not for me.

535
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,600
I've tried to do the job
you hired me to do and...

536
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:12,324
I'm a fight. If it comes,
you can't be on both sides.

537
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,602
I'll cross that bridge
when I have to.

538
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,360
I'll promise you one thing though

539
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,960
when I decide you'll
be the first to know.

540
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,125
Present sabers!

541
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,280
Let's go after them sir.
We're all saddled up.

542
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,960
Don't be a fool. That's what
they want. It's an ambush.

543
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,080
Open up!

544
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,120
Don't open that gate.
Nobody's to leave the fort.

545
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,998
Get that man to the hospital.

546
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,051
Alright. Detail dismissed!

547
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,560
Open up!

548
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,160
- Nobody is to leave the post.
- Open up. I'm not in this army.

549
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,402
- But the Colonel's orders...
- Get that gate open!

550
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,767
Get off! Get off and hurry up!

551
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,120
Let's hope they track that horse
and not us.

552
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,977
Come on, get down in here
and keep quiet.

553
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,560
If we shake those Sioux
we can start hiking.

554
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,031
If we're lucky enough
to shake them.

555
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,517
We'll wait here a while.

556
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,160
- I'm very grateful to you for...
- Forget it.

557
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,320
I owe you a lot. You saved Dan
and mine.

558
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,040
I said forget it.

559
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,520
Don't you know this is no country
to go pleasure riding in?

560
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,320
This isn't like your big cities.
A lot of trouble because of you.

561
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,720
Because I had to kill
that young brave.

562
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,920
Not knowing what side you're on
must make things complicated.

563
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,640
In fact it does.

564
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,880
Anyway it's Monahseetah
that saved your life.

565
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,440
She saw you riding out like a fool

566
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,651
and saw the war party riding
the same way and told me.

567
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,817
Then please thank your wife for me.

568
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
My what?

569
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,080
Your wife. What do you call her?
Monahseetah.

570
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,117
She's not my wife.

571
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,720
- But I was told that she...
- You talk to the wrong people.

572
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,066
There's some at the fort that
could have told you different.

573
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,840
I imagine the people you talk to
call me a sqaw man, don't they?

574
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,080
- Yes.
- I am a sqaw man.

575
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,197
My wife is dead.

576
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,400
I'll tell you a story to help
you pass the time.

577
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,560
There was a Cheyenne Chief,
Black Kettle, a great chief.

578
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,920
A few years back he signed a treaty
with the American government.

579
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,200
He put an American flag on his tipi
to show he meant to keep it

580
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,897
and the US government kept it.

581
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:45,475
Then four years ago,
a bunch of drifting, no good scum

582
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,520
god up what they called
the Colorado volunteers.

583
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,000
They were very brave,
big heroes.

584
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,480
They were gonna make the West
safe for the white man.

585
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,840
Their leader was a sanctimonious,
blood-thirsty, so-called preacher

586
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,492
named Chivington.

587
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,720
I've heard of him somewhere.

588
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,320
The only good thing you could
have heard is that he's dead.

589
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,840
Well this...

590
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,520
Chivington and his volunteers

591
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,400
rode out to Black Kettle's village
early one morning,

592
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,680
and had themselves a little fun.

593
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,360
More than 200 of them charged down
on a sleeping Indian village.

594
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,000
They rousted the people out and then

595
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,280
they shot and hacked and killed
until they'd had enough fun.

596
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,960
Men, women, old people

597
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,633
and kids.

598
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,880
Monahseetah was Black Kettle's
youngest daughter.

599
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,160
She saw her mother and father shot,

600
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,826
her sister cut down with a saber
along with a baby she was holding.

601
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,656
Her sister's name was Nantah,

602
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,048
and Nantah was my wife.

603
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,400
And the...

604
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,722
The baby was my son.

605
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,288
I was away trapping.

606
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,577
When I came home I buried them

607
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,964
and then I started hunting
the butcher who did it.

608
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,267
I'm sorry.

609
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,200
You're sorry the way you'd be

610
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:42,280
if I told you my pet dog was killed,
for me but not for her.

611
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,397
She was only an Indian.

612
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,280
Come on.

613
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,238
Let's start hiking.

614
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,091
It's Bridger and Miss Madden.

615
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,800
Miss Madden's horse
came back hours ago.

616
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,120
Then those drums started up.

617
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,840
The Colonel was going to send out
a scouting party at daybreak.

618
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,120
Maybe there's no use in my saying so

619
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,920
but I'm not like you think I am.

620
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,760
Don't bother yourself over
what I think.

621
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,845
You're as blind in your way
as the others are in theirs.

622
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,897
Julie!

623
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,560
Julie, we were heartsick.

624
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,520
I was worried about you Jim.
What about those drums?

625
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,640
That Sioux war party caught up
with Miss Madden.

626
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,720
I tried to get her without a fight
but I had to kill one of them.

627
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:47,228
I killed Lone Elk.
He was Red Cloud's favorite son.

628
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,400
My leave starts in ten days

629
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,680
so I might ride with you to
Virginia City.

630
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,680
Looks more like you'll spend
your leave here in the fort.

631
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,680
We'll have our show down with
Red Cloud before the week's out.

632
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,360
It'll be over as soon as it starts,
now that Bridger lit the fuse.

633
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,240
The Colonel is not happy
about it.

634
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:24,000
Carrington's been ducking a fight
ever since we got out here.

635
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,155
He's a good officer but too
squeamish for an Indian campaign.

636
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,000
They're asking for it.

637
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,640
He's up against the Indians.
He's too old to learn new tricks.

638
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,132
Like you learned
from Chivington?

639
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,080
I thought all my chatter had gone
in one of your lovely ears and

640
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,400
right out the other.

641
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,073
Julie,

642
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,880
- what's the matter?
- I'm tired.

643
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,840
- I'll see you to the wagon.
- No, don't!

644
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,838
Don't you touch me.

645
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,440
I'm sorry.

646
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,807
You better go to bed.

647
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,400
You took an awful sudden fancy
for sewing Julie?

648
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,880
It keeps me from hearing
those drums.

649
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,360
How long have they been going now?

650
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,000
About four days I reckon.

651
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,240
- It didn't get said, did it?
- What?

652
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,347
You asked me how a girl says
she's sorry.

653
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,723
No, it didn't get said.

654
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,817
And now there's something else
I can't say.

655
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,867
You want to tell me?

656
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,056
I know what you'd tell me
because you're a man.

657
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,240
But this is something
that might cause a killing.

658
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,097
Well, then talk to a woman.

659
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,400
- Where are you going?
- To fetch firewood from the pinery.

660
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,000
I thought nobody was supposed
to go outside the fort.

661
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,391
We got to have firewood.
We got to cook.

662
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,280
Martha.

663
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,896
Mar...

664
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,387
Monahseetah...

665
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,200
I wish I could tell you.

666
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,022
I wish you could understand.

667
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,760
Listen, do you know "thank you"?

668
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,080
Jim, your Jim, told me

669
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,117
and I thank you.

670
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,274
Please.

671
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,656
Thank you.

672
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,760
- It's lovely to hear you laughing.
- You're so pretty Monahseetah!

673
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,520
I wish the pin was prettier.

674
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,960
I didn't know Monahseetah
was learning English.

675
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,000
She's learning wonderfully fast.

676
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,800
Did you ever notice trouble
seems to make us women

677
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,760
forget differences?

678
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,276
With men it seems to turn them
into snapping dogs.

679
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,497
I haven't seen my wife in a year.

680
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:09,240
It'll be doomsday before
any of us see our folks.

681
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,240
What's the Colonel waiting for?

682
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,840
Bridger claims we haven't
got a chance outside the fort.

683
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,280
He wants us penned up here where
Red Cloud can push us over.

684
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,137
I wish they'd attack!
I want to see some action.

685
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,200
Anything new from our
Indian friends Mr. Bridger?

686
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,840
Nope. Nothing new.

687
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,880
When you don't see Indians,
that's when you have to watch out.

688
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,440
There's a lot of truth
to that old saying.

689
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,286
I say you have to watch out more
when they got spies sneaking around.

690
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,680
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That you shouldn't snoop around.

691
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,120
And your friend Beckworth.

692
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,040
Funny how the drums began
the day he left.

693
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,282
And he ain't been heard of since.

694
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,800
Listen! They've stopped!

695
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,337
What does that mean?

696
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,280
Rifle fire.

697
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,807
That wood detail's in trouble.

698
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,560
May I go? It may be my last chance
for action before my leave.

699
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,400
- Go ahead.
- This may be a trap.

700
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,920
They should go and come straight
back, and not over that ridge.

701
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,760
Nobody over that ridge Captain,
that's an order.

702
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,763
Yes sir.

703
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,880
Jim,

704
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,360
I have to tell you something.
You have a right to know.

705
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,880
It's no proof but when you
told me about Chivington,

706
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,560
I knew I'd heard his name before.

707
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,520
Later I remembered.

708
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:13,400
Traveling from Laramie, Dancy said
he'd served in his volunteers.

709
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,892
You sorry now you warned them?

710
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,379
No, there are other men out there
besides Dancy.

711
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,172
Looks like Hanna bringing
the good news.

712
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,560
We figured the Colonel was
sending help.

713
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,280
We held off about ten charges then
they sort of skedaddled up the hill.

714
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,400
- How many?
- About 20.

715
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,097
We got two of them and not
one of us was even nicked.

716
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,320
Look Captain.

717
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,760
Let's take a crack
at those up there.

718
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,680
I want to get one scalp

719
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,513
Sitting ducks Captain.

720
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,000
You've been in the Army long
enough to follow orders.

721
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,280
Wait Captain.

722
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,480
If we take care of them Carrington
couldn't bring charges against us.

723
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,240
The way they feel in Laramie
we'd get a promotion.

724
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,800
It's the oldest rule in the Army.

725
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,080
Don't disobey orders
when you can't win,

726
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,777
But when you can't lose!

727
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,107
Bridger!

728
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,800
I'd have bet my life on Fetterman.

729
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,497
I wouldn't have bet mine
on Dancy.

730
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,163
Sitting ducks.

731
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,880
Draw!

732
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,417
Swords!

733
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,474
Charge!

734
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,667
Jim! Jim!

735
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,540
- Laramie didn't send equipment.
- Three wagons full.

736
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,951
They sent
the breech loading rifles too.

737
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,791
Now?
Now they send the ammunition.

738
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,796
Well their wagons will be
useful to carry back our dead.

739
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,403
Get a stretcher.

740
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,920
Colonel sir...

741
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,880
Son, why did Fetterman
countermand my order?

742
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,146
- Is the Captain dead?
- Everyone but you.

743
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,680
It was Lt. Dancy sir.

744
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,480
He ragged the Captain.
He wouldn't take no.

745
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,893
He said they'd get promoted.

746
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,480
Dancy got away.

747
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,880
He threw away five men to give
himself that one chance.

748
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,560
Which way? Which way?

749
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,643
Up through those hills.

750
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:41,317
Chivington said I should
kill that sqaw.

751
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,728
I had to follow orders.

752
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,760
Afterwards...

753
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:52,320
He told me she was
the one you married.

754
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:56,552
Get up! Get up!

755
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,600
- What happened to Dancy?
- A kid got him.

756
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,433
A little Indian kid.

757
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,760
- Only one?
- There'll be more.

758
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,433
You better get ready.

759
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:50,484
Keep the ammunition wagons here
and the others back to the fort.

760
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,440
Sergeant. Dismount!

761
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,480
Distribute the rifles,
behind the wagons.

762
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,941
Yes sir. Dismount men!
Get those rifles!

763
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,800
- What are they singing?
- Death chant.

764
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,987
They always sing that just before
they start a ruckus.

765
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,200
- What are they waiting for Jim?
- Red Cloud.

766
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,442
Waiting for him to give the orders.

767
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,200
It's a pity. These
new breechloaders will wipe him out

768
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,280
- he hasn't got a chance.
- What do you think he'll do?

769
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,033
How will he attack?

770
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,120
Probably come at you in waves.

771
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,360
He'll try to draw a volley
with the first and keep hitting you,

772
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,960
before you get a chance to reload.

773
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:44,600
He doesn't know with these breech
loaders reload three times as fast.

774
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,240
Thanks Jim.

775
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:50,631
At my command fire by volley and
reload as fast as possible.

776
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,427
It's Red Cloud.

777
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:21,760
That means back to earth.
They'll fight till they die.

778
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,376
Get ready.

779
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,337
Fire!

780
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,194
Fire!

781
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,817
Fire!

782
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,017
Fire!

783
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,176
Fire!

784
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,280
Well, it's finished.

785
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,751
Red Cloud's coming down
to pick up his dead.

786
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,160
You had him in your sights.

787
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,833
I know.

788
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,840
Red Cloud is a great man.

789
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,244
We'll need great men on both sides
when this ruckus is over.

790
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,440
It's a mixed up business.

791
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,640
Red Clod wins his in Washington
after we beat him on the field.

792
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,560
We didn't beat him.
It was those breechloaders.

793
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,320
- It was a mechanical thing.
- But he is getting a new treaty.

794
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,640
We're closing the road
and giving up the fort.

795
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:49,680
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this treaty will be kept.

796
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,880
For the sake of the Sioux Nation
I hope so.

797
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:58,880
Victory for the Sioux and
their great leader, Red Cloud.

798
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,760
The year, 1868.

799
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,920
Fort Kearney is abandoned

800
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,840
and the US government
signs a peace treaty.

801
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,200
The offiicial document reads:

802
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:16,160
"From this day forward all war
between the parties

803
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,640
shall forever cease.

804
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,720
The white man is leaving
and the red man is left with

805
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,800
a bitter memory of dead
and wounded.

806
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:29,840
So now he moves to destroy
that memory,

807
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:35,560
to destroy the last
remaining symbol of another world.

808
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:39,960
There will be dances,
feasting and singing.

809
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,360
The sacred hunting ground
has not yielded to the plow.

810
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:51,480
For another 30 years the sun will
rise on the world of the Sioux

811
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:55,040
the world of Red Cloud
and Sitting Bull,

812
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:01,149
the world of Jim Bridger,
pioneer, hunter, scout, American."
