1
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,038
That's your man.

2
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,193
- Draw your pay.
- You wanted him broken.

3
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,749
Yeah, but not ruined.

4
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,036
Now, get out of here.

5
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,430
Mr. Marshall.

6
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,551
Ever heard of a J.W. Grant?

7
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,234
He needs you. Urgent.

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,071
My husband.

9
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,158
Hurry. Hurry.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,594
Please, hurry.

11
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,355
Get out of here.

12
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,718
Baby!

13
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,478
It's nice to see you.

14
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,875
I'm Joe Grant.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Ehrengard.

15
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,109
Got your telegram, Mr. Grant.

16
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,669
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sharp.

17
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,429
Yeah. Me too, Lizzie.

18
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,036
Mr. Grant, I'm your local
bank representative.

19
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,714
As per your instructions,
this box contains...

20
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,673
Thank you for coming, Mr. Fardan.

21
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,115
The receipt, Mr. Grant.

22
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,919
Exactly $100,000 in gold coins.

23
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,993
Not a coin larger than $50.
That's quite an unusual request.

24
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,357
Thank you. Move out.

25
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,591
Mr. Grant. Slow freight ahead.

26
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,752
- Sidetrack it.
- You should count the money.

27
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,469
- Didn't you count it?
- Well, yes, of course, but...

28
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,952
Thank you.

29
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,756
Henry "Rico" Fardan. Virginia Military
Academy, Philippine campaign...

30
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,957
...Cuba with Roosevelt's Rough Riders.
Married a Mexican woman.

31
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,917
No children. Wife deceased.

32
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,914
Joined Pancho Villa as weapons expert
and tactician.

33
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,835
Your hair was darker then.

34
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,357
My heart was lighter then.

35
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,676
Left Villa's forces, June, 1915.

36
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,196
Year of wildcatting and prospecting.
Results: Negative.

37
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,592
Now demonstrating automatic
weapons. Salary: $40 a week.

38
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,950
Hans Ehrengard. Ex-cavalryman,
cattle boss, wrangler...

39
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,190
...bull-whacker, packmaster.

40
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,278
Jacob Sharp. Specialist with rifle,
rope and longbow.

41
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,558
Most dependable scout and tracker
in the territory.

42
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,470
Any objections to working
with a Negro?

43
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,714
What's the job, Mr. Grant?

44
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,078
How well do you know him?

45
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,832
- Well enough.
- What's your feeling toward him?

46
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,275
I have the highest respect for him...

47
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,715
...as a soldier.

48
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,159
Last week, your respected soldier
kidnapped my wife.

49
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,034
His ransom note.

50
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,830
Your job:

51
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,511
A mission of mercy.

52
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,793
Raza. Captain Jesus Raza.

53
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,272
Jesus.

54
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,195
What a name for the bloodiest
cutthroat in Mexico.

55
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,239
Mrs. Grant is a prisoner
about 100 miles across the desert.

56
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,519
A hellhole. For Raza, a fortress.

57
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,750
He was born in that desert.

58
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,472
He and his men know every ravine,
every rock, every cliff.

59
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,279
It'd take a battalion at least a month.

60
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,711
But a few daring men...

61
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,872
...specialists, led by you...

62
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,919
...could do it in one bold, swift stroke.

63
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,198
Why not? You're fluent in Spanish.
You know the terrain.

64
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,749
You know Raza.
How he thinks and reacts.

65
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,755
- I know you can do it.
- I don't think so, Mr. Grant.

66
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,276
One thousand dollars a man going in.

67
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,908
If you bring her back safe and sound...

68
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,470
...another 9000 dollars
for each of you.

69
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,397
- How many men does Raza have?
- Pasqual?

70
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,199
Last month, 150, maybe. Now?

71
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,955
- Lf I were you, I'd pay the ransom.
- There it is.

72
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,831
One hundred thousand dollars
in gold coins, as requested by Raza.

73
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,198
Will that guarantee that she
won't be killed? You know Raza.

74
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,870
Say we were lucky enough to get there.
How do we get your wife out? Safely?

75
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,548
Gentlemen, I don't know
where else to turn.

76
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,950
- What we really need is an equalizer.
- Name it.

77
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,795
A dynamiter with a delicate touch
to blow out a candle...

78
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,428
...without denting the candleholder.
- Who?

79
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,912
Him.

80
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,999
Arrange to have that man at the train
where we pick up the horses.

81
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,912
- Where is he?
- Not far.

82
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,355
- Get the details.
- In jail.

83
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,992
- In jail?
- He says that $700 will bail him out.

84
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,395
But is he dependable?
Can he be trusted?

85
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,391
I trust him.

86
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,154
Then you've got him.

87
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,158
- Rico, buddy, I don't deserve you.
- I agree.

88
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,397
I can understand you getting into
a crap game and losing $700...

89
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,711
...but how'd you lose your pants?
- In a lady's bedroom.

90
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,675
Trying to raise the cash.
Almost had it made too.

91
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,709
You realize people are the only animals
who make love face to face?

92
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,555
He's all yours.

93
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,952
Thanks. Again.

94
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,155
You could have telegraphed
the money yesterday.

95
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,471
Yesterday, I didn't have the money.

96
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,390
What's the proposition?

97
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,675
You won't lose your pants.

98
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,714
Your life, maybe, but... what's that?

99
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,875
Hardly anything at all.

100
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,913
- Well?
- Nice animals.

101
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,152
- Picked by Mr. Ortega.
- You can depend on them.

102
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,156
This one is Mrs. Grant's favourite.

103
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,435
Bred for speed.

104
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,195
He'll need a lot more than that
for this job.

105
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,949
- I'm afraid you'll have to make them do.
- Mr. Grant...

106
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,636
...I can make them go,
but I can't make them do.

107
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,671
$100,000 for a wife?
She must be a lot of woman.

108
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,037
Certain women have a way
of changing some boys into men...

109
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,795
...and some men back into boys.
- That's a woman worth saving.

110
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,078
- Where are we going?
- The Painted Mountains.

111
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,191
That's right.

112
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,639
- You want us to go back to Mexico?
- This time strictly for cash.

113
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,636
- What's the deal?
- $10,000 per man, for nine days' work.

114
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,636
More money than we ever realized
out of all our schemes put together.

115
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,711
No detours!

116
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,998
I made us a contract. All the way.

117
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,996
- They know who took the woman?
- Raza.

118
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,789
Our Raza? A kidnapper?

119
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,272
- Grant's got a ransom note to prove it.
- Well, I'll be damned.

120
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,396
Most of us are.

121
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,033
Last week Mrs. Grant went riding.

122
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,759
Across the border.

123
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,431
She was born in Mexico.

124
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,996
I suppose she got lonely for it.

125
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,235
By the time we were alarmed,
the note of ransom arrived.

126
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,630
You'll want to know how she looks.

127
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,554
Those were taken four years ago
on our wedding day.

128
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,994
I guess I'm not much good without her.
Not anymore.

129
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,278
- What part of the hacienda is she kept?
- I'd only be guessing.

130
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,078
We have to know.

131
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,759
- The goat-keeper must know.
- Is he still there?

132
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,234
- What goat-keeper?
- By name, Padillia. Eduardo Padillia.

133
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,477
He was devoted to Mrs. Grant.

134
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,033
Twice a day he brought her goat's milk.
It was almost a ritual.

135
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,036
By this, he will know
you have my blessing.

136
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,278
Like myself, he would give his life
for the senora.

137
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,633
When you cross under that bridge,
you're in Mexico.

138
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,999
You'll leave as soon as it's dark.
It's safer to travel by night, rest by day.

139
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,876
Bring her back to me.

140
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,031
Please.

141
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,228
We've been following the same tracks.

142
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,277
- Mexicans.
- How many horses?

143
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,953
Eight. More likely 10.

144
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,872
- How long ago?
- Couple hours.

145
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,635
- Which way they headed?
- Same as us, south. Only, circling.

146
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,715
Now, why should they circle?

147
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,591
Raza's men?

148
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,955
- Why not?
- This far north?

149
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,037
That's a good question.

150
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,272
Could be anybody. Even friendly.

151
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,913
- Could be.
- Jake, shag them. Look them over.

152
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,674
But just look.

153
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,469
We'll camp at Dead Man's Canyon.
Spot us by the Painted Hills.

154
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,358
I'll find you.

155
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,954
Rico. You know something?

156
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,078
Me and Raza are the two
most corruptible bums.

157
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,913
- We'd do most anything for money.
- And have.

158
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,914
But not kidnapping.
That's not our trade.

159
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,356
Why did Raza pick Grant's wife
to kidnap?

160
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,279
Company. Eight.
Next bend up ahead.

161
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,910
- Last night you saw tracks for 10.
- That's right.

162
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,997
- Any cover?
- Both sides.

163
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,397
Cut out your two horses
and the dynamite mule.

164
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,432
- Maybe they're just passing.
- Lf so, they'll ride in single file.

165
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,833
The leader in front, and they'll palaver.
If it's trouble, they'll come as a group.

166
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,437
If the leader takes his hat off and
passes it across to cover his gun...

167
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,670
...let go, fast.

168
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,559
- Bill, you take the point.
- They got bolt-action rifles.

169
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,069
- Same setup as Durango?
- Yeah. Why not?

170
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,795
- They're here.
- They're here.

171
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,390
Good morning, friends.

172
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,074
Good morning.

173
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,559
They're Americans.

174
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,917
- You got lost?
- Just looking for a place to camp.

175
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,437
What you got in those packs, boss?
Gold?

176
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,993
You got more gold in your teeth.

177
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,437
He says I've got more gold
in my teeth. How funny!

178
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,911
- It's very dangerous around here.
- Oh, that so?

179
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,516
Sure. Many bandits
hide in these mountains.

180
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,558
Very bad men.
They steal from anybody.

181
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,032
- Especially gringos.
- In that case, we'd better keep moving.

182
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,599
Go with God.

183
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,151
- That makes 10.
- That's right.

184
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,673
Shoot the horse. Shoot him!

185
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,911
- Bury them deep.
- Nine more of their horses are still left.

186
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,318
- You gonna shoot them too?
- We can't spare the food and water.

187
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,869
You can turn them loose.

188
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,879
- What's so funny?
- People.

189
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,359
We just killed 10 men.
Nobody bats an eye.

190
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,513
- When it comes to a stupid animal...
- But harmless.

191
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,798
Nothing's harmless in the desert,
unless it's dead.

192
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,238
Want to face another pack
of Raza's men?

193
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,598
- They'll head south, to camp.
- They'll head to the river, north.

194
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,354
Suppose they follow us? What then?

195
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,636
Then shoot them.

196
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,798
All right. Cut them loose.

197
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,990
God almighty.

198
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,589
I've known heat before, but this is...

199
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,759
I hate the desert.

200
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,752
It's got no pity.

201
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,238
Jake.

202
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,835
- Did he take his salt?
- I'll see that he gets some.

203
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,475
Let him sleep. You too.

204
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,031
How they taking it?

205
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,197
They'll be all right.

206
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,069
You'd better scout ahead tonight.

207
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,798
Now, beyond that ridge,
20 miles of salt flats.

208
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,669
Then 10 more of sand.
220 degrees south by southwest.

209
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,798
Our next layover, Coyote Pass.

210
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,077
The cemetery of nameless men.

211
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,514
We buried some fine friends there.

212
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,715
And some fine enemies.

213
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,952
That was a fine battle.

214
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,033
Outnumbered, outgunned,
and still we held that pass.

215
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,671
Yeah, but who cares now?
Or even remembers?

216
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,070
Now, take that ruckus this morning.

217
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,792
A year ago, those men would be
fighting federals instead of gringos.

218
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,554
- We were lucky.
- We were also stiffed.

219
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,349
They had us spotted back
where we picked up their trail.

220
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,072
- Why did they sucker us into this spot?
- You're leery about the setup too. So?

221
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,279
Amigo, three days' ride from
Coyote Pass is another graveyard.

222
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,115
But instead of dead heroes,
they buried gold bullion.

223
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,273
Two million in Spanish gold.
Melted down into beautiful bars.

224
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,955
Waiting for us.
We don't have to fight Raza to get it.

225
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,835
- It's not the reason you took this job.
- Got a better reason?

226
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,278
Our word. We gave our word
to bring the woman back.

227
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,231
My word to Grant
ain't worth a plugged nickel.

228
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,394
You gave your word to me.

229
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,518
Drink?

230
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,592
Thanks.

231
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,590
Yeah, takes getting used to.

232
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,791
Broiling by day. Freezing at night.
Alkali dust choking your body.

233
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,077
Who lives here long enough
to get used to it?

234
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,710
Men, tempered like steel,
a tough breed.

235
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,269
Men who've learned how to endure.

236
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,518
- Like you and Dolworth.
- Oh, no.

237
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,716
Men like Raza.

238
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,318
I wonder how long that's been there.

239
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,396
About an hour or so.
Dolworth put it there.

240
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,475
That means everything's all clear.
An upside-down cross means danger.

241
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,076
- Could've been put there by anybody.
- That's the idea.

242
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,675
Good morning, friend.

243
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,153
- Dolworth?
- Yeah.

244
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,754
- How many more?
- Three.

245
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,589
No guns.

246
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,075
- We that close to Raza?
- Could be.

247
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,592
At least I made out with a fine pistol.

248
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,916
We sure got lucky with this gringo, eh?

249
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,709
No wonder my mother kicked me
out of the house!

250
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,634
- A bottle.
- You'd even frighten the dead!

251
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,272
Don't get carried away.

252
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,838
The bottle.

253
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,674
Where are your friends, amigo?

254
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,196
Here have a drink.
These shoes will be mine if they fit.

255
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,113
- Hey, don't I know you?
- Well, from here you look like me.

256
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,438
- Why you come to this place?
- You'll laugh.

257
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,636
It is not proper to laugh at a man
who is about to die.

258
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,598
I came because I'm crazy
about your tequila.

259
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,796
And I like your women.

260
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,431
See? You laugh.

261
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,272
What a funny guy, huh?

262
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,596
I'm gonna ask again.
Where are your friends?

263
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,593
I told you. I always travel alone.

264
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,193
It is a sacrilege to die
with a lie in your teeth.

265
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,109
See?

266
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,029
Those horses and six more
come back to us.

267
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,875
But where are the men who ride them?

268
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,753
I don't think you kill 10 men
by yourself, buddy.

269
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,354
Hold it!

270
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,519
Stop!

271
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,149
I wouldn't do that.

272
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,597
My friend would die of a terrible
headache. And so would you.

273
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,028
And so would you.

274
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,272
So wouldn't it be more sensible
if we both kept our heads, huh?

275
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,079
Put down your gun.

276
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,873
If I did that, how do I know
that you would still be friendly?

277
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,633
Do I gotta kill you
to prove I like you?

278
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,234
Your gun, mister.

279
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,637
That's why I like this fool,
because he's intelligent.

280
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,957
- Behave!
- Behave. Let it drop.

281
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,558
That's why I like this one,
because he's so intelligent.

282
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,472
Thattaboy.

283
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,076
Come on, buddy.

284
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,109
Let it go already.

285
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,591
He's a good man after all.

286
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,436
You have to get over this habit
of losing your pants.

287
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,068
- It's not dignified.
- It's drafty too.

288
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,149
- Don't worry. This time I'll do it.
- This time we need them.

289
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,035
You all right?

290
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,792
Makes you wonder
how we ever beat the Indians.

291
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,676
Thanks.

292
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,315
Interesting pass.

293
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,789
You should see it from upside down.

294
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,512
If we hightail it out of here in a hurry,
that doorway could save us hours.

295
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,670
It's the same shortcut for Raza.

296
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,276
Not if you rig it
so we slam that door in his face.

297
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,431
Yeah?

298
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,599
I'll take the first watch.

299
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,513
If it isn't hot, it's cold.
If it isn't cold, it's raining.

300
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,750
How bad is that horse?

301
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,879
- Not too good. No bottom.
- We could all do with a rest.

302
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,399
Yeah.

303
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,597
- A shave would be a relief.
- So would a bath.

304
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,916
Might as well throw in a woman.

305
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,868
Any size, any age, any colour.
Any woman.

306
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,912
Mr. D...

307
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,073
...whatever got a loving man like you
in the dynamite business?

308
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,358
I'll tell you. I was born
with a powerful passion to create.

309
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,592
I can't write, I can't paint,
I can't make up a song.

310
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,070
- So you explode things.
- That's how the world was born.

311
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,071
Biggest damn explosion ever.

312
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,313
Dynamite in the hands of a fool
means death.

313
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,670
In this case it could mean life. Ours.
If we're lucky...

314
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,276
...and get back to this rattrap,
it'll be touch-and-go.

315
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,000
All you gotta do is light this fuse.

316
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,108
You got 10 seconds to run like hell.

317
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,832
And then dynamite, not faith,
will move that mountain into this pass.

318
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,877
Peace, brother.

319
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,233
That track is the main line
to Mexico City.

320
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,275
According to this, Grant's railroad spur
branches off three miles up.

321
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,591
Beyond those hills... the hacienda.

322
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,599
Supply train.

323
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,953
- Government troops.
- Well, look here.

324
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,434
Raza.

325
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,592
Throw it!

326
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,838
Pull it!

327
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,228
- How are you, man?
- Good, chief. Thank you.

328
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,636
- Are they all Colorados?
- Yes, Captain, they all are.

329
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,752
Well, you know what to do.

330
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,955
- Justice.
- Shut up!

331
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,792
The men on that train are Colorados.
Expert marksmen.

332
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,474
Also expert at torture.

333
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,315
Years ago, they burned and looted
a town of 3000 people.

334
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,029
When they finished, 40 were left.

335
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,351
Fardan's wife was one of the lucky 40.

336
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,318
"Why are you a revolutionary?"
They asked her.

337
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,439
"To rid the world of scum like you,"
she said.

338
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,989
They stripped her naked...

339
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,233
...ran her through the cactus
until her flesh was...

340
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,189
The other 39 rebels watched her die...

341
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,710
...and did nothing.

342
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,677
Just watched.

343
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,510
What were Americans
doing in a Mexican revolution?

344
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,990
Maybe there's only one revolution,
since the beginning.

345
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,958
The good guys against the bad guys.

346
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,874
The question is:
Who are the good guys?

347
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,190
- Juanito, to the north and south, okay?
- Got it.

348
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,914
About 60 horses, four burros.

349
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,638
Two machine guns from the train.

350
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,798
Jake.

351
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,514
Keep those horses quiet.

352
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,913
Get some more from the other side.
Hurry.

353
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,069
You rode well today, Chiquita.

354
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,958
Perfectly.

355
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,316
Beautiful.

356
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,719
- That Mrs. Grant?
- That is a soldier.

357
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:56,109
Lieutenant Si Si Chiquita.
Now, there's a woman worth a ransom.

358
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,191
She never says no.

359
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,990
Before you blow a gasket,
think you can blow the water tower?

360
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,194
- How do you want it?
- Like it was hit with a French 75.

361
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,757
Mrs. Grant could be there.

362
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,716
- Seems the only likely place.
- The trouble is, we gotta be dead sure.

363
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,633
When we make our move,
there won't be time for guessing.

364
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,671
Coming through the gate.

365
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,789
- Good morning. How's the wife and kids?
- Very good, very good.

366
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,952
Wow, there's a lot of you here.

367
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,752
Anybody see any cows?

368
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,791
No.

369
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,398
It's a cinch that milk didn't
come from the breast of a tin can.

370
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,958
Our friend, the goat-keeper.

371
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,518
Good morning, sir.

372
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,477
- What is your name?
- Eduardo Padillia, at your service.

373
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,712
Do you recognize this?

374
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,358
Friends of Mr. Ortega.

375
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,318
That's right.

376
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,828
The milk that you brought
to the hacienda this morning...

377
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,955
Who was that for?

378
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,749
- Who drinks it?
- Many people.

379
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,195
Anybody special?

380
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,755
The lady. Senora. Grant.

381
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,989
She live in that room? You're sure?

382
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,119
- You have seen her?
- I know her from when she was born.

383
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,832
Her mother was dry. She was raised
on the milk of my goats.

384
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,237
- Is she well?
- Very well, considering.

385
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,437
We have come to help her.

386
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,475
Blessed be the Lord.

387
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,110
May God repay you. May God...

388
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,112
Raza has to expect one of two things:
A messenger with a ransom...

389
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,714
...or an attack from the federales.

390
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,792
We've gotta make him think
we're the Mexican army.

391
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,839
- The four of us?
- A whole battalion.

392
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,557
Now, how do the federales
start an attack? Artillery.

393
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,194
This is our battery of field guns.

394
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,432
First you hit him here. French 75s.
Then here, here, here.

395
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,716
Carefully avoiding Mrs. Grant.

396
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,237
- When they run to defend the...
- We rescue Little Red Riding Hood.

397
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,434
We can't fight our way in.
Diversion is our only chance.

398
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,752
Well?

399
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,637
Rico, buddy, I got one of my feelings.

400
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,837
Something's dicey about this.
Let's pull out.

401
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,150
If you can deliver this dynamite
with split-second timing...

402
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,390
...we can pull this job off.

403
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,756
Mr. D?

404
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,151
I guess we just gotta get lucky.

405
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,279
Jacob, this stick of dynamite
weighs exactly four ounces.

406
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,279
If you taped that to an arrow,
how far could you shoot it?

407
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,795
And hit the mark.

408
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,153
I don't like it.

409
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,515
- We get it wrong?
- Relax.

410
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,277
The stuff you're handling is safe.
These beaded sticks are trickier.

411
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,510
It's the heat.

412
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,315
Makes them sweat. Nitro.

413
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,156
When they're dry and cool,
they're safe and obedient.

414
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,232
We'll leave these sweaty ones behind.

415
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,398
Ventilate them. Cool them.
Then maybe they'll behave.

416
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,873
I don't know whether it's me or the
dynamite that's doing all that sweating.

417
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,511
Four men against so many.
How will you save the senora?

418
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,117
- I don't know yet.
- When will it happen?

419
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,429
- Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.
- Not before?

420
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,118
- There's much to prepare.
- Speak plainly, senor.

421
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,635
Am I your prisoner?

422
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,839
I want to help the senora.
But you make me feel unworthy.

423
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,911
Trouble!

424
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,512
Show us if you're worthy.
Go greet them.

425
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,435
And remember,
I speak your language.

426
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,473
They don't give good milk
if they're skinny.

427
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,031
What happened, old man?

428
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,275
Any news?

429
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,113
- Talk!
- Same as always. Very hot weather.

430
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,670
- Have you seen anyone around here?
- No.

431
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,159
A gringo maybe?

432
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,191
- Gringo?
- Yeah, a gringo.

433
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,790
Are you sure?

434
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,033
They killed and buried ten of our men.

435
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,318
They found the men
we buried in the canyon.

436
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,595
Am I worthy?

437
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,236
If I were you, Jacob, I wouldn't use
any of these for firewood.

438
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,791
Excuse me. I am ready to leave.

439
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,916
- Shall I tell the senora of your coming?
- No.

440
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,232
- She might behave differently.
- I understand.

441
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,757
By tomorrow, God willing,
the senora will be safe.

442
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,394
Until later, then.

443
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,109
So you let him go.

444
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,832
They expect him to bring the milk.

445
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,355
To hell with the milk.

446
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,749
- What must he do to prove himself?
- He proved nothing.

447
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,798
He knew if he said a wrong word,
he'd be shot.

448
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,475
What were we to do?
Watch him all night, and tomorrow?

449
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,634
When we go do the job, then what?
We take him with us? Tie him up?

450
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,032
Or were you planning killing him?
I wouldn't put that past you.

451
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,036
- I don't like it.
- All right.

452
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,760
We do the job tonight, as planned.

453
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,079
This fuse burns for 10 seconds.
Three seconds for flight of arrow?

454
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,834
- About.
- Once you light the fuse...

455
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,551
...you've got seven seconds to shoot.
- Clear.

456
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,829
Start shooting
as soon as the water tower blows.

457
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,510
These are your targets.
That's your position.

458
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,509
- I have 4: 17.
- 4:20.

459
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,753
- 4:24.
- Set them at 4:30.

460
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,157
We should have an hour before dawn.
How much time do you need?

461
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,189
I'll be ready by 5:00. This fuse
will burn for half-hour exactly.

462
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,399
- Fireworks start at 5:30 sharp.
- Any questions?

463
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,270
- Machine gun over the lady's room?
- My job. Anything else?

464
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,995
Let's go to work.

465
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,993
Listen to me!

466
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,435
- Who are you looking for?
- Raza.

467
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,270
There are things that...

468
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,712
Captain.

469
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,269
What?

470
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,395
Carlos, I won't take long.

471
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,951
I know.

472
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,314
- How was it?
- Okay.

473
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,832
- Carlos?
- Yeah?

474
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,879
- Want some tequila?
- Oh, good. Thank you, friend.

475
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,913
Where are you all going?
I'm right here.

476
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,196
Good night.

477
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,312
- See the woman?
- Yes.

478
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,471
- Talk to her yet?
- No.

479
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,996
- How much time we got?
- About eight minutes.

480
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,470
- Listen to me!
- Go on.

481
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,114
- Go to hell!
- You go to hell!

482
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,271
I don't give a shit!

483
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,871
That Chiquita,
she can lick a whole regiment...

484
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,157
...but she can't dance a lick.

485
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,990
You. Go away!

486
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,628
Amigo, we've been had.
Let's get the hell out of here.

487
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,552
- No.
- No!

488
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:04,678
Do exactly as I said.

489
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,632
The senora.

490
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:20,193
Speak only what I told you.
Nothing more, nothing less.

491
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,396
Call them.

492
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,038
Rico. All clear.

493
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,069
By the way, I forgot to bring
your wooden cross...

494
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,310
...your upside-down cross.

495
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,279
Cease fire!

496
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,029
Cease fire!
You're going to injure the senora.

497
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,313
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!

498
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,833
They're afraid to hit the woman.

499
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,878
Your position is hopeless.

500
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,998
Put down your weapons.

501
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,432
Get up.

502
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,479
Come on, baby. Let's go.

503
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,878
Don't shoot.

504
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,511
Release the woman!

505
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,511
Release her!

506
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,514
Shoot.

507
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,159
Do as I say.

508
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,914
Shoot.

509
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,197
One shot from you, I'll kill her.

510
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,469
Get your men off that train.

511
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,471
Move!

512
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,553
Now!

513
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,278
Let's go! Outside.

514
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:33,599
Three against four. What happened?

515
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,399
- Feels like a busted rib.
- You're lucky.

516
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,120
The bullet went clean through.

517
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,439
Your hands are filthy.

518
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,239
What's it to you if he lives or dies?

519
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,597
If he lives, we'll have to slow down.

520
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,958
That'll give Raza
a chance to catch up.

521
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,351
She'll work to keep him alive,
all right.

522
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,432
Yes?

523
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,031
Just wondering.

524
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,033
What makes you worth
$100,000?

525
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,639
Go to hell.

526
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,756
Yes, ma'am.

527
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,912
I'm on my way.

528
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,351
Thanks.

529
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,753
How is he?

530
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,230
He will never reach the border.
None of you.

531
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:01,239
You have no chance. You never did.

532
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,913
We knew everything.

533
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,755
From the moment you set foot
in Mexico. Even before.

534
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,593
From the day
my husband sent for you.

535
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,637
Mr. Ortega.

536
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,360
He said he would
give his life for you.

537
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,514
For me, not my husband.
For Raza. For the revolution.

538
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:27,674
From the loyal Ortega to the devoted
goat-keeper, to the faithful wife...

539
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,790
...at the mercy of a brutal kidnapper.
That's one hell of a rigged parlay.

540
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,552
I was not kidnapped.

541
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,673
The old badger game.

542
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,913
Shakedown partners, bed partners.

543
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,031
Cosy.

544
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,438
Raza and I grew up together.
I am born there.

545
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:57,232
When it's the hacienda of my father,
when Raza is only a stable boy.

546
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:02,235
We are lovers long before
Mr. Joe Grant buys the place.

547
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,514
When my father lies dying, he says:

548
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,632
"Mr. Joe Grant wants you
for his wife."

549
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:15,035
"You will become Dona Grant,
a fine lady. That is my wish."

550
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,078
Here, a wish is a command.

551
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:22,317
But I'm very young and very foolish.

552
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,109
I tell Mr. Joe Grant
I cannot marry to him.

553
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,794
I love another man.

554
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,635
Very romantic, no?

555
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,511
Your husband sent you clothes.

556
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,319
I offer you a better bargain than I got.

557
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:53,508
Four lives. Yours, if you let me go.

558
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,956
You better change
before we start back.

559
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,873
It'll be a long ride
on your bare bottom.

560
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,349
Raza!

561
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:17,432
- How much time have we got?
- None.

562
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,392
Get her out. Get her out!

563
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,151
Mario!

564
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,356
Drink it.

565
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,078
See anything?

566
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,231
Sand.

567
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,632
They'll be along.

568
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,554
- How would they know which way?
- Raza will know.

569
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,632
You should have let me finish him.

570
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,558
Why didn't you kill him?

571
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,995
You let Raza live.

572
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,878
Why?

573
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,279
Shall I tell you?

574
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:46,991
You are simpatico. No man was more
loyal to the revolution than you.

575
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,830
I fought like any other man.

576
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,869
Loyalty such as yours, that comes
only from devotion to a cause.

577
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:01,309
That same fire burns in Raza. That is
why you could not see him murdered.

578
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,837
He is a thief, trying to steal
100,000 dollars.

579
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,639
You are a whore
cheating on your husband.

580
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,271
My husband stole millions
from this land, our land.

581
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,070
If we can keep the revolution alive,
with that money, for just a day...

582
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,109
...then I'll steal and cheat,
and whore...

583
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,670
...and anything else
that must be done.

584
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:34,318
You laugh. But you believed
in the revolution once.

585
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,718
What else inspired you
to fight for us?

586
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,950
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.

587
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:46,275
I got inspired one day
in May, 1911, in El Paso.

588
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:51,434
It started suddenly. Shooting, yelling,
bombs going across the Rio Grande.

589
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,513
Everybody ran to see what
the ruckus was about. Me too.

590
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,911
From the top of freight cars
we saw across the river.

591
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:05,030
The Maderistas were taking Juarez.
The revolution had busted wide open.

592
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,430
It was beautiful.

593
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,354
The next thing I know I was
across the border shooting...

594
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,478
...with everybody and yelling,
"Viva Mexico."

595
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:20,189
A month later I was
blowing up trains for Villa.

596
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,078
Yes?

597
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,233
That's it.

598
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,516
Nothing more?

599
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,839
Not even money?

600
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,555
Promised, never paid.

601
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,314
But you stayed. You and this one.

602
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,830
And fought for six years,
the worst years.

603
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,437
It's not our war anymore, Mrs. Grant.

604
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,918
Him, I understand.

605
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,038
An adventurer without principles.

606
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,315
But you?

607
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,869
Change your clothes.

608
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,758
We're leaving.

609
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,194
Raza says you
and he were good friends.

610
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,672
- That's right.
- And yet, you would have killed him.

611
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,273
That's right.

612
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,475
For money.

613
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,278
That's right.

614
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,157
For as much money,
would you let me go?

615
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:56,633
- How long since you had a woman?
- Too long.

616
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,597
You want me?

617
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,709
My price is high.

618
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,308
Freedom.

619
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,519
I might say yes now
and later, no.

620
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,270
I trust you.

621
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,509
I trust you too.

622
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:59,592
You heard the man. We're leaving.

623
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,109
Finished.

624
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:39,038
Try a little salt, ma'am.
Make you feel better.

625
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,397
Ma'am...

626
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,518
Sorry about your horse, ma'am.

627
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,830
- You know something, Rico?
- Here.

628
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,830
That's a lot of woman there.

629
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:23,794
Beautiful. Classy. And guts.

630
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:27,270
Hard enough to kill you,
and soft enough to change you.

631
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,512
Reminds me of another Maria.
Yours.

632
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,717
Amigo, don't con me.

633
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,919
She's going back. If I have
to do it alone, she's going back.

634
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,674
That's what I wanted to hear you say.

635
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,071
What is on your mind besides
100-proof women, 90-proof whiskey...

636
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,800
...and 14-carat gold?

637
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,712
Amigo...

638
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,633
...you just wrote my epitaph.

639
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,031
- How many men?
- Raza and six. Pushing hard.

640
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,472
Moving out.

641
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,997
To make the border,
we gotta be out in three hours.

642
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,391
We got an hour, maybe less.

643
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,278
You have lost.

644
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,196
Win or lose, here and now.

645
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,716
Bottleneck like this,
one of us might hold them off.

646
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,836
- One of us.
- Lf he plays it cool.

647
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,719
Hit and run. Stall and retreat.

648
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,112
Ehrengard needs help.
That's Jake's job.

649
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,794
The woman has to be watched.
That's your job.

650
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,999
- Buying the time we need is my job.
- Whoa, amigo. Slow down.

651
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:58,393
Let's keep this professional. Your job
is to make good our contract.

652
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,994
To deliver the goods. All the way.

653
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,637
That's your job.

654
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:11,870
I got 9000 bucks coming.
In hard cash, please.

655
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:15,635
Take my horse.
You'll need him if Raza gets past me.

656
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,229
Bill.

657
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,872
See you.

658
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,870
Jake.

659
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,351
How are you going to make it back?

660
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,795
Well, how were you?

661
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:33,869
No!

662
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,717
Come on! Go on!

663
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:09,188
Sons of bitches.
Show your faces, bastards.

664
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,154
- Fierro!
- I got one of them.

665
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:42,074
Francisco!

666
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,111
Where are they?

667
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,319
Speak, man. Their positions!

668
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:00,156
Rico!

669
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:03,835
Fierro, is he finished?

670
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,433
Not yet, baby.

671
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,718
Baby.

672
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,554
Amigo.

673
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:31,315
So you are the one
they left to die, huh?

674
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,792
Where did the bullet bite you?

675
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,916
In the ass.

676
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,069
You?

677
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,953
Another two inches, mamacita.

678
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,837
Could you spare one more cigarro?

679
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,110
Why, sure.

680
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,429
Come and get it.

681
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,709
Hey, Fierro!

682
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:15,191
- You want tobacco?
- Smoking is bad for the health.

683
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:36,114
How do you come
to this dirty business?

684
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,236
The usual.

685
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:39,634
Money.

686
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,790
Everything is as usual.

687
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:48,114
I need guns and bullets, as usual.

688
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:53,356
The war goes badly, as usual.

689
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,511
Only you...

690
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,433
...you are not as usual.

691
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,189
Chiquita!

692
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,316
Chiquita!

693
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,634
How's your love life?

694
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,233
Terrific.

695
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:57,989
You want some?

696
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,438
Don't you ever say no?

697
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,397
- Never.
- Anybody?

698
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:06,279
Everybody!

699
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:16,913
You know, of course,
one of us must die.

700
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,470
Maybe both of us.

701
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:26,758
To die for money is foolish.

702
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:30,310
To die for a woman is more foolish.

703
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,835
Any woman, even her.

704
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,195
How long you think to hold us here?

705
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,669
Oh, a couple of hours.

706
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,718
Then what happens
here won't matter.

707
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,595
She'll be Mrs. Joe Grant again.

708
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,236
But that will change nothing.

709
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,313
She is my woman.
Before. Now. Always.

710
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,755
Nothing is for always.

711
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,229
Except death.

712
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,755
Ask Fierro. Ask Francisco.

713
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,276
Ask those in the
cemetery of nameless men.

714
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,958
- They died for what they believed.
- The revolution?

715
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:14,153
When the shooting stops
and the dead buried...

716
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:19,678
...and the politicians take over, it all
adds up to one thing, a lost cause.

717
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,831
So...

718
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,913
You want perfection or nothing.

719
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,674
You're too romantic, compadre.

720
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,833
La Rev olucion
is like a great love affair.

721
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,878
In the beginning, she is a goddess.

722
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:43,195
A holy cause. But every
love affair has a terrible enemy.

723
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:44,918
Time.

724
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,633
We see her as she is.

725
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,469
La Rev olucion is not a goddess,
but a whore.

726
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:00,349
She was never pure,
never saintly, never perfect.

727
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:04,274
So we run away.
Find another lover, another cause.

728
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,193
Quick, sordid affairs.

729
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,191
Lust, but no love.

730
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,399
Passion, but no compassion.

731
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,875
Without love...

732
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:21,793
...without a cause, we are nothing.

733
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,840
We stay because we believe.

734
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,072
We leave because
we are disillusioned.

735
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,755
We come back because we are lost.

736
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,757
We die because we are committed.

737
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,589
You and I together.

738
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,034
I to the front.

739
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,919
- I will go first.
- Do as I say, woman!

740
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,753
A woman he will not shoot.

741
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,118
Jesus!

742
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,556
Hello, baby.

743
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,349
Hello, baby.

744
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:54,390
Long time since I hear "baby."

745
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:01,554
Hey, you ever find...

746
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:05,110
...that damn gold mine?

747
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:22,833
I am not lucky today.

748
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:26,838
But you're beautiful.

749
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,274
Querido, baby.

750
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:36,475
We had some fine times together.

751
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,908
Terrific.

752
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:43,274
Give us a kiss.

753
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,038
Mrs. Grant, let's go.

754
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,994
As long as we're
not pressed for time.

755
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:15,879
Well, in a few minutes she'll be home.

756
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:21,153
Be nice if Bill
was here for the payoff.

757
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:24,028
Be nice if he was here alive.

758
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,998
But stalling around won't make it so.

759
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:31,472
A cloud of dust. Could be Mr. Raza.

760
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,199
Could be most anything.

761
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,238
Even a whirling dervish.

762
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:50,790
That, gentlemen,
is the whirlingest dervish of them all.

763
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,198
- Never thought he'd get out alive.
- And that, gentlemen...

764
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,954
...calls for a celebration.

765
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,154
What's that supposed to mean?

766
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:57,632
Rico, buddy, this will come
as a shock to both of us.

767
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:02,874
- I'm a born sucker for love.
- That bullet knocked your brains out.

768
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,109
Or let some in.

769
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:07,397
What happened back there?
What changed your mind?

770
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:13,672
I found out what makes a woman
worth 100,000 dollars.

771
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,912
You expect me to turn her loose?

772
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,034
Turn her loose? After all we've
been through together?

773
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:24,875
After all the blood it's cost?
Hell, no!

774
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,516
You made a contract to kidnap
a wife for Mr. J.W. Grant.

775
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,994
Now, let's collect that ransom.

776
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,718
Thank you, from the bottom
of my heart. Thank you.

777
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,235
Nicked you a bit, did they?

778
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,389
Help yourself.

779
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:56,035
- I'll get Mrs. Grant.
- That isn't necessary.

780
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:00,079
Hooper! Escort these men
into town. See they're paid in full.

781
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:05,519
Charge hotel bills, whiskey bills,
girl bills, all bills. Anything. On me.

782
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:08,592
You must be anxious
to get a hot bath...

783
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,832
...so it'll have to be adios
and muchas gracias.

784
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,632
- A hot bath.
- Why? Is it Saturday?

785
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:19,236
You did your job and earned
a bust-out. Those are orders.

786
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,989
The contract is not complete until...

787
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,919
...Mrs. Grant is delivered
safe and sound.

788
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:28,755
- The code of the profession?
- Something like that.

789
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:34,278
Very well. I hereby declare
our contract satisfactorily concluded.

790
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:37,238
Not yet. Mrs. Grant...

791
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,152
Thank you.

792
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:40,753
Maria!

793
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:51,479
- Hooper.
- Yes, sir.

794
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,597
Kill him.

795
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,349
No, no.

796
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,433
You haven't earned
the right to kill him.

797
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,354
If it's not too much, I want privacy.

798
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:20,748
- Joseph!
- Not now.

799
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,957
There is nothing to hide.
They know everything.

800
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:27,559
Everything.

801
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:34,393
You're back again.
Nothing else matters.

802
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,438
I will run away again. That matters.

803
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:39,875
You're my wife. You belong to me.

804
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:41,234
I belong here.

805
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,231
- With him?
- With him.

806
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,198
I'd rather see you dead.
You're coming with me!

807
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:47,554
You're going home!

808
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:49,631
- No!
- Yes!

809
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:02,112
Gentlemen, you heard our employer.

810
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,589
The lady's going home.

811
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:14,357
Did you think J.W. Grant was
stupid enough to pay that ransom?

812
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,714
Certainly not.

813
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,391
There was no kidnapping.

814
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:21,959
Right, Mr. Grant?

815
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:29,831
- Right, Mr. Grant?
- That is none of your business.

816
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,479
Wrong, Mr. Grant.

817
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:36,629
We made a contract to save
a lady from a nasty old kidnapper.

818
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,360
Who turns out to be you.

819
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:50,395
We both made a bad deal, Mr. Grant.

820
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:55,429
You lose a wife, and we lose
10,000 dollars apiece.

821
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:59,113
You bastard!

822
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:03,270
Yes, sir.
In my case, an accident of birth.

823
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:08,514
But you, sir,
you're a self-made man.
