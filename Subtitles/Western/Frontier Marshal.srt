1
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,520
Hurry, Doc! Hurry!

2
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,088
- What is it, a baby or a shooting?
- A baby!

3
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,070
Don't forget the grand opening
tomorrow night...

4
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,171
of the Bella Union.

5
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:31,911
Pretty girls.
Sweet singers of southern song.

6
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,351
Hello, Carter.
I see you're opening up here.

7
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,854
Yep. They run me out of Lordsburg.

8
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,120
Well, boys, in a couple of hours, you'll
be buying your drinks across that bar...

9
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:44,323
at the Palace of Pleasure.

10
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,398
Listen to this, Eddie.

11
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,876
"Yesterday, Big Nose Jackson
was buried in Boot Hill.

12
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,573
"He was shot to death
by an unknown party.

13
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,878
"Joe Triplett, who officiates
as coroner...

14
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,249
"when not busy in the assay office,
rendered the following verdict:

15
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,311
"Body rich in lead...

16
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,482
too badly punctured
to hold whiskey."'

17
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,787
"We are growing rapidly,
but it is getting to be a question...

18
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,798
"whether the city or the cemetery
will be the larger.

19
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,893
"If the city can just keep a few steps ahead
of the burial ground...

20
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,963
"we are bound to become the most
flourishing camp in the Southwest.

21
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,032
Watch us grow."

22
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,166
- Hiya, boss.
- Hi.

23
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,871
Been eatin' dust for 10 hours.

24
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,277
- Got anything to drink in there?
- A drop or two.

25
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,339
You stay with the horses, Charlie.

26
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,510
Can't let Charlie drink.
Sees little bugs.

27
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,350
We'll send you out some agua.

28
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,152
Agua.

29
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,196
- Have any trouble, Curly?
- Nope. Got the stage comin' through the pass.

30
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,035
Driver handed over the money
like it was a real pleasure.

31
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,734
- How are things around here?
- Not so good.

32
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,344
Bella Union getting all the play, eh?

33
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,250
Yeah. Jerry and those girls from Chicago
are drawin' 'em in like flies.

34
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,346
Sure doin' a land office business
over there.

35
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,551
- Hey, maybe we can do something about it.
- What do you mean?

36
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,617
Charlie.

37
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,965
- For me?
- Sure. Take a big swig.

38
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,162
- More?
- Take all you want.

39
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:27,120
Rock-a-bye, baby
in the treetop

40
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:31,789
When the wind blows
the cradle will rock

41
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,579
Out of the way!

42
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,785
Come on.
What's the trouble?

43
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,917
Indian Charlie.
He-He's killed Plush Sullivan.

44
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,394
Maybe some more folks by this time.
He's a-tearin' our place up.

45
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:08,958
- Go over and get him, Marshal.
- Not me, Mr. Henderson. I aim to live a while.

46
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,267
- What's that?
- I'm not gonna walk over there
and get my head blown off.

47
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,242
Mr. Marshal, as mayor of Tombstone,
I order you to arrest him.

48
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,576
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,
but I got a wife and kids.

49
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,616
And Charlie ain't the kind
that you can arrest when he's rampaging.

50
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,643
Why, I wouldn't have a chance. He'd fill me full
of lead before I got halfway through that door.

51
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,282
- Oh, so you won't do it?
- A nice lot of law you got here.

52
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,690
- Who said that?
- I did.

53
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,662
- Who are you?
- Just a visitor tryin' to get some sleep.

54
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,699
But how can I with all this whoopin'
and a-yellin' and a-shootin'?

55
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,861
What kinda town you got here?
A drunk goes loco with a gun and...

56
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,099
- Oh, you talk too much.
- Maybe, but if it was any of my business...

57
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,199
I'd go across there and pull
that tinhorn out by the heels.

58
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,177
- Oh, you would, would you?
- If it was any of my business.

59
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,205
Yes? Well, you come down here,
and I'll make it your business.

60
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,899
I'm deputizing you as marshal.

61
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,833
Go on.
Drag him out by the heels.

62
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,168
All right.
Lend me a gun?

63
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,969
Here it is.

64
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,306
Don't worry.
You'll never get to use it.

65
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,819
You know who he is?

66
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:42,486
No. But we'll find out
at his inquest.

67
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,260
You're under arrest.
Put down those guns.

68
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,131
You heard me.
Put those guns down.

69
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,639
What did I told you?

70
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,809
I don't reckon Charlie give him
much of a chance to use my gun.

71
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,487
Do you see what I see?

72
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,632
He ain't dead.
Just sorta grazed him.

73
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,471
He'll come to in a few minutes,
and you can lock him up.

74
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,411
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll go back and get some sleep.

75
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,080
- Who are you?
- My name's Earp.

76
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,279
- Wyatt Earp?
- You know me?

77
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,345
Certainly have heard of you.

78
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,290
General Miles says
you're the best scout the army ever had.

79
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,452
What brings you to Tombstone?
Prospecting?

80
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,519
No. Thought I might
start a stage line.

81
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,690
No, we got two here now
that I run.

82
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,326
No room for another one.
How would you like to be marshal?

83
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,496
- Me?
- Yes. Job pays 500 a month and fees.

84
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,597
- No.
- Now listen...

85
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,040
Sorry, but I've had
enough of gun-totin'.

86
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,604
Nah. You're fired.

87
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,786
Turn around and move.

88
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,660
- Who is it?
- Earp.

89
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,189
Just a minute.

90
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,840
- Why, Earp, what happened?
- That job of marshal still open?

91
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,940
- Yeah.
- Then I'll take it.

92
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,451
- Good.
- Do these go with the job?

93
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,010
Sure do.

94
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,353
Let me get my pants on.
I'll go with you.

95
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,460
Ain't gonna be no more volunteer
marshals around this camp!

96
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,323
Put it up on the bar!

97
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,569
Don't reach.

98
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,982
Don't you lads try anything.

99
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,722
You might get me, but first
I'll blast him right in the belly.

100
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,365
You two boys and Curly Bill,
get goin'.

101
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,849
What's up?

102
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,487
I got a little business
with these boys out on the mesa.

103
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,554
Oh, I see.

104
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,759
Think you'd better take
the guns from 'em?

105
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,201
Nope. I'd just as soon
they try to use 'em.

106
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,262
Get goin'.

107
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,414
Come on. Get down.

108
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,020
Take off those guns.

109
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,033
Throw 'em away.

110
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,833
Now let's see what you can do
when nobody's holdin' me.

111
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,798
Just keep 'em up.

112
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,253
Get this, and get it
good and clear.

113
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,321
From now on,
I'm the law in Tombstone...

114
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,197
and I don't wanna see
hide nor hair of you in the camp.

115
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:16,469
Come and see Eddie Foy,
the funnyman...

116
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:18,674
- tonight at the Bella Union!
- Can I have one, sonny?

117
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,774
Eddie Foy! Eddie Foy!

118
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,013
How you like that, boss?

119
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,286
- Very good, Pete. Very good.
- I think it's pretty good.

120
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,623
Must be costing you plenty
to get Foy down here.

121
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:33,219
Yep. Carter tried to get him
for his Palace of Pleasure...

122
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:36,391
but my dough talked
louder and quicker than his.

123
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,129
Nothin' ain't too good
for the Bella Union.

124
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:42,639
- Someday I figures on getting Lillie Langtry.
- Yeah?

125
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:45,470
- Jenny Lind and all of them.
- Hmm.

126
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,568
6:30. That stage must be late.

127
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:50,045
- Is Foy on it?
- He better be.

128
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:52,548
Supposin' he gets cold feet
and backs out?

129
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,811
Well, I still have Jerry.

130
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,895
Stand back, villain

131
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:08,591
Go your way

132
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:13,569
Here I will no longer stay

133
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:16,765
Although you are a marquis

134
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:20,174
Or an earl

135
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:24,943
Why, you may tempt
the upper classes

136
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:30,578
With your villainous demitasses

137
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:36,354
But heaven will protect

138
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:41,956
The working girl

139
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,469
I've taken a fancy to you

140
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:57,571
I took but a glance and I knew

141
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,708
There's something about you
that pleases the eye

142
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:03,947
Makes me sigh
I wonder why

143
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:07,821
I've known you forever it seems

144
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:11,589
You've shown up in all of my dreams

145
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:15,291
- But now I'm awake
and my dreams have come true

146
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:18,893
I'm full of romance
and I've taken a fancy

147
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:22,097
To Y-O-U

148
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:25,767
Oh, heaven

149
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:29,176
Will protect

150
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:34,115
The working girl

151
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:39,121
The working girl

152
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:48,926
- Come on, gals. Get to work.
And may heaven protect you.

153
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:54,761
Hiya, partner.

154
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,829
Hello, slugger.
No, a little later.

155
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:59,102
- Jerry, how are ya?
- Come on, Jerry. Give me luck.

156
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:01,838
- No, I'll see you later.
- Jerry, have a little drink with...

157
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:05,109
I say, would you mind singing
"The Old Kent Road" for me?

158
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:09,346
Yeah, a little later, matey. I ain't forgot me London.

159
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,828
Well, Jerry, old girl.
Another bottle of wine.

160
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,229
- Another bottle.
- Come on. Sit down and take a hand, huh?

161
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:25,530
- Nah, I just think I'll stand here
and watch for a minute. Go ahead.
- How many?

162
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:30,336
Well, l-I could stand pat,
but I'll... I'll take two.

163
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:35,868
Three of your best.

164
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:39,973
- Come on. Let's keep out the grocery clerks.
- I'm out.

165
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:48,221
Guess your three
are better than mine.

166
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:51,489
Attaboy.

167
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,553
Deal me out of this hand.

168
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:57,328
Hey, Jerry, Jer...

169
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:59,767
Hey, where's that guy
goin' with Jerry?

170
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,163
Hey, what's the idea?
What do you want?

171
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,572
I don't think I'd do that
anymore if I was you.

172
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,941
- Do what anymore?
- You got a pretty little neck, sister...

173
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:11,504
but if you don't keep it out of card games,
somebody's gonna twist it right off.

174
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:15,109
I don't know what you're talking about.
Keep your hands off of me!

175
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,414
Hey, put me down!
Leave go of me!

176
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,515
Leave go of me, will ya?

177
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:23,787
- Think it over while you're cooling off.
- Aw, shut up!

178
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:29,929
I'll get somebody to fix you!

179
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:33,759
2,400.

180
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:37,364
- Hey, what'd you do with Jerry?
- I sent her home to change her dress.

181
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:40,069
What's the idea?
I liked the dress she had on.

182
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:44,911
So did I, but it took Mr. Blackmore's mind off
his cards. Isn't that right, Mr. Blackmore?

183
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,981
- Whose deal?
- I'll buy a stack.

184
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:57,058
It's Doc Halliday.!

185
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,118
What's up?

186
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,221
Keep on playin'.
Act like nothin' happened.

187
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,289
- What has happened?
- Doc Halliday just come in.

188
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,440
He's the coldest killer in these parts.

189
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:18,447
Always lookin' for trouble.
He can throw a gun faster...

190
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,745
Shh. Look out.
He's comin' this way.

191
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:31,289
Newton, I hear you've been bragging
about what you were going to do if...

192
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:34,194
- Who, um, me?
- Yes.

193
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:36,664
And take your hat off
when I talk to you!

194
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,138
- Take hold and pull your gun.
- Not me.

195
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:45,801
- Ah, come on.
- I don't want any handkerchief
duels with you, Doc...

196
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:47,867
or any other kind of a fight.

197
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:50,846
No? Well, maybe this
will change your mind.

198
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:56,147
Are you gonna sit by and watch me
treat your friend like this?

199
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,587
Uh, he-he ain't
no friend of mine, Doc.

200
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,854
He'd better not
try anything with me.

201
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,865
I don't like the way
you're running this town.

202
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:21,240
And I especially don't like the way
you treated a certain young lady.

203
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,707
Take hold of...

204
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:30,044
You always want an edge,
don't you, Blackmore?

205
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,614
Suppose you wait till he quits coughing.

206
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:42,830
Thanks, Mr. Earp.
Now if you'll please step aside...

207
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,233
No, Doc. I'm the marshal here, you know.
I got to keep the peace.

208
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:50,238
Yes. Of course, of course.

209
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:53,333
- Will you join me in a drink?
- Glad to.

210
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,106
Better try another camp.
This one's unhealthy.

211
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:00,875
- What can I do for you senors?
- Whiskey.

212
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:03,215
Whiskey, eh?
Milk for you.

213
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:06,256
- That's right, Pete.
- Doc always drink milk.

214
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:10,726
He never drink whiskey.
Una leche. One milk.

215
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:13,524
Papa, papa, the stage is coming!
The stage is coming!

216
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:16,862
Pablo, ven aqui.
Ven, Pablo.

217
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:22,097
- Hello, Pablo.
- You ought to be home with your mother.

218
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:25,232
I'm his mama and his papa.

219
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,574
And someday I'm gonna be his grandpa too.

220
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:32,741
Pablo is very good boy.
He has no mama. He only has me.

221
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:34,807
If there only were a school.

222
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:37,820
There's gonna be one soon.
Anderson and I were talking it over yesterday.

223
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,618
Oh, that's fine.
Then Pablo can go there.

224
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,751
And I bet you he be the smartest boy there.
Smart like his papa.

225
00:22:43,827 --> 00:22:47,126
Oh, I'm pretty clever himself.

226
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:49,188
Giddap!

227
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:58,168
Welcome to Tombstone, Mr. Foy.

228
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:01,473
- Mr. Foy, welcome to Tombstone.
- Well, I'm glad to be here.

229
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,775
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to meet Eddie Foy...

230
00:23:03,847 --> 00:23:05,838
the greatest comedian in the world.

231
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,282
Tonight at 9:00
he'll be at the Bella Union.

232
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:13,483
Come one, come all, and laugh your cares away.

233
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:18,795
Howdy, folks.
Is this my hotel?

234
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,763
Yes, sir. Follow me.
Your baggage will be taken care of.

235
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:34,035
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm in a hurry. Business in Tucson.

236
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,220
Now this was originally
a Buntline special...

237
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:54,696
but I had the barrel cut down about two inches
and the trigger dogs smoothed down.

238
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,858
Mm. Nice piece of hardware.

239
00:23:56,934 --> 00:24:00,392
Personally, I've been using
a Colt.45 single-action six-gun.

240
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,870
I guess the barrel's longer
than yourn. Let's see.

241
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:07,910
No, no! No, senor! No.

242
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:14,841
Doc, can I talk
with you a minute?

243
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:17,284
- Oh, yes, of course. Excuse me, will you?
- Sure.

244
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,402
So that's the way you're takin' care
of Earp for me.

245
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:38,270
Why, you've got him all wrong, my dear.
Wyatt's a fine fellow.

246
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:41,402
Hmm. A fine feller
after what he done to me.

247
00:24:41,478 --> 00:24:45,278
Well, Jerry, if he threw you in the water trough,
I guess you had it comin' to you.

248
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:49,410
Oh, yeah? Well, he may be all right
to you, but he ain't to me.

249
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:53,047
No tinhorn marshal's gonna throw me
in a horse trough and get away with it.

250
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:56,957
Well, forget about Earp.
Is that a new dress?

251
00:24:57,027 --> 00:24:59,188
Yeah. Yeah.

252
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:04,124
- You like me in it?
- Come here.

253
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,192
I like you in anything.

254
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:11,301
Gee, you're sweet.

255
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:15,368
You know, Doc,
I've been thinkin' about you all day.

256
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:17,777
Do you ever think of me
when I ain't with you?

257
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:20,476
- Yeah.
- Lots?

258
00:25:21,718 --> 00:25:23,879
Too much.

259
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:28,653
You know, sometimes when you look at me
like that, I could break you in two.

260
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:31,455
Well, why don't you?

261
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:35,624
Come on. Break me.

262
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:41,126
Look, Doc, I'm getting off early tonight.
Maybe we could...

263
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:44,139
No, no. Not tonight.

264
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:52,747
- Where you going, Doc?
- Faro bank. I feel lucky. See you later.

265
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:54,943
Hey, Jerry, where've you been?

266
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:59,682
How's about you and me findin' a cozy corner
and a nice cold bottle of wine, huh?

267
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:02,691
If it's all right with you, cutie, I'll take a rain check.

268
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,700
Something I can do for you, lady?

269
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:24,212
Yes. I'm looking for John Halliday.

270
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:27,045
John? Oh, you mean Doc Halliday?

271
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:30,052
Yes.

272
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,681
Uh, you'll find him over there,
buckin' the tiger.

273
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:50,196
Sarah.

274
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:53,466
Hello, John.

275
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:59,176
What are you doing here?

276
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:06,520
Cash me in. Come on.
Let's sit over here.

277
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:16,428
Can I... get you
something to drink, to eat?

278
00:27:16,498 --> 00:27:18,489
No, John.

279
00:27:22,905 --> 00:27:25,601
- Did you just arrive on the stage?
- Yes.

280
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:30,502
How did you find out where I was?

281
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:33,104
Well, I've been searching
for two years.

282
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,908
Why did you do it, John?

283
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:40,846
What else was there to do?

284
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:44,415
I couldn't fasten
a dying man onto you.

285
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,291
I was a sick dog,
and I snuck away like a sick dog.

286
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:49,422
Without even saying good-bye.

287
00:27:49,498 --> 00:27:53,525
- I felt it was best that way.
- Best for you perhaps.

288
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:55,593
I hoped it would be for you too.

289
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:59,129
It wasn't very flattering to me, John,
for you to think my love so weak.

290
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:02,234
No. No, Sarah.

291
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:05,576
I knew you'd insist on going through
with the marriage no matter what.

292
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:08,707
That's why I left.
I couldn't take advantage of you.

293
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:12,880
- That's why I had to leave.
- And now you see it was no use.

294
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:15,150
Here I am.

295
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:18,284
Yes, here you are.

296
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,090
- But you can't stay, Sarah. You've got to go.
- Why, John?

297
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:24,064
Because it's not right.
You don't know me. I'm a stranger.

298
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:27,227
- You?
- Yes, Sarah. Sick or well...

299
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:29,896
I'm not the John Halliday
you knew back in Illinois.

300
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:32,600
I'm nothing like him. There's no resemblance
at all. You don't know...

301
00:28:32,674 --> 00:28:36,235
Oh, I do know.
They've told me all about you.

302
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:40,407
In Dodge City, in Globe, in Tucson,
in Lordsburg, all through the West.

303
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:43,508
"Doc Halliday, the killer, '
they called you.

304
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:45,746
"Killer"?

305
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:51,020
John Halliday, the kind young doctor
who leaned over sick babies all night?

306
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:54,824
John Halliday, who cried
when Mrs. Foster died in childbirth?

307
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:58,128
- John Halliday...
- I don't want to hear anymore.

308
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,193
Yes, I'm a killer. What of it?
Life's nothing... my life, anybody's life.

309
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:04,364
What's the difference
what happens to a lot of rats...

310
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,533
caught in a trap...
what they do, how they act?

311
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:08,940
Sarah, you've got to go.

312
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:11,878
No, John.
I've searched too long.

313
00:29:11,947 --> 00:29:14,973
But I don't want you.

314
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,486
- You don't mean that, John.
- Yes, I do. It's got to be that way, Sarah.

315
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:22,513
You don't know everything. You'd leave
quickly enough if I told you...

316
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:25,253
All right, Doc.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

317
00:29:28,397 --> 00:29:30,627
Thanks, Jerry, darling.

318
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:35,863
So, now you see
how things stand, don't you?

319
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:37,963
There's a stage out in the morning.

320
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,235
Go on back where you belong
and leave me alone.

321
00:29:42,444 --> 00:29:46,380
There's a side door over there.
I think you'll find it's the quickest way out.

322
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:52,551
Hello, Doc. Oh, I know.

323
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:54,919
I got it for you right away.

324
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:59,417
Here's your milk.

325
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,725
Who said I wanted that?
Whiskey.

326
00:30:01,797 --> 00:30:04,823
Whiskey?
Sure, si, whiskey.

327
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:19,041
What's the matter? Didn't you ever
see anybody drink whiskey before?

328
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:21,742
No. I never see you drink whiskey.

329
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:23,842
Well, you're seein' me now.

330
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,910
I think I do.

331
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:34,095
- They're gonna do it. They're gonna do it.
- Do what?

332
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:37,188
Hurrah our show tonight...
the Palace of Pleasure crowd.

333
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:40,099
Oh, I've heard some talk about 'em
makin' trouble here, but don't worry.

334
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:42,363
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Well, but are you sure, mister?

335
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:44,769
L- I've got a lot of money
tied up in Foy.

336
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,967
Forget all about it.
That's what I'm here for...

337
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:49,374
to give you protection and see
that nobody bothers you.

338
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:52,470
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, l-l-l-I don't know.

339
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:02,689
Come in.

340
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,055
I've come for you, Foy.

341
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:12,896
Oh, yes? I'll be ready in a minute.

342
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:15,266
There's a big crowd
over at the Bella Union?

343
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:19,273
- I wouldn't know. You ain't goin' there.
- What did you say?

344
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:21,605
I said you wasn't goin'
to the Bella Union.

345
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:23,838
You're gonna do your act
at the Palace of Pleasure.

346
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:25,937
Why, there must be some mistake.

347
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:28,505
The Palace did make me an offer,
but my contract calls for...

348
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:30,609
Don't talk so much and finish up.

349
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:33,678
We'll pay you your dough.
But you better be funny.

350
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:36,622
Oh, yes. Uh, I'll be funny, all right.

351
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:38,683
I'll do my best.

352
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,354
Might be a little nervous,
but I guess that happens.

353
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,093
Well, guess we'll get along now, eh?

354
00:31:54,776 --> 00:31:58,872
Ladies and gents,
we got a big surprise for you tonight.

355
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:01,677
Instead of appearin'
in that cheap joint across the street...

356
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,379
like maybe you seen advertised,
Eddie Foy will appear here.

357
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:11,458
Now, I don't need to tell you
how good he is.

358
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:15,018
You maybe seen him in other camps.
But anyhow, you've heard about him.

359
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:18,533
- Eddie Foy!
- All right. Don't try nothin'funny.

360
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,467
- Nothing funny?
- You know what I mean. I'll be right here with this.

361
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:24,869
Go on.

362
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:30,071
All right. Give him a hand.

363
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,249
Sunday morning just at 9:00

364
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,652
Dan McGinty dressed so fine

365
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:44,385
Stood looking up
at a very high stone wall

366
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:46,484
When his friend, young Pat McGann

367
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:48,552
Says I'll bet five dollars, Dan

368
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,327
I could carry you to the top
without a fall

369
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:56,701
So on his shoulders he took Dan
to climb the ladder he began

370
00:32:56,772 --> 00:33:00,538
And he soon commenced
to reach up near the top

371
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:02,600
When McGinty
the cute old rogue

372
00:33:02,678 --> 00:33:04,908
To win the five, he did let go

373
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,949
Never thinking
just how far he had to drop

374
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:10,450
Oh

375
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,580
Down went McGinty
to the bottom of the wall

376
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:18,387
And though he won the five
he was more dead than alive

377
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,897
Sure, his ribs and nose and back
were broke from getting such a fall

378
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:26,422
Dressed in his best suit of clothes

379
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:43,450
- Hello, Doc.
- Get away from me.

380
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:46,779
Doc... He drink whiskey
like crazy man.

381
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:48,880
Yeah, I been noticin'.

382
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:51,551
Always Doc says
whiskey no good for him.

383
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:54,789
He say, "Someday when I want
a quick way out, I drink whiskey."

384
00:33:54,863 --> 00:33:56,990
- "Quick way out," eh?
- Yeah, that's what he told me.

385
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:59,158
- They... They've kidnapped him.
- Who?

386
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:01,327
- Eddie Foy. He's over at the Palace of Pleasure.
- Yeah?

387
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:03,928
Maybe he changed his mind,
and that's where he wants to be.

388
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:07,668
No, it ain't. They came over to the hotel
and got him. It was Buck Newton.

389
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:09,802
Oh. In that case,
I better look into it.

390
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:17,748
- Where you goin', Earp?
- Over the Palace of Pleasure.
They've kidnapped Foy.

391
00:34:17,819 --> 00:34:20,583
I'll go with you.
There might be some excitement.

392
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:38,028
Stop it.

393
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:40,131
Stop it and come down
off of there.

394
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:43,302
Come with me, Mr. Foy.
You belong across the street.

395
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,006
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

396
00:34:46,081 --> 00:34:48,072
Go on. Drop 'em.

397
00:34:49,785 --> 00:34:52,219
Pringle, we mustn't disappoint
the audience.

398
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:54,812
Suppose you get out there
and finish that dance yourself.

399
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,017
- Who, me?
- Hey, music.

400
00:34:57,092 --> 00:34:59,322
But, Doc, l-I can't dance.

401
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:01,453
Go on, dance!

402
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,227
Aren't you oversteppin'
your authority, Marshal...

403
00:35:10,305 --> 00:35:12,865
- comin' in here and interfering in my business?
- I've been pretty patient...

404
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:15,910
with you, Carter, but if you insist,
I'll lock you up for kidnapping.

405
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:30,819
- Wasn't that shooting I heard?
- Yeah, over the Palace of Pleasure.

406
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:34,328
A man named Doc Halliday just shot a man
who tried to shoot the marshal.

407
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:38,127
Any of you other gentlemen care
to shoot Mr. Earp in the back?

408
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:45,229
Come on.
Let's clean the whole place out.

409
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,867
No, no. No more, Doc.
We've done our job.

410
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:50,002
Come on.
Let's go back to Bella Union.

411
00:35:57,152 --> 00:35:59,143
Come on, Mr. Foy!

412
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:16,065
Here's your comedian,
not much the worse for wear.

413
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:19,265
Thanks, Marshal.
Glad to see you alive, Mr. Foy.

414
00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:21,809
- I need a drink.
- Come with me.

415
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:25,506
- Whiskey.
- Oh, si. Whiskey.

416
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:31,585
- Keep on with that, you'll be dead before morning.
- Yeah? Good.

417
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:33,814
Even if you don't kill yourself
with that stuff, Doc...

418
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:35,914
somebody'll kill you sure
before the night's out.

419
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:38,152
You wouldn't stand a Chinaman's chance
of defending yourself.

420
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:41,161
I can take care of myself.
I don't need anybody to look after me.

421
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:43,254
- I know what I'm doing.
- Now, listen, Doc...

422
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:47,324
Oh, what's the difference anyway?
She's gone away.

423
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:49,666
Why you sendin' her away, Doc?

424
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:52,502
Why?

425
00:36:52,574 --> 00:36:56,510
What do you want me to do, saddle her
with this rotten, stinking body?

426
00:36:56,578 --> 00:36:59,308
I don't want to talk about it.
You keep out of my affairs.

427
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,774
- Doc, don't drink anymore.
- Huh?

428
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,842
Please don't, Doc.
You've had enough.

429
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,254
You leave me alone, or I'll twist your neck.
Go on. Go away.

430
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:11,758
I don't like you.

431
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:15,023
I think I'll finish you off right now.

432
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:17,121
Doc.!

433
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:19,962
- Why, you-you broke my-my glass!
- I don't like you either!

434
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:22,026
No, Doc!

435
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:24,367
You didn't have to do that.

436
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:28,432
- If you'd have left him to me,
I'd have taken care of him.
- Hey, Bill, lend me a hand.

437
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:37,708
Don't let a little shooting
annoy you, Mr. Foy.

438
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:39,811
The boys don't mean
no harm by it.

439
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:42,789
- That's just their way of having fun.
- Well, that's very nice...

440
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:45,553
but I was under the impression
I came here to cause the fun.

441
00:37:45,627 --> 00:37:48,221
So you did, Mr. Foy.
So you did.

442
00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:51,356
- And if you're half as funny
as I have heard you are...

443
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:53,731
You'll have nothing
to worry about.

444
00:37:55,937 --> 00:38:00,033
Where's Eddie Foy?
Hey, where's Eddie Foy? No?

445
00:38:00,108 --> 00:38:02,133
Oh, there you are.

446
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,338
Hey, I was a-watchin' you over
at the Palace of Pleasure dancin'...

447
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:07,711
when you was so rudely interrupted.

448
00:38:07,782 --> 00:38:09,807
Now I wanna see you dance again.

449
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:12,478
- I know, but I was just dancing...
- I said dance!

450
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,653
Now, gentlemen,
the drinks are on me.

451
00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:05,530
- Who is it?
- It's the marshal.

452
00:39:05,607 --> 00:39:07,598
Has anything happened to John?

453
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:09,768
No, no.
I got to talk to you tonight.

454
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:12,142
Well, just a minute.

455
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:27,290
- What is it?
- You leaving town tomorrow?

456
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:29,387
- Yes.
- You mustn't.

457
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:32,661
- Mustn't? Why not?
- Because Doc needs you. You can't go away.

458
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:36,465
Well, it isn't a question
of my going away.

459
00:39:36,538 --> 00:39:39,405
John is sending me away.

460
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:43,308
Ma'am, l... I don't know what you've been to Doc.
I know very little about you and him.

461
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:46,472
- But I can tell you this: If you leave, he's a goner.
- A goner?

462
00:39:46,548 --> 00:39:48,573
Doc ain't caring
what happens to him...

463
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,108
and I've got a hunch that you're the only one
that can make him care.

464
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:55,122
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

465
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,024
John doesn't need me.
Not anymore.

466
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:01,187
Aren't you talking
to the wrong person?

467
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,431
Say, you don't think Jerry means
anything to him, do you?

468
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,697
- Well, doesn't she?
- Not a thing. She's crazy about him...

469
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,671
but as far as he goes,
she's just a...

470
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,798
You're the only one that counts.

471
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,309
It isn't her picture
he's carrying around in his wallet.

472
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,368
Doc's eatin' out
his heart over you.

473
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:21,381
He wants you, but he doesn't
want to saddle you with a sick man.

474
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:24,714
- Between the two notions, he's almost loco.
- Well, what can I do?

475
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:27,949
Stay and put up a fight.
If anybody can save him, you can.

476
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:32,184
If I were just sure you were right.

477
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,694
I am right.
You're his only chance.

478
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:38,388
What do you say?

479
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:42,662
- All right. I'm going to stay.
- Good.

480
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:46,969
- Don't let Jerry bother you.
I think I can take care of her.
- Thank you. You're very kind.

481
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,373
Doc'll need a lot of tender nursing
when he comes to.

482
00:40:49,444 --> 00:40:51,742
- I'll take care of him.
- That's fine. Good night, ma'am.

483
00:40:51,813 --> 00:40:53,804
Good night.

484
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,457
I want to talk to you
a minute, Jerry.

485
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:10,896
- What about?
- Doc. Come on.

486
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:13,167
Oh.

487
00:41:15,102 --> 00:41:18,538
- Sit down, Jerry.
- I can hear just as good standing.

488
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:22,871
Take it easy. I'm not here to rawhide you.
I'm going to ask you for a favor.

489
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:25,138
You ask me a favor?

490
00:41:25,212 --> 00:41:27,612
- Yeah, I want you to give Doc a break.
- Do what?

491
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:31,913
- He's in a bad way, Jerry,
and you're not good for him.
- Oh, no?

492
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:34,476
No. But there's somebody
in town who is.

493
00:41:34,555 --> 00:41:38,582
And if you think a lot of Doc and want
to help him, you'll get out of her way.

494
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,459
Her way? You talkin' about that
high-nosed dame over the hotel?

495
00:41:42,529 --> 00:41:45,396
Say, listen. Doc doesn't care
two hoots about her.

496
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:48,764
Oh, yes, he does.
More than he'll ever care for anyone.

497
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:52,430
- She means life to him.
- What am I, a funeral?

498
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:56,907
- Say, does Doc know you're talking to me?
- No.

499
00:41:56,977 --> 00:42:01,573
No? Well, wait'll he finds out.
He'll twist that tin star around your heart.

500
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:05,914
Doc don't stand for anybody
buttin' into his affairs, and I don't neither.

501
00:42:05,986 --> 00:42:10,150
Say, if you like the dame so well,
why don't you grab her off for yourself?

502
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:12,317
- Now, listen, Jerry...
- I won't.

503
00:42:12,392 --> 00:42:15,020
You've been buttin' into
my affairs ever since you came here.

504
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:17,996
You try and bust up things
between Doc and me...

505
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:22,001
and I'll make it
the sorriest day of your life.

506
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:30,199
- I want to talk with you.
- What's up?

507
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:32,871
- Got a complaint from the Palace of Pleasure?
- No.

508
00:42:32,946 --> 00:42:35,813
No, it serves Pringle right.

509
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:39,511
- I want you to ride shotgun
on my stage tomorrow.
- Yeah? Why?

510
00:42:39,586 --> 00:42:43,955
There may be nothing to it, but a rumor has come
to me that Curly Bill might try a holdup.

511
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:46,356
- We're shipping out a lot of bullion.
- I see.

512
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:48,519
Now here's the plan.
We'll ship tomorrow...

513
00:42:48,595 --> 00:42:51,826
that is, Sunday instead of Monday...
and maybe throw them off their guard.

514
00:42:51,898 --> 00:42:55,197
- Good idea.
- You won't have to ride the
stage all the way to Tucson.

515
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:58,864
Just go as far as Grainger's ranch.
He'll give you a horse to come back with.

516
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:01,464
- Okay.
- Stage leaves about 6:00 in the morning.

517
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:18,819
What's the matter with you galoots?

518
00:43:18,892 --> 00:43:21,656
Ain't you ever seen a lady's ankle?

519
00:43:24,798 --> 00:43:28,734
- How's your mine doing?
- Doing very good. She's running
about 500 or 600 to a ton.

520
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:31,100
Well, this is a good place to spend it.

521
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:34,402
- Hey, Ben.
- Why, hello, Jerry. What are you doing here?

522
00:43:34,474 --> 00:43:37,341
- I want to talk to you alone for a minute.
- All right.

523
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:39,675
Come on back to the office.

524
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,116
Well, Jerry.
What's on your mind?

525
00:43:51,191 --> 00:43:54,888
- What'll you give for a
valuable piece of information?
- What kind of information?

526
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:58,522
The stage is going out tomorrow instead
of Monday with a load of silver.

527
00:43:58,598 --> 00:44:03,797
- Why should that interest me?
- Earp's riding shotgun, and
I know you don't like Earp.

528
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,202
Hmm. What else do you know?

529
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:10,232
Well, I happen to know that you
and Curly Bill are like that.

530
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:14,770
You're a smart girl, Jerry. Are you playing me
for a sucker, or do you want a cut in?

531
00:44:14,848 --> 00:44:17,408
No, there's only one way
you can cut me in.

532
00:44:17,484 --> 00:44:20,044
See that Curly Bill
takes care of Earp.

533
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,987
- Oh, you don't like him either.
- No, I don't like him either.

534
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:27,618
The happiest day of my life
will be when I can spit in his coffin.

535
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,917
- Leaving town, Mr. Foy?
- Yes, if I live that long.

536
00:45:29,356 --> 00:45:32,848
Oh! Say, can I ride
up there with you?

537
00:45:32,926 --> 00:45:34,860
Sure. Hop right up.

538
00:45:37,564 --> 00:45:39,828
- All ready, Bill?
- Yup.

539
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,664
I don't think it'll be very safe
for you up there, Mr. Foy.

540
00:45:42,736 --> 00:45:45,762
It isn't very safe for me in there either,
Mr. Marshal.

541
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,307
Huh?

542
00:45:51,445 --> 00:45:54,243
Doc, where are you going?

543
00:45:54,314 --> 00:45:56,441
Tucson.

544
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:59,542
Mr. Foy, you mind holding these?

545
00:46:01,054 --> 00:46:03,921
Get going, Bill.
I'll ride inside with Doc.

546
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:09,225
Giddap!

547
00:46:14,568 --> 00:46:16,763
How come you're riding shotgun?

548
00:46:16,837 --> 00:46:20,034
Bullion.
I'm taking it as far as Grainger's.

549
00:46:20,106 --> 00:46:23,405
We may have a visit
from Curly Bill.

550
00:46:29,115 --> 00:46:31,174
Hmm. Well.

551
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:49,126
Doc!

552
00:46:53,673 --> 00:46:57,040
- Say, where is he?
- I don't know. He was here at daybreak.

553
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,238
Oh, at daybreak.
So you were with him, eh?

554
00:47:00,313 --> 00:47:04,113
Well, he ain't here now. You've driven him away,
that's what you've done. Why, you...

555
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:07,244
Hmm. You girls lookin'
for Doc Halliday?

556
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,413
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- He's gone.

557
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:13,357
- Oh, I know that. But where?
- He took the stage this mornin'.

558
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:15,951
The stage?
Are you sure he took the stage?

559
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:19,328
- Sure I'm sure. I seen him get in.
- They'll kill him.

560
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:23,301
They hate him as much as they do Earp.
They'll kill him, I tell you!

561
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:27,196
That's what they'll do!

562
00:47:27,274 --> 00:47:30,573
Who'll kill who?
What are you talking about?

563
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:34,239
Is John in danger?
Tell me. What is it?

564
00:47:34,314 --> 00:47:36,578
Curly Bill and his gang, they...

565
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,518
Oh! What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?

566
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:44,887
- Well, what have you done?
What's the matter? Tell me!

567
00:48:02,242 --> 00:48:06,008
You don't think I got any pleasure
out of hittin' you over the head, do you?

568
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,445
- I saw you headin' for trouble...
- Suppose I was.

569
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:10,676
After all, I am marshal of Tombstone.

570
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:13,116
When you started to take a shot
at my favorite bartender...

571
00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:15,518
What you did at the Bella Union,
I don't care about.

572
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:18,558
It's interfering in my personal affairs.

573
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:23,324
- Did it ever occur to you to
mind your own business?
- Yes, quite often.

574
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:27,332
- I thought we were friends.
- We were, but that gave you
no right to do what you did.

575
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,527
I had my own plans
for ending a certain situation...

576
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:32,163
and it would've ended that way
if you hadn't interfered.

577
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:36,004
- That's right. I did talk to her.
- Yes. And since the lady has decided to stay...

578
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,874
there's nothing left
for me to do but go.

579
00:48:38,945 --> 00:48:43,405
So, you see, Mr. Earp, sticking your nose into
my business hasn't changed things any.

580
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:48,147
L... I'm sorry you feel that way about it.
I thought I was doing you a good turn.

581
00:48:50,423 --> 00:48:55,190
She's a wonderful gal, Doc. And you'd never
be a burden to her... not to her.

582
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:58,560
You know, all I ever knew about love
is what I've seen of it...

583
00:48:58,632 --> 00:49:00,998
around dance halls
and places like that.

584
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:04,230
But it can be entirely different...
altogether different.

585
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:11,603
Hey, what's the idea of these things?

586
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:14,579
If we run into trouble,
you'll find 'em mighty handy.

587
00:49:14,648 --> 00:49:17,913
Trouble?
I'm not looking for trouble.

588
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:21,045
I mind my own business.

589
00:49:23,023 --> 00:49:26,356
Why don't you change your mind
and go back with me? We can get horses...

590
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:29,088
- Drop the subject! I've had enough of you.
- You have, have you?

591
00:49:29,162 --> 00:49:32,962
You're a crazy fool. I oughta hit you over
the head and drag you back to Tombstone.

592
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:35,934
Yeah? Maybe you'd like to try it.

593
00:49:36,002 --> 00:49:39,904
If I tried it, I'd do it. You've buffaloed a lot
of people in your time...

594
00:49:39,973 --> 00:49:42,874
- Earp, I've got a handkerchief here.
- Go ahead. Pull it.

595
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:48,903
Drop your reins
and get off the box!

596
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:51,974
- It's Curly Bill. He's piled rocks on the road.
- Well, turn around.

597
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:55,215
We'll hold them off
while you're doing it.

598
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:10,062
Come on!

599
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,183
Grab the reins!

600
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:54,339
Well, that takes care of Carter.

601
00:50:54,414 --> 00:50:57,679
- Hey, Doc, you hurt bad?
- No, it's nothing. Just my left arm.

602
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:00,242
Come on.
Move over and give me the reins.

603
00:51:13,632 --> 00:51:16,032
They're coming back!

604
00:51:16,102 --> 00:51:18,832
Something must have happened!

605
00:51:18,904 --> 00:51:21,134
Yo!

606
00:51:21,207 --> 00:51:24,233
Somebody get a doctor.

607
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,938
The doctor is gone to Bisbee.

608
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,810
I'll take care of him.

609
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:41,651
Better luck next time.

610
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:46,958
- Curly Bill?
- Yeah.

611
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:59,073
Ah. So this is Tombstone.

612
00:52:06,018 --> 00:52:08,714
Boiling water.
Get me some boiling water.

613
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:11,552
Get it yourself.
I ain't takin' no orders from you.

614
00:52:11,624 --> 00:52:14,718
Get me some boiling water.

615
00:52:14,794 --> 00:52:17,422
You heard her, Jerry.

616
00:52:17,496 --> 00:52:20,021
Better get some boiling water.

617
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:22,693
All right, Doc... for you.

618
00:52:28,007 --> 00:52:33,536
It's not bad, John. No bone or arteries involved.
I'll put a dressing on it.

619
00:52:33,612 --> 00:52:35,910
All right, Nurse.
It's your case.

620
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:38,279
Huh! Here, now you hold this...

621
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,648
and sit still till I get back.

622
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:49,651
How do you reckon Curly Bill found out
the stage was leavin' on Sunday?

623
00:52:49,728 --> 00:52:53,425
- I got a pretty good idea.
- Yeah?

624
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:16,079
I'm sorry, dear.

625
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:18,214
I didn't know that...

626
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:22,152
You didn't know what?

627
00:53:22,228 --> 00:53:24,492
Oh, nothing, nothing.

628
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,972
Kind of like old times for you.

629
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:41,877
Yes, like old times.

630
00:53:41,947 --> 00:53:45,508
- Remember?
- I remember you driving
through a raging blizzard...

631
00:53:45,584 --> 00:53:48,678
to deliver a baby
at the Wilsons's farm...

632
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:51,814
and then catching pneumonia
and nearly dying.

633
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:54,951
You know, you were
my very first real case, John.

634
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:59,020
I bit your thermometer in two.
Scared you nearly to death.

635
00:53:59,098 --> 00:54:05,003
And left the hospital three weeks too soon
and... had to be nursed all over again.

636
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,972
Well, not a very good job of nursing.

637
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,238
Look at your patient now.

638
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:14,939
If you had obeyed your nurse,
you wouldn't be here now.

639
00:54:15,014 --> 00:54:17,278
All right.

640
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:19,510
All right,
hurry up and get out of here.

641
00:54:19,585 --> 00:54:21,985
Doc and me wants to be alone.

642
00:54:22,054 --> 00:54:24,386
I won't need you anymore.

643
00:54:24,456 --> 00:54:28,358
You won't need me anymore?
Say, you trying to run me out of here?

644
00:54:28,427 --> 00:54:32,363
I'm telling you to leave.

645
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:34,661
Hear what she's saying, Doc?

646
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:38,499
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it.
This is a hospital for the moment.

647
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:43,234
- She's the nurse in charge. I think you better go.
- Hmph.

648
00:54:43,309 --> 00:54:48,076
- I won't. And she can't make me.
- I think I can.

649
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:52,174
- I've had quite some experience with violent cases!
- Aah!

650
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,782
- Hey, what's the idea?
- She threw me out! She threw me out!

651
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:03,294
- Good. That's just where you belong: Out.
- Yeah? If you and that dame...

652
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:07,059
Listen, I've had enough of your nonsense.
You tipped off Carter about the stage.

653
00:55:07,132 --> 00:55:10,260
- Who says so?
- Never mind who says so.
I got every reason to believe...

654
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:13,464
You've got every reason to believe.
Sure, you believe what you just wanna believe.

655
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:16,633
- You've been after me since you come here.
- Let's forget about the stage.

656
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:19,576
But I'm warning you. You keep away
from Halliday and behave yourself...

657
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:21,943
or I'm gonna
run you out of town.

658
00:55:22,014 --> 00:55:24,209
Yeah?

659
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:27,150
- You and who?
- Come on, come on.

660
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:29,312
Get.

661
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,760
There. Comfortable?

662
00:55:43,836 --> 00:55:46,828
No, and I won't be
until you leave Tombstone.

663
00:55:46,905 --> 00:55:49,806
Let's not talk about that anymore.

664
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,571
You've tried your best
to drive me away.

665
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:56,740
You've lied. You've done everything.
But it's no use, John.

666
00:55:56,815 --> 00:56:01,184
I'm staying. I like the town,
I like your friend the marshal...

667
00:56:01,253 --> 00:56:04,848
I wish I could make you understand.
It's all so unfair to you.

668
00:56:04,923 --> 00:56:07,687
- I won't be around long.
- Yes, you will.

669
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,921
Hmm! You're telling the doctor?

670
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:13,089
John, do you remember
in the hospital...

671
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:17,295
- when I read aloud to you from Julius Caesar?
- Yeah.

672
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:21,396
There was a line in the first act
that went something like this:

673
00:56:21,473 --> 00:56:26,376
Cowards die many times
before their death,

674
00:56:26,445 --> 00:56:28,538
the brave but once.

675
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:33,879
- I'm a coward?
- You've become one, John.

676
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:36,512
You're afraid of living,
and you're afraid of dying.

677
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:39,580
No, I'm not afraid of dying.

678
00:56:39,658 --> 00:56:42,218
Yes, afraid of dying.

679
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:46,890
Oh, all this going around killing
and hoping to be killed isn't courage.

680
00:56:46,965 --> 00:56:49,092
Well, that's just a cover for fear.

681
00:56:49,168 --> 00:56:52,501
Why, you're frantic with fear.

682
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:55,734
You're not displaying any more courage
than a Malay who runs amok.

683
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:58,299
Ahh, I don't know what
you're talking about.

684
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:01,312
Well, maybe I'm not
making myself very clear.

685
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:04,474
But my idea of courage...

686
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,677
is taking what's coming to you...

687
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:10,882
without striking out
right and left like a wild man.

688
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:13,322
I believe in fighting, yes...

689
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:16,691
but fighting with
an orderly mind, hopefully.

690
00:57:16,762 --> 00:57:19,663
Oh, words, just words.

691
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:22,199
Well, they're not just words, John.

692
00:57:22,267 --> 00:57:25,259
If you'd forget guns and forget killings...

693
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:27,771
and learn to think calmly and kindly...

694
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,967
you'd get well.

695
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:34,341
That's the way
it's gonna stay... closed.

696
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:37,678
- By whose authority?
- Mine.

697
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:41,515
If you boys want Carter's body, you'll find it
just the other side of the pass.

698
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:44,021
You don't think you've heard
the last of this, do you?

699
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:48,617
- Yeah. I reckon Curly Bill's had
enough, for a while anyway.
- You better reckon again.

700
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:51,219
Curly'll get you
and Doc Halliday for this...

701
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:54,129
if he has to tear this camp
up by the roots.

702
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:56,633
And I'll be right here to help him.

703
00:57:56,702 --> 00:57:59,671
You talk too much
for a fightin' man, Pringle.

704
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:36,533
Thanks, Doc.

705
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:38,667
Pablo! Pablo!

706
00:58:38,744 --> 00:58:40,837
- Pablo! Pablo! Who done it?
- Somebody help!

707
00:58:40,913 --> 00:58:43,006
- I'll take him.
- I'll kill him!

708
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:46,244
- You don't have to. It's been done.
- Oh!

709
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:48,445
Oh, my! Oh, senor!

710
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,581
- Clear that stuff off of the table!
- Please, senor!

711
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:55,684
Oh, my Pablo!
Oh, senor!

712
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:58,958
Bring some towels, quick!
He's bleedin' bad. Somebody get the doctor.

713
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:02,467
- He won't be back until morning.
- Can't anybody do something?

714
00:59:02,534 --> 00:59:05,765
My Pablo, he die!
Oh, my Pablo!

715
00:59:05,837 --> 00:59:09,238
- Yeah, wait a minute. I know.
- Si, senora. Please, pronto!

716
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:17,606
I'm sorry, Sarah, but...

717
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:23,015
Hey, you, you're needed.
Little Pablo's just been shot.

718
00:59:23,088 --> 00:59:25,181
Come on, come on.

719
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:31,286
Senor, you think he'll be all right?
Huh? Pablito, mijo.!

720
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:38,330
- We all stand here. Anyone
can do nothing for my Pablo.
- Come on, boys.

721
00:59:38,403 --> 00:59:40,496
- He's dying.
- Gangway. Make way.

722
00:59:40,572 --> 00:59:43,200
Say, she's a nurse.
Maybe she can do something.

723
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:51,914
Here, put your fingers there. It'll check
the hemorrhage until the doctor comes.

724
00:59:51,984 --> 00:59:54,885
The doctor's out of town.

725
00:59:54,953 --> 00:59:57,046
Will someone get Dr. Halliday?

726
00:59:57,122 --> 01:00:00,421
- By gosh, Doc is a doctor.
- That's right, but he's all stove up.

727
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:04,394
- Will someone please get Dr. Halliday?
- Yeah. I'll get him for ya.

728
01:00:04,463 --> 01:00:06,988
Make way.

729
01:00:07,065 --> 01:00:09,556
Oh. Come on, Doc.
You're wanted.

730
01:00:11,303 --> 01:00:13,396
Here he is, Doc.

731
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,233
Now let go.

732
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:20,939
Take hold.

733
01:00:21,013 --> 01:00:24,449
- It's a severed artery. There's nothing I can do.
- You've got to do something.

734
01:00:24,516 --> 01:00:27,110
- You can't let the boy die...
- Under the most favorable conditions...

735
01:00:27,185 --> 01:00:29,517
it's a delicate operation,
far beyond me.

736
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:33,251
- What can I do with one arm and no instruments?
- I'll get you some instruments.

737
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:35,418
- Do you know where the doctor lives?
- Yeah.

738
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:38,019
- Take me there quickly.
- Come on.

739
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:41,122
Doc, please, do something for my boy.

740
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:43,793
- My boy!
- Boil some water, lots of it.

741
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:46,429
- Si.
- Get me some basins and a
mirror from the girls' room...

742
01:00:46,505 --> 01:00:48,598
- and all your clean towels.
- Right, Doc.

743
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:00,850
- Doctor not in.
- I know, you big cow. Get out of the way.

744
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:08,888
Quick, it's a matter of life or death.
Where does the doctor keep his instruments?

745
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,656
You know, instruments.
Cuchillos. Things he cuts with.

746
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:16,834
There's nothing here.
Doc's taken everything with him to Bisbee.

747
01:01:16,902 --> 01:01:18,995
- Take this.
- What's the good of all this?

748
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:22,905
- Doc can't do anything with
no instruments, can he?
- I don't know.

749
01:01:22,974 --> 01:01:25,499
- Come on. Get out of the way!
- No get out of way.

750
01:01:25,577 --> 01:01:27,807
- But a little boy... muchacho's dying.
- Come on!

751
01:01:27,879 --> 01:01:30,215
Get out of the way, ya big lug!

752
01:01:30,348 --> 01:01:34,148
All right, now everybody stand back
and give me room, lots of it.

753
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:36,312
Get back, everybody.

754
01:01:41,426 --> 01:01:44,327
- No scalpel.
- No...

755
01:01:44,395 --> 01:01:47,262
- Have you got a razor?
- I got one in the office, Doc.

756
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:49,391
I'll get it.

757
01:01:58,243 --> 01:02:00,336
In there too.

758
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:04,609
All right, Doctor.
You can wash up now.

759
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:06,741
Roll my sleeve up.

760
01:02:10,688 --> 01:02:13,418
Stop shaking and brush
the doctor's hands.

761
01:02:21,566 --> 01:02:23,625
Administer the ether.

762
01:02:28,306 --> 01:02:30,536
Scrub up around my wrist.

763
01:02:41,085 --> 01:02:43,246
Pull the lamp down, Earp.

764
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:48,220
Now take that mirror.

765
01:02:48,293 --> 01:02:51,922
Hold it against the lamp and reflect
all the light you can down here.

766
01:02:53,765 --> 01:02:55,824
Please, Doctor.

767
01:02:57,902 --> 01:03:00,962
Razor, please.

768
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:17,380
Oh, l... Oh.! Dios.

769
01:03:17,455 --> 01:03:19,514
Clamp.

770
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:30,692
New suture.

771
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:41,244
Tie.

772
01:03:41,312 --> 01:03:43,371
Wipe his face.

773
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:50,712
Bandage.

774
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:15,772
- Doctor?
- He's got a chance now... a good chance.

775
01:04:15,847 --> 01:04:20,011
All he needs is quiet and rest.
Better take him home on this table.

776
01:04:20,084 --> 01:04:23,679
- Dr. Dorsen'll tell you what
to do when he gets back.

777
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:27,953
He's going to live.
He says my boy Pablo...

778
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:30,357
he's going to live.

779
01:04:30,428 --> 01:04:32,521
Dry them.

780
01:04:39,737 --> 01:04:42,171
I'm so happy, you know?

781
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,902
Come, John.
You better get some rest.

782
01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:53,714
- John?
- Yes, Sarah?

783
01:04:53,785 --> 01:04:58,654
- Isn't it more thrilling to give
life than to take it away?
- Yes.

784
01:05:05,096 --> 01:05:06,859
Doc!

785
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:18,208
All right, Wyatt Earp.!
I got your friend Doc Halliday, and you're next.!

786
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:22,509
We'll wait for ya
at the O.K. Corral.

787
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:26,380
And we won't wait long.!
Come and make your fight...

788
01:05:26,451 --> 01:05:28,715
or get out of town, pronto!

789
01:05:38,463 --> 01:05:41,921
Doc. Doc!

790
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:45,867
Oh, what have they done?
Oh, they've killed him!

791
01:05:45,937 --> 01:05:47,996
They've killed him!

792
01:05:52,076 --> 01:05:55,910
- Joe, give me my shotgun.
- I'll swear in a posse. We'll wipe 'em out.

793
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,346
No, Henderson.
This is my fight. I'll handle it.

794
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,510
Hold it a second.
Frank, lend me your six-gun.

795
01:06:12,997 --> 01:06:15,488
Sorry you can't come along, Doc.

796
01:06:51,068 --> 01:06:53,434
I'm going to take you
dead or alive, Curly.

797
01:06:53,504 --> 01:06:56,098
You and your friends better
come out and surrender peacefully.

798
01:06:56,173 --> 01:07:00,075
All right, you four-flusher.
If you want me, come and get me.

799
01:07:17,395 --> 01:07:21,957
Well, Mr. Marshal, are you coming in,
or do we have to go out and get you?

800
01:07:22,033 --> 01:07:24,194
Drop that gun, Curly.

801
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:26,361
Come here.

802
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:30,332
Turn around.

803
01:07:30,408 --> 01:07:35,243
I'm gonna try to take you alive
if your friends'll let me. Get going.

804
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:42,084
You men drop your guns
and come out.

805
01:08:28,332 --> 01:08:30,994
I got him for you, Doc!
I got him!

806
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:56,424
The stage is ready to go.
I'll put your baggage aboard.

807
01:08:56,494 --> 01:08:59,361
No, wait.
I've changed my mind. I'm not going.

808
01:09:03,668 --> 01:09:06,432
- You're not going?
- No.

809
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:11,801
You see, John meant a lot to me...

810
01:09:11,876 --> 01:09:14,208
everything.

811
01:09:14,278 --> 01:09:20,183
And just being near where he was
makes me feel I'm still close to him.

812
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:22,310
I understand.

813
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:26,656
- I'll tell 'em you're not going.
- Thank you.

814
01:09:32,263 --> 01:09:36,632
Don't wait for Miss Allen.
She's not going.

815
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:41,934
- Are you leaving town, Jerry?
- Yeah, this dump's getting too tame for me. Look.

816
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:47,807
When people start saving their money,
it's time for me to vamoose.

817
01:09:50,815 --> 01:09:54,273
Well, good-bye, Jerry,
and good luck.

818
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:58,185
Thanks. Well, I guess
you must be all right.

819
01:09:58,255 --> 01:10:02,021
If you wasn't, a great fella like Doc
wouldn't have liked you.

820
01:10:02,093 --> 01:10:04,220
So long.

821
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:07,059
Pull!

822
01:10:26,217 --> 01:10:28,276
Good-bye, Doc.

823
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,403
