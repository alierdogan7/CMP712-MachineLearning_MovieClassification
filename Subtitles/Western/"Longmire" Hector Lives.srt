[Vic] Zachary?

5
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,660
What you doing?

6
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:46,837
- The drawers stick.
- [door opens]

7
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:50,292
- Not for me, they didn't.
- [Walt] Morning, Ruby.

8
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,261
[Vic] Sticky drawers.

9
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:54,387
Okay.

10
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:57,006
- Um, you missed a call.
- Who?

11
00:02:57,682 --> 00:03:00,051
- Ten minutes ago.
- Thanks.

12
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,312
Ruby, who was it?

13
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,348
- Hmm?
- Who was it?

14
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:07,691
None of your business.

15
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:10,853
[cell phone ringing]

16
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,117
This is Deputy Moretti.

17
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:19,036
[Eamonn] Hey. It's good to hear your voice.

18
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:21,372
- What's going on?
- Work.

19
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:24,625
Yeah, me too. Actually, that's,
uh... that's why I'm calling.

20
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:28,463
Looks like your department
put a flag on a Will Balint.

21
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:29,797
Name ring a bell?

22
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:32,508
Yeah, it does. Why? What'd he do?

23
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:34,169
He died.

24
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,515
[Vic] Sheriff Wilkins isn't at the office.

25
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,725
He's already headed to the
Cumberland County morgue.

26
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:43,227
Tell him we'll meet him there.

27
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,929
We'll meet him there.

28
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,434
[Wilkins] So, what brings
you to Cumberland County?

29
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:51,019
This guy.

30
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,154
[Eamonn] I called them, Sheriff.

31
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:55,357
I had to 'cause they never call me.

32
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,859
So, how did he die?

33
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:00,903
Oil-rig accident.

34
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,414
Overhead pipe slid loose from its chain,

35
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,624
struck him on the back of
the head, knocking him out.

36
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,503
Fell face first into some mud, suffocated.

37
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:09,753
How deep was the mud?

38
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,046
Three inches.

39
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:12,340
Seriously?

40
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:16,552
Well, if you're unconscious, that's
plenty deep to block your air passage.

41
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,213
Yeah.

42
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,681
Anyone see this happen?

43
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:21,932
[Wilkins] No.

44
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:25,311
They didn't even find the guy until
one of the next fellas came on shift.

45
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,804
By then, it was too late.

46
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:30,350
What makes you so damn
interested in him, anyway?

47
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:34,445
Will Balint is a suspect
in a recent rape case.

48
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:37,232
Seems suspicious he now shows up dead.

49
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,035
[Wilkins] Well, hell,
he's an oil rigger, Walt.

50
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,871
Newett Energy's actually got a
better safety record than most.

51
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:47,617
But with that drill turning 24/7,
there's bound to be accidents.

52
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,168
Remind me, Jim.

53
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,712
You still owe me a favor, or is it my turn?

54
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:54,965
I lent you Eamonn, so I reckon
the next favor comes from you.

55
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,510
Might have to make it two, then.

56
00:04:57,511 --> 00:05:00,380
Would you mind if I looked
around that oil rig a bit?

57
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,007
It's not your county, Walt.

58
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:04,641
I know that.

59
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:08,770
But if this death is the result of
something that happened in my county,

60
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:11,683
I can't help but feel
some responsibility here.

61
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:15,403
All right. You go take your look.

62
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:19,698
But I'm sending Deputy O'Neill
here along as an escort.

63
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,492
I know how you get, Walt.

64
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:24,912
I don't want you forgetting that
oil company provides a lot of revenue

65
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:27,031
and a lot of jobs in this county.

66
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:30,042
[Walker] Will was a good worker.

67
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,294
Hell, he was better than
good. He was outstanding.

68
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:35,206
That's why I just promoted
him to assistant driller.

69
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,925
What was Will's previous position?

70
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,085
Roughneck.

71
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:41,136
Are those the guys whose job it is

72
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:43,722
to physically force young girls
into having sexual intercourse?

73
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:45,015
Those charges were dropped.

74
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:46,892
Or does, uh, "innocent until proven guilty"

75
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,144
only hold true in, uh, Cumberland County?

76
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:52,273
Walker, we're all just
trying to do our jobs here.

77
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:55,568
And our friends from Absaroka, they're
here with Sheriff Wilkins' blessing,

78
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,480
so I need you to be as forthcoming
with them as you were with us.

79
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,490
Of course. My apologies.

80
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,403
Just a little unsettling
to lose one of your own.

81
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:08,531
You know how that is, don't you, Sheriff?

82
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,417
Who found the body?

83
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:12,834
[Walker] Trot Simic.

84
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,211
Trot!

85
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:16,205
Get up here, tell 'em what you know.

86
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:28,517
Uh, I clocked in, and I walked
up here to start my shift.

87
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,103
And I saw, uh, Will laying in the mud.

88
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,473
- Was he dead when you found him?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:39,278
I mean, I tried to clear his airway
and do CPR, you know, just in case,

90
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,239
but, uh, I couldn't remember how
many breaths for each push and...

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,233
There ain't nothing you could do.

92
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:47,077
Don't beat yourself up on this one.

93
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:48,787
Yeah. [clears throat]

94
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:50,831
Where did this accident happen, Trot?

95
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:53,792
Trot found Will right down there,
30-foot pipe right beside him.

96
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:57,630
I don't know if he got hit down there
or if he got knocked off the platform.

97
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:59,632
So you just tossed Will Balint's body aside

98
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,383
so you all could just get back to work?

99
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:04,428
[Walker] Look, everybody knows
what they're getting into here.

100
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:06,472
It's a dangerous job. People get hurt.

101
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,056
That's why it pays what it pays.

102
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:11,185
But if we were to stop production every
time there was an on-site accident,

103
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,269
however sad,

104
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,106
we'd immediately start hemorrhaging
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

105
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:18,184
We'd all be out of a job.

106
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:21,445
Speaking of which, that's
enough gossip, boys!

107
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:22,856
Go on! Get back to work!

108
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,721
[Eamonn] Just so you know, we did
document the scene and take statements

109
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:50,098
before Sheriff Wilkins gave the okay
for production to start back up again.

110
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,184
[Walt] So you think it was an accident?

111
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,511
[Eamonn] I do.

112
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:55,430
Clearly you don't.

113
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,733
What is it? Just the
coincidence of the timing?

114
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:01,026
Walt doesn't believe in coincidence.

115
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,187
There was also the
matter of that promotion.

116
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:04,739
Well, sure.

117
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,282
Guy's new at his job, he's
more likely to make a mistake.

118
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:09,034
Especially if he leapfrogs all the way up

119
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,078
from roughneck to assistant
driller in one day.

120
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,496
Is that weird?

121
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:16,875
Me and Henry spent most of our
20s working rigs up in Prudhoe Bay.

122
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:20,421
All those years, I never saw anybody
get made up from roughneck to A.D.

123
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:22,673
without being a derrickman
for at least a couple years.

124
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:26,294
So, what's so special about Will
Balint to make him the exception?

125
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:33,809
Well, let me take a look at these guys'
work records and performance reviews.

126
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,352
That might explain things.

127
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:36,645
How you gonna manage that?

128
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:39,732
I'll just tell them they can comply
with Cumberland's modest request,

129
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,735
or I'll sic these two
Absaroka hard-asses on them.

130
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,604
[scoffs]

131
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:50,067
[car door closes]

132
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:05,000
Henry?

133
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,337
Hello, Cady.

134
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,555
You look nice.

135
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:13,056
Thank you. You don't.

136
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:14,467
[laughs]

137
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,261
Car trouble.

138
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,606
So, what is the occasion?

139
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:23,900
I'm going to meet a client from one
of the case files that Mathias gave me.

140
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,820
Someone set fire to
Collin Burnside's house,

141
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:28,564
so I'm trying to push the
feds to open an investigation.

142
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:30,866
Knock 'em dead.

143
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,151
Thanks.

144
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:46,089
[Ferg] Wait, so what
happened to Gab's rapist?

145
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,844
He got promoted, and then he got
knocked out in a work-related accident

146
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,762
and suffocated in three inches of mud.

147
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:53,048
Wow.

148
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:55,424
Some coincidence.

149
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:59,645
You think someone was trying
to get revenge for Gab's rape?

150
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:02,397
Well, if there was, we need
to figure out who knew enough

151
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:04,976
to even identify Will Balint as a rapist.

152
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:09,029
There's Gab, of course, her mom, Linda.

153
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,741
Yeah. May Stillwater, Gab's friend Mandy.

154
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:13,860
And us.

155
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,495
You can't take anything for granted, right?

156
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,990
I mean, a badge and a gun
doesn't make you flawless.

157
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,410
- You're right.
- He is?

158
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,127
[Walt] Malachi.

159
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:27,673
His badge didn't keep him from
being a corrupt tribal police chief.

160
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:30,384
Malachi also knew about Gab's rapists

161
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:33,888
after Mathias and I took a look
at the casino security footage.

162
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,264
Walt, you missed two more calls.

163
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,593
[Walt] I'll have to try back later.

164
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:42,062
You know, it's also possible

165
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,148
that this didn't have
anything to do with Gab's rape.

166
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,360
Vic said that Will Balint
was just promoted, right?

167
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:51,906
Maybe one of his co-workers
had a hard time with it.

168
00:10:51,907 --> 00:10:53,816
Professional jealousy, you know?

169
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,278
Brings up hard feelings.

170
00:10:57,954 --> 00:10:59,238
That's true.

171
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:04,877
Vic, I want you to drive back to Oden and
see if you can find, uh, Archer Loftus.

172
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:06,545
Who's Archer Loftus?

173
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:08,380
[Walt] He's a roughneck
I met at the casino.

174
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:11,967
He's a whistle-blower,
uh, conspiracy theorist.

175
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:16,638
If Ferg is right and this is about
internal politics at Newett Energy,

176
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,882
Archer will know about it.

177
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,268
Why do I have to go? It was Ferg's theory.

178
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:22,603
[Walt] Well, if memory serves,

179
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:25,765
you and Eamonn had the best
working relationship of any of us.

180
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:28,817
Zach, Ferg, I want you
two to put together a list

181
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:32,905
of all of Gab's close
family members and friends,

182
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:36,241
anybody that may have been motivated
to see her rapists punished.

183
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,701
[Ferg] On it.

184
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:39,528
How about you?

185
00:11:41,497 --> 00:11:43,916
I think someone needs to talk to Gab.

186
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,619
She deserves to know
that Will Balint is dead.

187
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:00,925
Thanks for coming.

188
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:04,770
Wanted you to be here
when Gab heard the news.

189
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:05,938
[Henry] What news?

190
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:07,807
One of her rapists was killed.

191
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:12,020
[knock on door]

192
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:15,906
[television playing]

193
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:18,818
[Walt] Thank you for talking with us.

194
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,406
Gab, is your mom at work?

195
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,868
She quit last week.

196
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:29,878
What's she doing now?

197
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,874
Taking a vacation somewhere.

198
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,003
She bought this TV before she left.

199
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,932
When's she coming back?

200
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,301
Check the freezer.

201
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:54,270
How many Lean Cuisines?

202
00:12:58,407 --> 00:12:59,483
Six.

203
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:01,819
Six days, then.

204
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:05,531
What do you want?

205
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:09,577
We came to tell you
that Will Balint is dead.

206
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,080
Who's Will Balint?

207
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,167
He's one of the men who raped you.

208
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:23,932
Which one?

209
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,760
The taller one.

210
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:31,682
Okay.

211
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:45,996
Back already.

212
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:47,497
You must have really missed me.

213
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,208
Walt wants me to talk to an
oil worker named Archer Loftus.

214
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,544
- You know him?
- Uh, well, I've heard about him.

215
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:54,337
He's not the most popular guy around here.

216
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,256
Yeah. That'd be you.

217
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,884
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

218
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,135
Vic, come on.

219
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:02,763
Obviously, you're pissed off about
something, something about me.

220
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:06,016
No. No, I am pissed off at
myself 'cause I'm so stupid.

221
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:08,268
- I thought you wanted me to call you.
- I did!

222
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,480
Really? Then who's the girl who answered
the phone when I actually did call?

223
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:13,690
When did you call?

224
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:16,185
Jesus. How many are there?

225
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,855
Maddie.

226
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:22,866
- [sighs]
- Who the hell is Maddie?

227
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:26,161
She's our Ruby, except she's 22
and she's got a huge crush on me.

228
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:28,622
Wow. Have you always suffered
from self-esteem issues?

229
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:32,409
She has told me to my face five times.
Every time she's had more than one beer.

230
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:35,295
What are you two doing back here?

231
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:37,332
Looking for Archer Loftus.

232
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,335
So am I.

233
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:43,087
[door opens]

234
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:46,715
This is Archer's bunk.

235
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,811
Co-worker reported him
missing just after y'all left.

236
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:52,479
When's the last time anyone saw him?

237
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,523
9:21 a.m. That was what
was on his, uh, timecard.

238
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:57,233
Less than an hour into his shift.

239
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:59,194
He ever split like this before?

240
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:02,280
Nope. But it was right after we found Will.

241
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:03,198
It happens.

242
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,033
Guys see death up close and personal,

243
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,994
it brings it home how
dangerous it is out here.

244
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:08,912
They freak out. They go AWOL.

245
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:09,947
Shit.

246
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:14,626
As much as I'd like to stick
around and do your job for you,

247
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:17,705
I'm now two men short, three
hours behind production.

248
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,208
Don't let her take anything.

249
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:30,184
[Eamonn] Archer Loftus takes off
right after they find the body.

250
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,594
What is that now? Three coincidences?

251
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:43,898
So... boots, jeans, a few tools,
nothing too out of the ordinary.

252
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:52,907
Cyrano Caballero. What is that?

253
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,244
A Big Sky matchmaker for lonely hearts.

254
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:00,373
Which is exactly what I need.

255
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,418
What you...

256
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:12,718
[tires screech]

257
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:26,489
What's going on with this?

258
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,858
With what?

259
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,653
You were with me when that
veteran insisted Hector was alive.

260
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:33,655
Now this.

261
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,951
Hector is dead. We both know that.

262
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:39,836
So why does his name keep coming up?

263
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:41,914
Why does it never seem to surprise you?

264
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:47,795
This is what I look
like when I am surprised.

265
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,893
People are telling stories of
Hector coming back seeking revenge.

266
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:58,597
This car, for example,
belonged to Jack Mule Deer.

267
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:04,194
Jack was a drunk with a bad temper
who abandoned his family and sold meth.

268
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:05,528
Was?

269
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:06,905
Somebody kill him?

270
00:17:06,906 --> 00:17:08,531
Jack died last week of a heart attack,

271
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:11,610
but some people choose to believe
that Hector made it happen.

272
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,246
Because out here,

273
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:18,292
a death like that feels like justice,
the kind that Hector used to bring.

274
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:20,744
And so, in many ways, yes.

275
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,630
Hector lives.

276
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,508
As an idea... and a hope.

277
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:31,346
Is it also possible that
somebody's taken up Hector's mantle?

278
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:36,552
If it is, Gab's mother might have
paid them off to kill Gab's rapist.

279
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,555
Anything is possible.

280
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:52,867
[Zachary] So now that we
got names and addresses

281
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:54,619
for most of Gab Langton's family,

282
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,081
should we combine our
lists, figure out a route?

283
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,700
Yep.

284
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:06,374
Okay. Uh, where's, uh, Old Kanaskat Road?

285
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:10,093
It's on the Res. Can't go there.

286
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:11,636
[Zachary] Okay.

287
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:13,221
Uh...

288
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,216
418 Bramble Street?

289
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,851
Nope.

290
00:18:17,852 --> 00:18:19,345
No go.

291
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:26,318
Couldn't we just ask the... the Res
police for... for permission or...

292
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,020
Yeah, good luck with that.

293
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:34,909
Would you rather I started
making more mistakes?

294
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,288
Would that make you feel more
comfortable about yourself?

295
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,998
Or, uh...

296
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:45,128
Or I could just, you know, keep quiet,
let you answer all the questions.

297
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:47,456
[door opens, closes]

298
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:51,960
How you two coming with
that list of Gab's relatives?

299
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,976
That's not a rhetorical question.

300
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:04,765
Uh, Zachary... why don't you go first?

301
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:09,652
Okay, uh, I think we have
a somewhat complete list

302
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,279
of her relatives in the area.

303
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,989
- [Walt] Let's hear them.
- [Zachary] Okay.

304
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,327
Lem Langton, Cordell
Atherton, Emily Strong Oak,

305
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:20,288
- Sam Poteet, Freddie and Janice Lang...
- Wait, wait, wait.

306
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,831
You say Sam Poteet?

307
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:23,875
Yeah. Yeah, why? It says
here he's Gab's father.

308
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:26,878
- Why? You know him?
- Yeah. We know Sam Poteet.

309
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:29,089
And given the kind of business he's in,

310
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,049
just the kind of guy
you ought to get to know.

311
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,293
Why don't you come along?

312
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:34,711
Yeah, yeah.

313
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,221
[door closes]

314
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:47,482
Think child-bearing,
homemaking, lovemaking.

315
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,401
Show me all that in one picture.

316
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:51,694
Well, that is just as
sweet as the day is long.

317
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:53,897
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Yeah.

318
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,824
We're both consenting adults.

319
00:19:56,825 --> 00:20:00,454
Congratulations, but I'm actually looking
for one of your johns... Archer Loftus.

320
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:02,205
I'm not a fan of that term. I run a legal,

321
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:05,375
certified matchmaking service here with
a very highly respectable clientele.

322
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:08,378
You are running an escort service,
and you and I both know it.

323
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,505
- I beg your pardon?
- Archer's contact information.

324
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:11,506
Hand it over.

325
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:12,632
Whoa, whoa.

326
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:15,343
If I granted access to my
clients' personal information,

327
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:17,887
it would be a betrayal of their trust.

328
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,347
- Trust?
- Yes. Hello.

329
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,265
Really?

330
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,976
Do you think that your female
clientele is gonna trust you

331
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:26,146
when they find out that you've been
setting them up with murder suspects?

332
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:27,188
What on earth...

333
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:29,316
Bianca, don't even begin to listen to that.

334
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,943
I-I screen my clientele very carefully.

335
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:35,405
Archer Loftus was recently questioned
in connection with a local murder.

336
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:37,657
A young woman's body was
just found in a duffel bag

337
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,493
with Archer's luggage tag attached to it.

338
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:42,703
Now one of his co-workers has been found
dead, and he is suspiciously missing.

339
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:44,705
Do you really think that
that's the kind of guy

340
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:47,041
that Bianca here wants to be set up with?

341
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,869
Probably not.

342
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:51,796
Fine.

343
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:55,925
If you can provide me
a proper search warrant,

344
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,261
I promise I will not put up a holler.

345
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:02,807
But until then, I am legally obliged
to protect my clientele's... privacy.

346
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:06,478
I do not have time for a search
warrant. I need the information now.

347
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:10,106
You know what you need? You need a
man in your life, is what you need.

348
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:11,392
Excuse me?

349
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:15,236
I couldn't help but notice you
don't wear your wedding band anymore.

350
00:21:15,237 --> 00:21:17,231
I can only guess why that might be.

351
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,994
Okay. You know what, Cyrano Caballero?

352
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,162
You're right.

353
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,706
I need your services. Sign me up.

354
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:27,957
I have standards.

355
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,667
And I have a cousin who works for ICE.

356
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:32,086
- That's Immigration, Customs, and...
- I know what ICE is.

357
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:33,338
Okay.

358
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:37,717
Well, then you would be motivated
to start me a dating profile

359
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:39,386
and send it to Mr. Loftus.

360
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:41,171
[clears throat]

361
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:45,593
[sighs] If you insist.

362
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:51,265
You might want to take off
your little deputy costume.

363
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:57,237
Slip into something a little
more... you know, feminine.

364
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:59,318
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Who's a pretty girl?

365
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:04,695
Well, look what was under
that big bear outfit.

366
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,572
Just give me the shirt.

367
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,866
[Nighthorse] You see, Walt?

368
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:15,456
How civilized this can be, no
warrants, no guns, no threats?

369
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:19,167
I just want to go about
this the right way, so...

370
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:21,677
It must be you...

371
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:23,721
- [Zachary] Zachary.
- Zachary.

372
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:28,385
You have a rather, uh,
calm energy about you.

373
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:31,138
Quite different from your predecessor.

374
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:35,024
That energy must be
rubbing off on your boss.

375
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,435
Have a seat.

376
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:39,896
[sighs, clears throat]

377
00:22:42,824 --> 00:22:44,359
So...

378
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:50,123
You want to go about what the right way?

379
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:53,209
I'd like to speak to Sam Poteet.

380
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,671
Now, I went by his
house, but he's moved out.

381
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:59,215
There's no forwarding address.

382
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:00,716
I know he's done some work for you,

383
00:23:00,717 --> 00:23:05,798
so I wanted to ask your
permission for us to talk to him.

384
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:10,351
I assume he's still working on
the casino hotel construction.

385
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:12,770
Why do you want to talk
to one of my plumbers?

386
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:17,058
Well, I have reason to believe that Sam
Poteet might be involved in a murder.

387
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:20,403
It has nothing to do with your casino.

388
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:21,938
It happened up in Oden.

389
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,609
I see.

390
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:30,538
Well, I appreciate the
show of respect, Walt.

391
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,081
I do.

392
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:33,617
But no.

393
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:38,497
Why are you protecting him, Jacob?

394
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:42,334
He once stole a dead body for you.

395
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:47,673
Is he doing other work for
you? Is he your new mercenary?

396
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:50,551
Is he the new Hector?

397
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:55,222
Oh, I don't know anything
about a new Hector.

398
00:23:56,231 --> 00:24:01,319
No, I'm protecting Sam Poteet because
you have a badge, a gun, and power,

399
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,275
and Sam is a Cheyenne plumber...
with no one else to look out for him.

400
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:10,278
So now you're protecting the powerless.

401
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:13,039
'Cause last week, you were preying on them.

402
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,207
What?

403
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:18,787
You got Malachi and his thugs running a
loan-sharking operation out of the casino.

404
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:23,799
And they rob the people that owe
them money so they can't pay it back.

405
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,463
Well, your calming influence
seems to have worn off.

406
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:31,091
As has my patience.

407
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:33,851
Great to see you.

408
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,436
Thanks for stopping by.

409
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:38,265
Now get the hell out of my home.

410
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,122
[sighs]

411
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:19,855
[footsteps approach]

412
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:21,516
Oh. Oh.

413
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:46,041
[cell phone ringing]

414
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:52,806
[beep]

415
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,599
Hello, Zachary.

416
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,225
It's me.

417
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:58,519
I need you to call the
Cumberland County morgue,

418
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,897
find out if they've done the
autopsy on Will Balint yet.

419
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:03,065
[Ferg] Sure.

420
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:06,110
Uh, looking for anything in particular?

421
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,355
Yep. Missing teeth.

422
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:48,603
[Zachary] So, you were thinking
that Sam Poteet was the new Hector.

423
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:51,322
Mind if I ask who was the old Hector?

424
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:55,368
Well, Hector was a former
boxer who lived on the Res.

425
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:57,871
Whenever the Cheyenne needed justice,

426
00:26:57,872 --> 00:27:00,206
didn't feel they could
get it through legal means,

427
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:03,326
they'd hire Hector to knock some teeth out.

428
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,085
And you?

429
00:27:05,086 --> 00:27:08,665
I thought Hector was a sign
that the system was broken.

430
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:13,253
Which is why I think there may
be a copycat version involved now.

431
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:16,347
He tried to follow the law,

432
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:19,384
but we couldn't get justice
for Gab after her rape.

433
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:24,098
So someone stepped outside of the
law, and one of her rapists is dead.

434
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:27,308
So, where we going now?

435
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:31,939
To the casino, to talk to Sam Poteet.

436
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:39,613
You know, I did try to do
this the right way first.

437
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:28,920
[door opens]

438
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,580
About what you saw earlier...

439
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:33,208
[clears throat]

440
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:37,171
I, uh... I didn't see anything.

441
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:42,600
Uh... yeah.

442
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,927
Neither did I.

443
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,562
Uh, can I get a room for tonight?

444
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,573
Just for yourself, or
are you expecting company?

445
00:28:57,574 --> 00:28:58,775
Just me.

446
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:02,787
I'd like a quiet room,
away from the construction

447
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:05,949
'cause, uh, I'm a light sleeper, so...

448
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:10,044
Well, it looks like they're still
doing construction on the fourth floor,

449
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:12,747
but I can get you into the second floor.

450
00:29:13,757 --> 00:29:18,294
And I'll put you in a king-size
bed in case your luck changes.

451
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:22,883
[elevator bell dings]

452
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:33,977
They're installing plumbing in one
of the luxury suites down the hall.

453
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:36,403
[Walt] Think a wrench like that

454
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:39,699
could loosen up a length of
drill pipe from a derrick chain?

455
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,778
Devon, tell Malachi Sheriff
Longmire is trespassing.

456
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:47,824
Pipe on a derrick chain.

457
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,951
Is that a riddle?

458
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:52,620
I want to talk to you about your daughter.

459
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:54,497
I don't have one.

460
00:29:58,052 --> 00:30:00,011
Okay, bye.

461
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,130
So Gab Langton isn't your daughter?

462
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:07,393
Sorry. I thought we were talking white.

463
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:10,938
In our culture, aunts and uncles
are also mothers and fathers.

464
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:14,191
We all have a responsibility of
taking care of all the children.

465
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,643
So Gab's your niece?

466
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:18,404
No, she's my daughter.

467
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:21,524
Either way, you know what happened to her.

468
00:30:23,284 --> 00:30:24,736
Yeah, I do.

469
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:27,413
And I also know the white men who raped her

470
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:29,665
went unpunished by the white man's laws.

471
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:34,204
Now one of those rapists just died in
an oil-rig accident in Cumberland County.

472
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:38,458
Now I see.

473
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:42,177
A young Cheyenne woman is
raped. Your hands are tied.

474
00:30:42,178 --> 00:30:44,680
But when a white rapist is
killed in another county,

475
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,133
suddenly you're on the warpath.

476
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:52,271
What's any of this have to do with me?

477
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:56,109
I was wondering if Gab's mother
sent you to kill that rapist.

478
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,318
She came into some money.

479
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,815
Maybe she paid for some
justice, Hector-style.

480
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,110
Hector-style?

481
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,288
I don't know what that means.

482
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,208
Well, they say there's a new Hector
working on the Res... and off.

483
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:15,836
And you do have a history of
doing illegal favors for people.

484
00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:16,879
Hector was a Band-Aid.

485
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,582
You can't solve our
problems one tooth at a time.

486
00:31:20,675 --> 00:31:25,588
If we're going to reverse centuries of
genocide, we don't need a strong man.

487
00:31:26,556 --> 00:31:28,383
We need an army.

488
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:32,553
Sam, where were you last night?

489
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:35,140
Sitting behind the moon.

490
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:39,318
Sheriff, if you're so concerned
about protecting these rapists,

491
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,647
you should hire a security detail
for the one who's still alive.

492
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:46,659
Because if our army has
already taken the field,

493
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,071
that asshole's not going to last long.

494
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:55,626
[radio chatter]

495
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:58,788
We've been instructed to remove
you both from the premises.

496
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,043
Mr. Poteet, we apologize
for the interruption.

497
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,062
What's that?

498
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:18,225
That is rent money.

499
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:22,854
I was only supposed to be
here for a night or two, so...

500
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:27,650
Look, I know I'm supposed to say
something like, "I can't accept that."

501
00:32:28,576 --> 00:32:32,163
But frankly, I really
need it, so thank you.

502
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:33,580
What's going on?

503
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:34,991
[Cady] I got a client.

504
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,292
That's a good thing, right?

505
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:41,380
It is, but photocopy costs and
trial fees are starting to add up,

506
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:43,666
and I cannot ask my dad for money.

507
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:50,556
So, speaking of your
dad, um, how's his health?

508
00:32:50,557 --> 00:32:52,175
Why?

509
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:55,019
He's just been getting calls
at the station from a doctor,

510
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,062
and he never calls back,

511
00:32:56,063 --> 00:32:58,856
so I'm just trying to figure out
if it's 'cause he doesn't want to

512
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:01,768
or if he's just caught up
in the Will Balint case.

513
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,944
Will Balint?

514
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:05,313
Gab's rapist?

515
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:06,940
You don't know?

516
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:11,202
Uh, he was found dead
over in Cumberland County.

517

Tonight? Yeah, no, of
course. Yeah, that sounds fun.

[chuckles] Who was that?

536
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:05,214
That was a guy named Archer Loftus.
He's one of our murder suspects.

537
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:07,125
And I got a date with him.

542
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:34,361
Unfortunately, Sheriff Wilkins has
ruled Will Balint's death an accident.

543
00:34:37,372 --> 00:34:38,823
That was quick.

544
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:42,835
[Eamonn] Well, Jim didn't find any
compelling evidence to the contrary.

545
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:45,129
Plus, he was getting
pressure from Newett Energy

546
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,173
to wrap up the investigation.

547
00:34:47,174 --> 00:34:50,384
Newett Energy happen
to be a campaign donor?

548
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:51,551
[Eamonn] They are.

549
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:55,423
And they paid for recent department
vehicle and weapon upgrades.

550
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:01,687
Now, for all we know, this
actually was an accident, but, um...

551
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:02,847
But what?

552
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:06,560
You were right to question that promotion.

553
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,569
I looked at Newett's employee reviews,

554
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,739
and Will Balint was completely
unqualified for that position.

555
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,908
The promotion should
have gone to Trot Simic.

556
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,444
The guy who found the body?

557
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,706
Archer Loftus have
anything to say about that?

558
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:23,125
Well, not yet. We can't find him.

not answering her phone.

on her new home number?

I'm sure she'd be glad to hear from you.

Thanks.

news, but figured you should know.

- Yeah.

Oh, uh, Ferg wanted to know if
Will Balint was missing a tooth.

He was.

569

Must have got knocked out when he fell.

Why?

For justice.

Then why is one of those... men still
walking around like nothing even happened?

Perhaps you could change this
man's luck from good to bad.

you've got to lock me up in that cell.

691
00:44:26,419 --> 00:44:29,872
And I don't want a Cumberland
County deputy in the room.

692
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,519
Okay.

693
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,639
Thank you.

694
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:54,563
So, I went to work
yesterday. Normal morning.

695
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:58,784
And I hear someone yelling
out in the mud pits for help.

696
00:44:58,785 --> 00:45:03,455
By the time I get there, Trot
Simic is giving Will mouth-to-mouth,

697
00:45:03,456 --> 00:45:06,249
but you could tell it was too late.

698
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,035
He was already dead.

699
00:45:09,462 --> 00:45:13,166
So I kind of freaked out and I left.

700
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,258
Why'd you get so scared?

701
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:19,220
Will Balint came to me last week
and wanted to know where to go

702
00:45:19,221 --> 00:45:22,849
when you don't feel comfortable
talking to your supervisor.

703
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,635
Who's your supervisor?

704
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,347
Walker Browning.

705
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:31,524
What'd you tell Will?

706
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:35,361
[Archer] Well, I told him to speak
to someone in human resources.

707
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:36,905
Next thing I know,

708
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:42,535
he gets made all the way up from
roughneck to assistant driller.

709
00:45:42,536 --> 00:45:45,622
You worked rigs. You know
that just doesn't happen.

710
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:49,284
So I figured, hey, they
must have bought Will off.

711
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:53,039
That is, until he got killed and
I realized what really happened.

712
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:58,252
They set him up in order to silence him.

713
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,840
That's quite a conspiracy.

714
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:07,519
You mean like a pretty blond cop

715
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,897
conspiring to entrap
someone on a dating service?

716
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:13,100
Yeah, I guess it is.

717
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:15,269
Crazy me.

718
00:46:16,779 --> 00:46:20,198
Whatever Will told these
guys got him killed.

719
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:23,869
And for all I know, they
think I know what Will knew,

720
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:27,205
so I got the hell out of there
before they silenced me, too.

721
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:30,166
Who were you afraid
would try to silence you?

722
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:31,209
Walker Browning?

723
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,754
[chuckles] Walker doesn't
get his hands dirty.

724
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:36,498
Who do you think did this, then?

725
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,258
[sighs]

726
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:40,760
I don't know.

727
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:43,923
But Walker takes care of
those who take care of him.

728
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:48,643
Bonuses, promotions.

729
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:51,145
I would be willing to bet, though,

730
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:56,609
that whoever did kill Will is enjoying
a run of stupid good luck right now.

731
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,353
[shouting]

732
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:02,733
Whoo!

733
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:05,827
Whoo!

734
00:47:05,828 --> 00:47:08,072
Here we go, gorgeous!

735
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:12,826
[laughter]

736
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,839
Squeeze on in there. Squeeze on in.

737
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:27,841
Here you go.

738
00:47:37,735 --> 00:47:39,903
No speeding, no drinking.

739
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:41,029
- Understood?
- Gotcha.

740
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,906
Don't stop till you get to the Reservation.

741
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:44,691
- Yes, sir, Mr. Browning.
- All right.

742
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:51,123
Be careful tonight, fellas! These
ladies look awful frisky to me!

743
00:47:51,124 --> 00:47:52,832
[cheering]

744
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,543
[indistinct shouting]

745
00:47:55,544 --> 00:47:57,246
[laughs]

746
00:47:58,255 --> 00:47:59,832
[engine turns over]

747
00:48:05,805 --> 00:48:07,639
Looks like some lucky guys.

748
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,099
I don't know.

749
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,302
Right place at the right time.

750
00:48:13,228 --> 00:48:14,513
That really luck?

751
00:48:16,273 --> 00:48:17,516
I suppose not.

752
00:48:24,907 --> 00:48:29,368
So, putting up that dating
profile to find Archer, he's right.

753
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:31,704
That might be considered entrapment.

754
00:48:31,705 --> 00:48:34,332
Please. He was just thanking me.

755
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:38,162
I have never seen anyone so
excited to get locked up before.

756
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:41,790
He's clearly scared
shitless of Walker Browning.

757
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:44,176
Doesn't trust Eamonn.

758
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:47,470
Maybe he... he just
doesn't trust Eamonn's boss.

759
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:50,473
Apparently, Newett Energy
urged Sheriff Wilkins

760
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:54,144
to rule the death an
accident, which is strange.

761
00:48:54,145 --> 00:48:55,311
Why?

762
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:59,398
Because a workplace accident opens up
the company to a big OSHA investigation,

763
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:03,611
uh, wrongful-death lawsuits, hefty fines.

764
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:07,991
But a simple murder is outside
of the company's liability there.

765
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:09,484
Free and clear.

766
00:49:10,452 --> 00:49:13,121
So why insist on ruling it an accident?

767
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:15,540
Unless you're trying to cover up a murder.

768
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:18,376
Finally got Will Balint's
autopsy to print out.

769
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:20,871
How old is that fax machine, exactly?

770
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:25,175
An autopsy report just made
a two-hour trip in seconds.

771
00:49:25,176 --> 00:49:26,626
That's pretty good.

772
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:29,755
Huh.

773
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:33,384
What is it? Something to
do with that missing tooth?

774
00:49:35,061 --> 00:49:37,888
No. No, it's something else.

775
00:49:39,356 --> 00:49:42,268
Shall we beg you to tell us?

776
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:45,153
Mud.

777
00:49:45,154 --> 00:49:46,404
Great.

778
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:47,906
That clears it up.

779
00:49:47,907 --> 00:49:52,861
There was mud in Will
Balint's esophagus and stomach.

780
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:56,455
Well, that doesn't happen if he suffocated.

781
00:49:56,456 --> 00:49:59,292
No. No, it doesn't.

782
00:49:59,293 --> 00:50:01,794
If he inhaled mud, that
means he was conscious.

783
00:50:01,795 --> 00:50:04,964
So, he had his face in the mud.

784
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:07,717
Someone was pushing him, and
he was trying to fight back.

785
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:10,011
So much for a drilling accident.

786
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:12,430
I also found out who got
promoted after Will died.

787
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:14,933
- Trot Simic.
- [Eamonn] Yep.

788
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:16,809
That sounds like a run of stupid good luck.

789
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:17,894
He also get a bonus?

790
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:20,105
Well, if he did, he's
out spending it right now.

791
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:22,690
Apparently, he went out to
celebrate his promotion tonight,

792
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:25,311
so I'll have to wait for
tomorrow to talk to him.

793
00:50:26,612 --> 00:50:27,646
Maybe not.

794
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:30,990
Think I may know where he's celebrating.

795
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:32,192
Let's go.

796
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:36,238
[upbeat country music playing]

797
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:46,172
Put it away, Heflin.

798
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:48,758
- This one's on me.
- The last one was on you.

799
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:50,176
Well...

800
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:51,378
[sighs]

801
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:53,588
Look, I owe you one.

802
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:58,051
I should, uh, be making
things easier for you...

803
00:50:59,228 --> 00:51:02,272
not making you feel like you
got to tiptoe around my ego.

804
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:05,524
No, no, man, it's... It's... It's cool.

805
00:51:05,525 --> 00:51:08,778
I get it. You guys are like a family.

806
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:10,529
Small, dysfunctional family.

807
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,656
[chuckles]

808
00:51:11,657 --> 00:51:15,986
I know it can't be easy trying to figure
out how to fit someone new in that.

809
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,704
All right, man.

810
00:51:18,705 --> 00:51:20,491
- [cell phone rings]
- Ooh.

812
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,253
Hey, Ruby.

813
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:26,171
Where are you?

814
00:51:26,172 --> 00:51:27,630
[Ferg] Oh, uh, Sheriff.

815
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:30,466
Uh, sorry. I'm at the Red Pony.

816
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:31,877
Been drinking?

817
00:51:33,012 --> 00:51:34,046
A little.

818
00:51:34,888 --> 00:51:36,264
Okay.

819
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:37,883
What... Uh...

820
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:44,223
[cell phone rings]

821
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:49,443
Hello? Yeah.

822
00:51:49,444 --> 00:51:51,737
No, no, just a couple
of non-alcoholic beers.

823
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:54,483
I-I don't actually drink, so...

[clears throat] Casino?

825
00:51:58,287 --> 00:51:59,620
All right.

826
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:01,747
Okay, who... Who am I looking for?

827
00:52:01,748 --> 00:52:03,909
Trot Simic. Okay.

828
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:06,460
All right, I'll be right there.

829
00:52:06,461 --> 00:52:07,662
Sorry, man.

Who needs a beer?

00:52:33,322 --> 00:52:35,690
You want a cigarette,
don't you? There you go.

Here you go.

835
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:40,362
You got one?

[Tyler] Oh, oh.

00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:59,506
My grandma used to tell me the legends
of their mother and her seven pups.

842
00:53:01,392 --> 00:53:04,394
Well, you know, there's a
clearing back in the woods a way.

843
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:07,146
You can see the whole sky from there.

844
00:53:07,147 --> 00:53:12,936
You want to, you know, grab these beers
and go over there, and tell me the story?

845
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:16,106
[chuckles]

846
00:53:19,285 --> 00:53:20,986
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

847
00:53:21,995 --> 00:53:23,322
All right.

848
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:29,919
[Eamonn] Think we're crossing about
five jurisdictional lines right now.

849
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,629
[Vic] You learn to get used to it.

850
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,508
Just focus on taking Trot
Simic into custody if he's here.

851
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:37,794
We'll sort out the details later.

852
00:53:41,056 --> 00:53:44,016
How much further until
we reach the clearing?

853
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:46,637
Well, we're already here.

854
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:50,015
We are?

00:53:52,485 --> 00:53:54,777

This is bullshit.

- You got no authority here.
- Put your hands in the air now.

your big promotion, Trot.

to celebrate with you.

What do you think I'm doing?

867
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:39,272
- [Girl] No! [grunting]
- Hey, hey.

868
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:43,868
[straining]

869
00:54:43,869 --> 00:54:45,738
[grunting]

870
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,709
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

871
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:54,829
I'll get off her. Just
leave me alone, all right?

872
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:57,465
- Scream all you want.
- Oh!

873
00:54:57,466 --> 00:55:00,669
[groaning]

874
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:04,680
No one will care enough to listen.

875
00:55:04,681 --> 00:55:06,349
Ah!

876
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,218
[groaning]

877
00:55:10,479 --> 00:55:14,232
If you ever step foot on this
land again to hurt another woman,

878
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:15,858
I won't just take your teeth.

879
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:17,485
I'll take your life.

880
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:19,312
[grunting]

881
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:25,694
[gunshot]

882
00:55:26,912 --> 00:55:28,392
- Did you hear that?
- Stay here.

883
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:32,867
[Tyler groaning]

884
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:35,669
Gab?

885
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,296
Gab?

886
00:55:37,297 --> 00:55:39,165
We have to run.

887
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:41,759
I'm sure someone heard the gunshot.

888
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,086
We have to run.

889
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:47,348
- Gab!
- [gasps]

890
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:48,425
Run!

891
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:58,852
[gasps]

892
00:56:00,153 --> 00:56:02,113
- Give me the gun.
- [breathing heavily]

893
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:03,816
I-I dropped it back there.

894
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,735
Go!

895
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:21,166
Sheriff's Department!

896
00:56:22,842 --> 00:56:23,877
Stop!

897
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:26,254
Stop or I'll shoot!

898
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:31,968
[gunshot]

899
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:39,811
