00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,663
What's comin' up,
a new gold rush?

164
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:38,067
We never got anything
like that in New Orleans!

165
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:41,595
Maybe so, maybe so,
but it was a heap
more peaceful!

166
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:46,373
I'd like to sink my
chattering teeth in some
good ol' Louisiana oysters!

167
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:50,177
Here, sink your teeth Into this!
Maybe that will stop the chattering!

168
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,412
Oh, it will help!
Thanks!

- Come in!
- They're waitin'
for ya, Frenchy!

170
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,853
The longer they wait,
the better they like it!

is dine with 'em ¶

of wine with 'em ¶

¶ You've got that look ¶

177
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:34,114
¶ That look that
leaves me weak ¶

178
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:38,960
¶ You with your eyes
across the table technique ¶

179
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:42,364
¶ You've got that look ¶

180
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:45,802
¶ That look between the lines ¶

181
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:50,900
¶ You with your let's get
more than friendly designs ¶

00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,741
¶I should be brave and say ¶

183

¶ Let's have no more of it ¶

¶ But oh, what's the use
when you know ¶

185
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:05,617
¶ I love it ¶

186
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:10,628
¶ You'll only kill my will ¶

187
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,664
¶ Before I speak ¶

188
00:14:12,732 --> 00:14:14,757
¶ So turn on
that low left hook ¶

189
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:17,894

206
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,037
Quiet! Shut up!

207
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,442
Folks, an important
announcement by our mayor,

208
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:36,811
the honorable Hiram J! Slade!

209
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,519
Fellow citizens,

210
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:46,490
our esteemed sheriff,
Mr! Joseph Keogh,

211
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,223
has been suddenly
called out of town
on urgent business!

212
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,458
He'll be gone permanent!

213
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:57,491
[Man] Yippee!
So it becomes necessary for
me to appoint somebody!!!

214
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,131
To fill out
the unexpired term!

215
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:05,075
Therefore, with the power
conferred on me!!!

216
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:08,011
By statute number 85-E,

217
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,981
and other statutes
thereunto appertainin',

218
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,315
I do hereby appoint
to the post of sheriff...

219
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:17,447
that paragon of courage,

220
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,549
that credit
to his community,

221
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,561
the pride of Bottleneck,

222
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,723
Mr! Washington Dimsdale!

Hooray for the new sheriff!!

226
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,434
Hooray!

227
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:06,960
What are we cheerin' for?
It's for you, Wash!
You're the new sheriff!

228
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,303
Hooray... What?

229
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,570
That's right, Sheriff!
Congratulations!

230
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:15,546
As mayor of Bottleneck,
I here and now pronounce
you sheriff!

[Cheering]

232
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,743
Drinks on the house,
everybody!

233
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:25,020
I set 'em up
and you drink 'em down!

234
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:28,083
I set 'em up
and you drink 'em down!

235
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:38,764
I set 'em up
and you drink 'em down!

236
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:43,871
This is getting
monotonous!

237
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:46,309
Quiet, everybody!

238
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:49,837
To our new sheriff,
Washington Dimsdale!

239
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,110
A long life!

240
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:56,211
[Cheering]
A long life!
That's pretty good!

241
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:58,882
Wash, aren't you
drinking to yourself?

242
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,119
Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure!

243
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:06,323
Frenchy, am I really
the sheriff?

244
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:10,426
Well, sure, you are!
Then I am off the liquor!

245
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:14,735
A man has gotta choose
between the bottle
and the badge!

246
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,708
[Laughter, Cheering]

247
00:18:19,945 --> 00:18:23,904
Why, he didn't say that...
or did he?

248
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,914
Laugh, you fools!

249
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:33,982
I'm tellin' ya this town
of Bottleneck has gotta
respect law and order,

250
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,152
or I'll put
everybody in jail!

251
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,162
[Laughing]

252
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:44,528
The Sheriff s right!
Now you can see why I chose
such a strong-minded man!

253
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:47,163
[Laughter]
We're all with ya, Sheriff!

254
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,731
If you need any help,
I'll be your deputy!
No need to bother!

255
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,268
I want a deputy like I was
when Destry was my boss!

256
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:59,181
Why, we handled a much
tougher and ornery a crowd
than I see present!

257
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:02,379
Why, when we started shootin',
they ran outta town so fast,

258
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:06,255
the breeze from their coattails
set off a sizeable windmill!

259
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,259
[Laughter]

260
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:11,421
But Destry is dead!
That makes him
the right man for the job!

261
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,864
Saves us
a lot of trouble!
Is that so?

262
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,926
Well, young Tom ain't dead,
and his father brought him up!!!

263
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:21,871
To be the toughest
and fightinest man that
ever growed up in the west!

264
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:26,878
He ain't got as big
a name as his pa,
but he cleaned up Tombstone!

265
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:30,609
And I'm sendin' for him
to be my deputy!

266
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,174
And when he gets here!!!

267
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,243
Destry will ride again!

268
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:37,255
[Laughter]

269
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:05,945
Hey, driver, how many times
do I have to tell you!!!

270
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:09,681
To take it easy
on those bumps?
I got a schedule to keep!

271
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,747
Pull in your neck!
I'll pull a neck in,
but it won't be mine!

272
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:15,089
[Laughing]

273
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,863
You just wait 'til
we get to a stop!

274
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:23,060
[Woman] Oh, Jack,
leave the driver alone.

275
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:26,161
Trip's almost over!
I don't mind the bumps!

276
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:29,639
I do! If he
don't take it easy,
I'll blow his head off!

277
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,199
Please don't mind
my brother, Mr. Destry.

278
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,509
He's always threatening
to blow people's heads off.

279
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:38,812
I had a friend once!
His name was Stubbs!

280
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:43,048
He was always goin' around
threatenin' to blow
people's heads off!

281
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:46,649
One day, a fella came along
and took him up on it!
Well?

282
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:51,219
Well, folks say that
now Stubbs' forehead!!!

283
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:55,324
Is holdin' up
the prettiest tombstone
in Green Lawn Cemetery!

284
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,426
Very funny.

285
00:20:57,503 --> 00:21:00,199
I been handlin' cattle
around these parts
for quite a spell!!!

286
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:02,206
And met some
of the toughest
hombres they got,

287
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,504
and I'm still here.

288
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,704
This ain't no ornament!

289
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,270
Pretty good with it!

290
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:11,373
So was Stubbs!

291
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,680
Meaning just
exactly what?

292
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:17,654
Well, I just mean
you gotta be careful
who you meet up with!

293
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,887
You know, you got some
pretty peculiar ideas
for a deputy sheriff!

294
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,987
- But they make sense!
- Oh, so I'm supposed
to ride!!!

295
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:28,056
In this confounded
contraption gettin'
bumped around like this!!!

296
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:33,036
And grin like a baboon!
Well, maybe you should take up
a hobby, like me!

297
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:36,802
You'd be surprised
the genuine rage
you can work off!!!

298
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,400
Just by carving
a little piece of wood!

299
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:41,503
Are you sure
your name is Destry?

300
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:50,819
Folks is always
askin' me that!

301
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:53,619
Oh, I beg your pardon!

Hey, boss, stage is a-comin'!

306
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,476
How far away?
On the upper ridge.

307
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,644
Oh, doggone it, doggone it!

308
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,654
Come here!

309
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,747
Gimme a hand!

310
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:28,122
Is Destry really comin'?
You're darn tootin' he is,

311
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:30,889
and when he gets here,
there will be a lot
of folks a-goin'!

312
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,954
Come on! Put that
chair in place!

313
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:35,592
Here! There's
a nickel for ya!

314
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:39,297
Jiminy, Wash!
You look like a real sheriff!

315
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:43,000
[Laughs] I ain't
got time to argue!

What you want?
Coach is comin'!
Destry will be here any minute!

319
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,214
I ain't half finished his room yet!
Where's Callahan?

320
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:56,152
- Maybe he's in the saloon!
- Maybe? More than likely!

321
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:58,815
When you see that no-good
Russian lummox, tell him
to get over here!

322
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,189
I'll tell him!
I'll tell him!
Callahan!

Callahan!

324

How much have
you got left?

I tap you, Callahan!
Please, Frenchy!
I am not Callahan!

326
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:13,635
Callahan was my wife's
first husband, and he's dead!

I am Boris Alexanderovich
Stavrogin, and I like to be
called by my name!

All right, Callahan,
what do you do?

He woke up
in the middle of the night
and thought he saw!!!

A great big white hand
comin' up at him over
the edge of the bed!

399
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,216
So he got his gun out
from under his pillow
and he aimed,

400
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,985
and he shot a great big hole
right through his own foot!

401
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,289
No!
Yeah! Now he shouldn't
have gone!!!

402
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,228
By that first impression,
should he? Huh?

Mr! Destry,
before we start drinking,

422
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:44,159
I think you and me ought

Well, I'm all for folks
understanding each other!

That's a mighty
fine idea, Mr! Kent!
I'm glad you agree with me!

00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:52,542
So I'll start by telling you
that I have a...

I always ask him for his gun!

And I ask him real nice!

432
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:14,698
Well, I'm sorry, Mr! Kent!

one gun your collection's
gonna be minus!

Aw, now...
Now wait a minute, lady!

498
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,549
Don't you call me a lady!

499
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,828
Oh... Oh, now, now!

500
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:20,797
Oh, now, you wouldn't...
Come on, Frenchy!

501
00:35:20,865 --> 00:35:23,698
Oh, you must be
plum tuckered out!

502
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,134
My mistake!
Get out before I kill ya!

503
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:28,468
You mean you
haven't been tryin'?
Get out!

504
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,633
All right, all right,
I'm leavin'!

505
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:38,043
You sure have a knack
of makin' a stranger
feel right at home, ma'am!

506
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:44,382
Nice knowin' ya!

00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:50,285

would be the laughingstock

You won't be able
to stick your nose out of a door

Well, them that wants
to hoot, let 'em hoot!
You won't be hearin' it!

520
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:37,106
I told Mrs! Callahan
you won't be needin' this room!

You're leaving
on the next coach!

00:36:39,444 --> 00:36:41,412
I sort of like
it here, Wash!

523
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:45,939
How you gonna face anybody
after what you took
from Kent and Frenchy?

524
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:48,042
What did you expect
me to do?

525
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:53,056
I expected you to be like
your pa; come in a-blastin'
behind shootin' irons!

526
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:57,527
And what happened?
You didn't have any! Why?

527
00:36:57,595 --> 00:37:02,328
- I don't believe in 'em!
- Huh? You did the last
time I heard about ya!

528
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,369
What in thunder's
come over ya since then?

529
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:08,200
Well, Wash...

530
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:11,868
My pa had these on
that day down in Tombstone,

531
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:14,207
but he got shot in the back!

532
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:19,171
Didn't seem to do him
much good, did they?

533
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,514
That's one reason
I don't believe in 'em!

534
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,054
What in tarnation
do ya believe in?

535
00:37:24,122 --> 00:37:26,716
- Law and order!
- Without guns?

536
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,021
Without 'em!

537
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:32,392
Well, if that
don't beat all let go!

538
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:36,222
Oh, Tom!

539
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:40,931
The reason they
made me sheriff here is
because I was the town drunk!

540
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:45,271
They wanted someone they could
kick around, someone who
wouldn't ask questions.

541
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:49,973
But I was aimin' to fool 'em,
do things right,
send in for you!

542
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:53,575
And now!!! You fooled me!

543
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:56,313
Well, you will fool 'em,
Wash!

544
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:59,780
We'll fool 'em together!

545
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:04,021
The only way to do that
is fill 'em full of lead!
No, no!

546
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:06,086
What for?

547
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:09,099
You shoot it out with 'em
and for some reason or
other, I don't know why,

548
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:11,533
they get to look
like heroes!

549
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:14,367
But you put 'em behind
bars and they'll look
little and cheap,

550
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,373
the way they oughta look!

551
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:19,433
And it serves
as a warnin' for the rest
of'em to keep away!

552
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,913
Oh, that won't work
here in Bottleneck!

553
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,973
You go on home,

554
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,508
and I'll go back
to bein' the town drunk!

555
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:32,886
That's all I'm good for!
Now, you're not goin' back
to bein' the town drunk,

556
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:36,449
and I'm gonna stay here and
do this job I come for!

557
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:39,655
My pa did it the old way,
and I'm gonna do it
a new way!

558
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,961
And if I don't prove
to you that I'm right,

559
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,593
I'll get outta town
quick enough! Don't worry!

560
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:47,331
But first, you got
to give me a chance, Wash!
No!

561
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,374
You've got to give me
a chance on this thing!
No, no!

Now, come on! Come on,
swear me in, Sheriff!

Soaked through and through
with the blood
of Sawtooth McGee!

Yeah, he objected to a petticoat
his neighbor's wife was wearing,

589
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,968
and they fit to a draw!
Both buried in the same grave!

590

Sawtooth and the petticoat!
No, Sawtooth and the neighbor
and four innocent bystanders!

to reason or get outta town!

I'll stick around!

postage stamps!

about a postage stamp...

you find out, blast it!

I can account for them,
but you... You've got
to listen to me!

now what's on your mind?

I expect ya to behave!

I'm Eli Whitney Claggett!
Well, glad to know ya!

653
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:17,163
Howdy! Gosh,
I've heard about you
and your pa all my life!

654
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:21,034
Whenever we play
sheriffs and injuns,
I'm always your pa!

655
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:23,039
Couldn't do better, son!

656
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:25,940
Gosh, I bet you've
killed a lot of men
in the course of duty!

657
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,501
Get goin', son!
I'll be right with ya!
How 'bout me handling it?

658
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:31,343
Gosh, yeah,
you can use it!
All right!

659
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:33,383
You see, Tom!
Even that little kid...

660
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,442
Reminds me of a kid
I used to know!

661
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:37,749
He done in both his
ma and pa with a crowbar!

662
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:40,620
No!
Yes, he did.

663
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:43,524
Now the judge said to him,
"Do ya got anything to say
for yourself?"

664
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:46,825
And the kid said,
"Well, I just hope that
Your Honor has some regard!!!

665
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:50,264
For the feelin's
of a poor orphan!"

667
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:58,775
You know, that reminds...
Oh, why don't you go
back to Omaha?

I'm goin' along with you!
What in tarnation for?

Hold your fire, Lem!
Here's Eli back with the law!

673
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:25,736
Say, what do you
think you're doin'?

674
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:28,533
I told you we
were gonna have respect
for law and order,

675
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:31,268
and I ain't makin'
no exceptions!
That's fine, Sheriff!

676
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,742
Get those people
outta my house!
Your house?

677
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,780
That's Claggett's property,
and he ain't gonna sell
to nobody!

678
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,407
Maybe you better
take a look...
I ain't interested!

679
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,179
You mosey on outta here
before I start blastin'!

680
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:44,312
And I mean
every word of it!
Ouch!

681
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:47,619
There was a big bee
about that big right
on the back of your neck!

682
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:49,625
I got him, though!
Thanks!

683
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:51,923
Now look here...
Hold on, hold on!
Just a minute!

684
00:45:51,996 --> 00:45:53,987
Mr! Kent, could I
see that paper?

685
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,861
You wait here while
I talk to Claggett!

686
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:02,371
What do you want
to see Claggett for?

687
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,171
Him's the man I want to put
off this... Who's the sheriff
around here?

688
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:09,474
I tell ya!
You ain't gonna do
this to us, mister!

689
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:13,483
We ain't givin' up
what we worked
ten years to get!

690
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:16,816
Ma'am, I'd sooner
hang that crowd out there
to the nearest tree!!!

691
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:20,084
Than let 'em have
this ranch, but that paper
your husband signed!!!

692
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:22,785
Gives 'em a legal right
to it! Don't it, Wash?

693
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,626
Sure, it does!
The way we're operatin' now!

694
00:46:27,998 --> 00:46:30,489
But I told you what
that woman did to me!

695
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,128
The game was as crooked
as a hog's tail!

696
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:36,105
I don't doubt that,
but it's your word
against theirs!

697
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:38,107
That don't hold up
in court!

698
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:42,271
Why, they'd swear themselves
blue in the face agin' ya!

699
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:46,248
Afraid you folks are
over a barrel!
Fine goin's on,

700
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:48,649
when the law
takes the side of cheats!
Yeah!

701
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,687
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,

702
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:53,348
but that's about all we can do
for you right now!

703
00:46:53,424 --> 00:46:57,326
You folks stick around town!
We'll get this ranch
back for ya!

704
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:00,488

Keogh said,

but we're still a-losin'it.

706

- Keogh?
- Uh, he couldn't do
nothin' about it!

707
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:11,069
Everybody knows that
he left town sudden!

708
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:13,838
Yeah, I'll bet he did!

There! Here's
a present for ya!

711
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:22,481
Wash, you, uh,
stay around here!!!

712
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:25,750
And see that these folks
get their stuff together!
What are you aimin' to do?

713
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:27,688
Get better acquainted
with the enemy!

714
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:30,591
Just don't stick your nose
into a keg of dynamite!

715

'Tain't dynamite!
It's poker and coffee!!!

716

on my mind right now!

No trouble at all, Kent!

Well, thanks, Destry!

I can see you and me
are gonna get along fine!

723
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:54,548
Well, we gotta enforce
the law, don't we?

We sure do! We sure do!

an eye could see!!!

to any action like that!

when he gambled, he won!
I'm sick of Callahan!

832
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,599
I'm sick of hearing his name!
Worse, I'm sick of wearing
his name!

They had the law
on their side!

It's none
of your affair!

Kent's got ahold of
every ranch in the valley!!!

And he wants to charge two bits
for every head of cattle!

is talk,

853

you do what Kent says!

knows what he's a-doin'!

I heard what you just said,
Tyndall.

What are you gonna do about it?
The first thing
we'd better do!!!

Is ask Mrs! Callahan
if she'll take care
of the Claggetts!

Nothin' at present!
That's what I thought!

I'll get somethin' done,
if I have to take the law
in my own hands!

Nobody's gonna set themselves up
above the law around here,

I got somethin'
to say to you!

Maybe I could
illustrate it better
if I told you a story!

870
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:05,138
I used to have a friend
that was an opry singer,

871

but he went into
the cement business!

872

One day,
he fell into the cement!

873
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:13,313
And now he's the cornerstone
of the post office
in St! Louis, Missouri!

874
00:56:13,383 --> 00:56:16,216
He shoulda stuck
to his own trade!

00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:18,254
You'd better stick to yours!

is gonna make trouble,

What are we gonna do?
What do you say

What are my pants
doing on your legs?

884
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:50,619
These are the legs
of a Stavrogin

remain on them

both the curse and the pants!

need the whole menagerie!

What did he come for?
Get to that part quick!

gettin' the kind of cooperation
we should be gettin'!

985
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:25,616
My guess is they just don't
cotton to their sheriffs!

you've been asking around
about Keogh!

01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:10,880
We figured
as long as we had
a sheriff s office,

1028
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:12,888
we might as well
do something!

I'll be back
in just a minute!

01:11:41,377 --> 01:11:45,746
But I'd better call you
Judge now, hadn't I?

1129
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:48,340
I sorta had a feeling
I could count on you!

1130
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:51,818
Anytime, son!
Anytime!
Yeah, all right!

1131
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:54,947
Thanks for the wine,
Kent!
It's all right!

1132
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:58,293
Frenchy!

1133
01:11:58,361 --> 01:12:01,888
Thanks for the, uh!!!
Dance!

1134
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:05,366
Pretty good rabbit!

[Cattle Mooing]

1136
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:21,082
Ready to start bringin'
my cattle through!

1137
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:25,143
- Do I pay you off?
- That's what I'm here for!

1138
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:30,622
How many head you got?
Oh, around 10,000,
I reckon!

1139
01:12:30,693 --> 01:12:34,254
Let's see!
At two bits a head,
that's $2,500!

1140
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:38,266
Yeah! I'll pay you
for the whole bunch right now!

1141

[Gunshot]
[Cattle Mooing]

1142
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,314
I don't care
what the law says!

1143
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:55,509
I brought
those cattle through,
I didn't pay a penny,

1144
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,984
I ain't gonna pay,
and nobody's gonna make me!

1145
01:12:58,054 --> 01:13:01,683
Jack Tyndall, you're
the most stubborn,
ornery, mule-headed...

1146
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:05,693
Self-opinionated's a good word!
Self-opinionated bully
I ever saw or heard of!

1147
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:09,754
Hey, lady, can't you
call him all them names
without bein' so noisy?

1148
01:13:09,832 --> 01:13:13,768
I'm tryin' to sleep!
Gyp, it ain't polite to
interfere with family quarrels!

1149
01:13:13,836 --> 01:13:16,134
Now, go right ahead,
Miss Tyndall!

1150
01:13:16,205 --> 01:13:18,537
It's like talking
to a stone wall!
I give up!

1151
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:20,666
Well, that's too bad!

1152
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:23,405
Sheriffin's getting to be
quite a problem around here!

1153
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:25,913
He won't talk,
he won't listen!

1154
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:29,473
If your brother doesn't pay
that $2,500 he owes to Kent,

1155
01:13:29,552 --> 01:13:32,521
I don't know what's
gonna happen to him!
Nothing's gonna happen to me!

1156
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:34,522
I can take care of myself!

1157
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,581
Lot of things are gonna
happen around this town, though!

1158
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:38,593
You could sue
and recover the money!

1159
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:42,597
Sue Kent
with Slade on the bench?
You must think I'm awful dumb!

1160
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:45,759
- Ain't it the truth!
- I won't pay a plug nickel
now or ever!

1161
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:49,271
All right, I give up!
I give up!

1162
01:13:49,338 --> 01:13:52,102
Miss Tyndall, I want to
thank you for coming here!!!

1163
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:55,234
And tryin' to help out!

1164
01:13:55,311 --> 01:13:58,906
We'll, uh!!! We'll all
be here for quite some time,

1165
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:02,917
so just feel free to
drop over any time at all!

1166
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:05,453
Matter of fact,
I hope you will!
It's here! It's here!

1167
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:08,513
I got it! I got it!
I got the letter...
Oh, excuse me.

1168
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:11,059
In my pocket!
Oh, hello, Miss Tyndall!

1169
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:13,857
Aren't you pretty!
Hello,
Mr! Callahan!

1170
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:15,863
Here's your fodder!

1171
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:17,990
[Gyp]
Cheese. Cheese!

1172
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:20,001
Cheese for breakfast,
cheese for lunch!

1173
01:14:20,069 --> 01:14:23,197
Tell my brother to stop
sending me cheese!

1174
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:25,934
I ain't no mouse!
[Boris]
I tell him.

1175
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:29,444
This may change his mind!
Tyndall!
Yeah?

1176
01:14:31,614 --> 01:14:33,548
Read that!

1177
01:14:35,818 --> 01:14:40,482
Now maybe you can
understand why I want you
to pay Kent the money!

1178
01:14:40,556 --> 01:14:43,423
If you can keep from gettin'
your fool head shot off!!!

1179
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:45,585
Until that judge gets here,

1180
01:14:45,661 --> 01:14:49,097
I can get my murderer
and you can get
your money back!

1181
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:52,423
All right!
I'll go pay him now!

1182
01:14:52,501 --> 01:14:54,560
Well, now we're
gettin' somewhere!

1183
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:58,237
Uh, hold on now!

1184
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:00,537
You might run into
some trouble over there!

1185
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:03,874
We'd better send Boris!
Command me! Nothing can
tempt me from my duty!

1186
01:15:03,946 --> 01:15:05,880
Where are we gonna
pick up the money?

1187
01:15:05,948 --> 01:15:07,882
Wells Fargo!
As soon
as you get the money,

1188
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:10,942
give it to Kent
with Tyndall's compliments,
and get a receipt!

1189
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,750
Yes, mon commandant.
I am a courier,
fast as lightning,

1190
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:15,984
silent as the night
itself!

1191
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:17,992
[Gyp]
And no more cheese.

1192
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:21,629
[Mayor]
According to the provisions
of the statutes...

1193
01:15:21,697 --> 01:15:24,393
of our territorial
commonwealth,

1194
01:15:24,466 --> 01:15:28,630
you have been selected
as representative citizens...

1195
01:15:28,704 --> 01:15:31,400
of our fair community.

1196
01:15:31,473 --> 01:15:35,375
We want to see that
the public's faith
is justified!

1197
01:15:35,444 --> 01:15:39,346
So when you boys retire
to consider a verdict,

1198
01:15:39,415 --> 01:15:41,508
stay out for a while!

1199
01:15:41,584 --> 01:15:44,144
Mr! Kent will see that
you're plentifully provided!!!

1200
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,484
With liquid refreshment!

1201
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:49,388
And after you've
deliberated sufficient,

1202
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:52,450
weighed all the evidence
fair and square,

1203
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:54,996
and brought in a verdict
of not guilty,

1204
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:57,760
you'll be amply rewarded,
y'understand?

1205
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,097
Okay, boss!
We gotcha, Mayor!

1206
01:16:00,169 --> 01:16:02,103
That's all!

[Indistinct Chatter]

1208
01:16:05,174 --> 01:16:07,665
Mr! Kent!
Well,
what do you want?

1209
01:16:07,743 --> 01:16:09,677
Uh, nothing! That is,
I was sent to deliver!!!

1210
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:12,680
$2,500 in cash,
compliments of Mr! Tyndall!

1211
01:16:12,748 --> 01:16:14,682
He's gettin' smart
to himself, huh?

1212
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,684
Mr! Destry had something
to do with this, didn't he?

1213
01:16:16,752 --> 01:16:19,346
I'm a mummy, I'm a sphinx!
I don't answer questions!

[Chuckling]
Let's have the money!
First sign the receipt!

1215
01:16:22,424 --> 01:16:24,892
What?
That is, if you don't mind!
Please?

1216
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,225
Give me that money!
It's a mighty fine thing when
a man realizes he's wrong!!!

1217
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,492
And tries to correct it
in a nice way!

1218
01:16:30,566 --> 01:16:34,127
Give it to him, Kent!

1219

intelligent peace officers
in this town, Stavrogin!

Not like Tyndall
to give in so easy!

1222
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:48,873
Hey, you! You keepin'
my brother comfortable?

1223

He's very delicate!
He's doing as well
as can be expected!

1224
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,355
But he told me to tell you,
no more cheese!
Did he say that?

1225
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:58,359
I'm quoting his every word!
Gee, that's bad if he
don't want no more cheese!

1226
01:16:58,427 --> 01:17:01,692
They're not gonna
hang him, are they?
That is not up to me!

1227
01:17:01,764 --> 01:17:05,598
It's up toJudge Murtaugh!
That's good!

Hey, Mayor,
who is this Judge Murtaugh?

with my brother?

to see him right away!

[Gyp]
I want beer,
but I'll take water.

always get thirsty
when I get to sleep?

I ain't answering nobody
nothin' 'til I see my lawyer!

1240
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:55,473
Do I get the water
or don't I?

Yes, sir!

1247
01:18:11,367 --> 01:18:14,336
Wouldn't want to hang
a sick man!!! Would we?

1248
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,337
You still think
you're gonna hang me?

1249
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:19,101
You think you're
gonna get out of it
because you're innocent?

1250
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:22,632
I ain't sayin' who's innocent
or who's guilty!
Uh-huh!

1251
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:28,650
Well, I always say you got
to admire a man who'd get
himself hanged for a friend!

I used to know a fella once...
You know too many fellas!

this up here!

sit up with that

are gonna tell us a lot!!!

As soon as they find out

on the bench!
