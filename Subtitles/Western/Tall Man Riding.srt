  your stiff-necked pride       

368

       of bringing me           

369
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,559

      with Warbonnet.

those ugly rumors about us.

                 to believe 'em.

    I kept coming here          

375

  any mention of marriage?

When I tried to explain,        

377
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,642
he thought                      
I was just defending you.       

378
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,411
             Well, it worked out
              all right for you.

383

    to take over Warbonnet

859
00:58:58,318 --> 00:58:59,317

860

Thank you, gentlemen.           

861
00:59:00,353 --> 00:59:01,502
Come along, boys.               

862
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:14,081
We're gonna have                
a land rush!                    

863
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:17,685
              Hey, did you hear?

864
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,654
      Warbonnet's public domain!

865
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:58,376
          I told you to hold off
              on the marshal    

866
00:59:58,378 --> 00:59:59,794
        until I had my showdown.

867
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:02,379
Why wait? Look, Larry,          
homestead that quarter section  

868
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,148
where the ranch buildings       
are standing,                   

869
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,518
and you've got the sweetest     
little ranch around.            

870
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,869
You and me                      
could handle it easily.         

871
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:10,137
    I wanted Tuck Ordway's hide,
            not his home.       

872
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,506
                Had I known then
                what I know now,

873
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:12,706
       I'd have never come back.

874
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,742
What do you mean                
"know now"?                     

875
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,477
            Ordway's half-blind.

876
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,879
             He can't see beyond
            the end of his hand.

877
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,649
                  I just came   
               near killing him.

878
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:22,400
Well, isn't that what           
you came back here for?         

879
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:24,819
         Not to shoot it out    
     with an old man half-blind.

880
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,237
You can still hurt him my way   

881
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,239
and do yourself some good       
in the bargain.                 

882
01:00:28,241 --> 01:00:31,509
 Get this straight, Ames, I want
    no part of Warbonnet land.  

883
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:33,812
        As far as I'm concerned,
         the whole game's over. 

884
01:00:33,814 --> 01:00:36,147
        I have one more piece   
    of business to take care of,

885
01:00:36,149 --> 01:00:38,049
             then I'm riding out
                  for good.     

886

You know, you've been making    
an idiot out of yourself        

887
01:00:40,152 --> 01:00:41,686

888
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:13,134
    I thought you had more sense

889
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,603
     than to ride back into town
      with Madden still around. 

890
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:16,905

                   like that.   

893
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,895
How can I forget                
that you're Sebo's girl.        

894
01:01:24,897 --> 01:01:26,464
Ah, but if you were not--       

895
01:01:26,466 --> 01:01:29,184

            with a rattlesnake. 

896

Or perhaps                      
with Señor Madden?              

897

he should be careful.

Someday he's liable

for me instead of a bottle.

     It'll only take me

           Are you sure of this?

911

         She belongs to Sebo.   
     I have no secrets from her.

all about it.

can't see any farther

           his face in town

                 Larry.

          I have to tell you.

          Who did it?

        I've had enough         
            of that.            

982
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,581
         I had my showdown      
           this morning.        

983
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:27,051

984
01:08:27,053 --> 01:08:29,486
          I tried to tell you   
           you couldn't win.    

985
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,091
Who shot you?                   

986
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:36,327
      Was it Pearlo?            

987
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:38,095
      The Peso Kid?             

988

                     Forget him.

989
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,832

01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:45,369
        Forget him, Larry.      

991
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,471
            What I have         
          to tell you is,       

992
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:50,173
            Pearlo knows        
       Tuck Ordway can't see.   

993
01:08:50,575 --> 01:08:51,993
           Who told him?        

994
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,494
                     Luddington.

995
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,196
         They made a deal       

996
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,165
             to swamp

997
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:00,735
          So he tied in         
           with Pearlo.
