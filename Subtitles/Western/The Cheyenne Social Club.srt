1
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,235
Calf on the string.

2
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,369
Calf on the ground.

3
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,571
- Burn him.
- Hot iron.

4
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,586
Pull him.

5
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,884
O'Hanlan.

6
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,349
I'll take the iron.

7
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,690
Old man gave me this
to bring to you.

8
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:07,697
He said to tell you, you are the first man
that got a letter for a long time.

9
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,227
He's very proud of you.

10
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:16,541
- Who's it from, John?
- A lawyer. Says on the outside.

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,507
- Reckon you're in some kind of trouble?
- I don't know.

12
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,705
I don't know, Harley.
Sure has followed me all over Texas.

13
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:27,046
All right, you chuckwallers,
come and bury it!

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,949
Lookie here.

15
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,614
Look, that spread we worked out
of Del Rio last fall.

16
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,250
You remember that spread,
don't you, Harley?

17
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,865
Seems I recollect that's where I didn't
have a good hold on the jerk line.

18
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,330
Yeah, that's right.

19
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:45,198
You sure was hell with the hide off
down there in Del Rio, Harley.

20
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,501
I told you before, though, John, I never
knowed she was the headman's daughter.

21
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:50,938
Ain't you gonna open it?

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,241
I'm not opening any letter from a lawyer
on an empty stomach.

23
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,420
I've eaten a lot of good food in my life,
but this weren't part of it.

24
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,857
I heard no complaints
from none of the others.

25
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,121
Yeah, well, they ain't
as well-bred as I am.

26
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,994
All them crumb-castle belly cheaters
are the same.

27
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,136
You name it, and they'll ruin it.

28
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,933
Seems all a man has to do to call himself
a cook is not know anything about it.

29
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,773
It's all part of the same thing.

30
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,004
Sure ain't no life for a man
who appreciates the finer things.

31
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,445
Every year, I tell myself I'll look
for something easier...

32
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,953
...and every spring, I'm right back
at the same old cutting and tying.

33
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,486
I remember when I was about
12 years old, my daddy asked me...

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,094
...he says, "What do you wanna
be when you grow up?"

35
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,596
A damn fool, I said, "A cowboy."

36
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,899
Been making wrong moves ever since.

37
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,596
If I ever get to be a daddy,
I'm gonna tell the little runt...

38
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,099
- Hey, where you going?
- Cheyenne.

39
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,274
Cheyenne? Ain't you gonna give notice
you're quitting?

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,477
I did that when I signed on.

41
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,440
You know, John,
I think maybe next Christmas...

42
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,810
...I’ll ride on over to Arkansas
and see my sister.

43
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,247
She's two years younger than me.

44
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,819
Up and married a Breedlaw.
Sam Breedlaw.

45
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,048
He's a chamber pot and pin drummer.

46
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,819
Used to sell horses
till one of them stepped on him.

47
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,431
Sam Breedlaw's brother Lucius
taught me how to make Indian whiskey.

48
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,862
- You know how to make Indian whiskey?
- No, Harley.

49
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,663
Well, take a barrel of Missouri river water,
a couple of gallons of alcohol...

50
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:36,537
...add some strychnine to make them crazy
and tobacco to make them sick.

51
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,940
The Indian wouldn't figure it was whiskey
unless it made him sick.

52
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,843
Add a few bars of soap
to put a head on it.

53
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,348
Half a pound or so of red pepper
to give it a kick.

54
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:49,545
Put some tumbleweed in,
boil it till it turns brown.

55
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,450
That's Indian whiskey.

56
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,621
Did I ever tell you
how my uncle Charlie got stove up?

57
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,628
- No, Harley.
- His home sat right out in the prairie.

58
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,598
One day, he went into the outhouse
and got caught in the middle of a stampede.

59
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,169
When he went in, he said there
wasn't a cow in sight.

60
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:10,366
A few minutes later,
365 longhorns ran over him.

61
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,077
Broke him up something terrible.

62
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,447
That was 19 years ago,
and he's still constipated.

63
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,551
Then there was my cousin Jim.

64
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,346
Sure was a fine figure of man...

65
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,149
...but he went all to pieces
when he got married.

66
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,385
Got fat, his hair started falling out,
teeth went bad.

67
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,428
Worse looking he got,
Better looking she got.

68
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,997
I mean, she weren't no vampire
or nothing like that.

69
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,828
Leastways nobody can prove it.

70
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,367
But Lord have mercy...

71
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,529
...the worse looking he got,
the better looking she got...

72
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,403
...till there wasn't nothing much
left of him...

73
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:48,104
...and she went off back east somewheres
and took up with a stone mason.

74
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:55,152
I remember one winter it was almost
as cold as this, down south of Arkansas.

75
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,414
Got to be so cold down there
that winter...

76
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,117
...just about every female in the county
come up pregnant in the spring.

77
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,228
All the following summer
and fall...

78
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,957
...the men and boys was praying
for another cold winter.

79
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,863
"Better than feeding the stock,"
some said.

80
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,903
I was riding in with an old boy
named Hank Jamison.

81
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,302
Had 14 brothers and sisters.

82
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,966
She only had three toes
on her left foot.

83
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,112
- I remember one day...
- Harley.

84
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,143
Who only had three toes
on her left foot?

85
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,808
Hank's sister, Cora Bea.
Cora Bea Jamison was her name.

86
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,012
Folks used to pay her
to take her shoe off.

87
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,515
Married a Styles from over
in Hodge County.

88
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,025
They went around trying to find
a woman with something wrong with her...

89
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,992
...and if they could, they'd marry her.

90
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:44,296
Take Helen. She had flame-red hair,
pitch-black eyes, ruby lips and no teeth.

91
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,835
But talk about a body.

92
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,668
She could straddle two horses
at the same time.

93
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,471
And I went with her
until I found out she dipped snuff.

94
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,946
Something awful unfemale about
a snuff-dipper, don't you think so, John?

95
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,086
There was always a kind of a crowd
around the Jamisons' house...

96
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,119
...waiting for Cora Bea to come out.

97
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,847
She's Hank Jamison's sister.

98
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,015
She only got three toes
on her left foot.

99
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:11,357
Harley, I'd like to talk to you,
if you got a minute.

100
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,362
Sure, John.

101
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,226
You've told me that story
about twice now.

102
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:23,239
Once last week, and then once before when
we were about 500 miles south of here.

103
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,368
Do you know where we are now,
Harley?

104
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,715
- Not exactly.
- We're in Wyoming Territory.

105
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,684
I wouldn't mention it, but you've
been talking all the way from Texas.

106
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,152
- I've just been keeping you company, John.
- I appreciate it, Harley.

107
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,021
And I don't mind it too much
for the first 100 miles.

108
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,392
But, Harley, you've been talking
for 1000 miles.

109
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,162
I'm sorry, John.
You should have told me.

110
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,038
How many more days you figure
to Cheyenne?

111
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,338
Two, maybe three.

112
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,846
If I was you, I'd be a mite more anxious
to get there.

113
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,349
Nobody never left me nothing
in his will.

114
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,387
Well, I just can't figure it out, Harley.

115
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,683
I don't like to say this
about my own brother...

116
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:18,422
...but he just never was what you'd call
an outstanding citizen.

117
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,530
Truth is, he... Well, he...

118
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,637
He wasn't worth the sweat on
a water bag, that's what he wasn't.

119
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,796
He'd do anything for money.

120
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,770
Where was it he got killed?

121
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,206
It was someplace in Carolina.

122
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,313
After they burned Georgia.
And that's another thing.

123
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,379
The only reason I can figure he went
in the war is he saw a profit in it.

124
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,984
What kind of business
you figure your brother left you?

125
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,585
Well, the letter don't say.

126
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,485
But that's just like a lawyer.

127
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,995
They don't tell you no more
than it takes to confuse you.

128
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,292
But it's...

129
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:59,768
...something called
the Cheyenne Social Club.

130
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,670
It must be a saloon.

131
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,776
"Jedediah W. Willowby"

132
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,943
- Who's that?
- The lawyer.

133
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,105
You know, Harley...

134
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:16,884
...I kind of always wondered...

135
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,854
...what it would be like
to be a man of property.

136
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,567
Now step right up, folks...

137
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,234
Lookie there.

138
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,903
St. Louis and New Orleans.

139
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,744
You've heard about it.
You've read about it up for years.

140
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,317
You've looked forward to it.

141
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,545
The ancient remedy from Ireland.

142
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,886
The formula of which I smuggled into
this country at great personal risk to myself.

143
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,120
And now, for the first time in Cheyenne...

144
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,657
...Dr. Foy's Blue Nectar.

145
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,829
It cures warts, opens the bowels,
prolongs life.

146
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,098
Now, don't smile, mister.

147
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,935
I have here today
the living proof of what I tell you.

148
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,577
Mr. C.Y. Yancey.

149
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,613
At the tender age of 8, Yancey contracted
the most horrible and incurable disease...

150
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,115
...the name of which I can't mention
to Christian people.

151
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,743
He began taking this potent elixir.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

152
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,255
...Mr. Yancey is 111 years old...

153
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:04,362
...thanks to the preservative and
the health-rendering powers of Blue Nectar.

154
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,545
All right, Harley, let's go.

155
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,179
The good people of New Orleans
stood in line in the rain...

156
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,288
...for the rare opportunity
of paying $ 1...

157
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,788
...for a bottle of this miracle medicine.

158
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,586
Today, I'm going to let it go
for 50 cents.

159
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,562
Fifty cents a bottle, or $3 a case.

160
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,124
Here it is, Harley.

161
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:56,276
- Are you Jedediah W. Willowby?
- No.

162
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,775
I'm Mr. Willowby's assistant.
Can I help you?

163
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,287
- No, I wanna see...
- I'll handle it, Potter.

164
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,786
Yes?

165
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,863
Are you Mr. Jedediah W. Willowby,
the lawyer?

166
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,624
- Yes.
- Well...

167
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,295
...I got this letter from you,
and here I am.

168
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,872
- You're John O'Hanlan?
- D.J. O'Hanlan was my brother. Yes, sir.

169
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,707
Well, how is it you're on...?

170
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,643
How is it you're
only now coming?

171
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,615
I wrote this letter
over two years ago.

172
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,153
Well, I'm not too easy to find,
Mr. Willowby.

173
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,655
Took it that long to catch up with me.

174
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,555
Come in. I'm certainly relieved
you're finally here.

175
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,659
Have a seat, Mr. O'Hanlan.

176
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:50,800
These are the accounts I've kept
since your brother's unfortunate demise.

177
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,235
- Since he was killed, you mean.
- Yes.

178
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,102
Each month, I've taken my fee
out of the business proceeds.

179
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,211
Reluctantly, I might add,
because, frankly, it's not in my line.

180
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,880
What kind of business does it do,
Mr. Willowby?

181
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,810
- It turns a dollar or two.
- No, I mean...

182
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:11,821
Since I've handled the account,
the profits to this date come to $ 1110.05.

183
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,320
- That's mine?
- This is just a statement...

184
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,292
...to show that the account
was turned over to you in order.

185
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,329
Would you sign at the bottom, please?

186
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,571
Well, you're now the sole owner
and proprietor...

187
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,437
...of the Cheyenne Social Club,
Mr. O'Hanlan.

188
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,076
Well, where is it?

189
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,579
Potter, would you take Mr. O'Hanlan
out to the Cheyenne Social Club?

190
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,184
Mr. Willowby,
I'd like to get cleaned up a little...

191
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,115
...before I take over
my brother's business.

192
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,348
You know how it would look
to folks who come in...

193
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,992
Yes, I see what you mean.

194
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:56,233
One thousand one hundred and ten dollars
and five cents.

195
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,632
I must have misjudged my brother.

196
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,671
Harley, this is more money
than I ever...

197
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,207
Do you know what I can do
with this much money?

198
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,305
We passed
some nice-looking saloons.

199
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:11,643
Harley, with this much money, I can...
I can...

200
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,547
I can... What would you do?

201
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,018
If I had that much money
and had a business...

202
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,818
...I guess I'd just live high on the hog
for as long as it lasted.

203
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,788
That's not what a shrewd businessman
would do, Harley.

204
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,390
- You asked me what I'd do.
- That was my first mistake.

205
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,339
Stop it! Move!

206
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,076
Runaway!

207
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,844
Easy, easy.
Give him his head, ma'am.

208
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,426
Just ain't used to that kind of noise,
are you, boy?

209
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,789
Dog-blasted train.

210
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,660
- Tie him up there good, will you?
- Yeah. He's all right now, ma'am.

211
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,326
Why, thank you, sugar.

212
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,870
You hadn't come, that horse
might've been running till the dry season.

213
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,702
I don't know.
Everything takes practice.

214
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,505
Why, honey, you ain't got nothing
going at all for you, have you?

215
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,112
Hope nobody mistakes you for a fence post
and tacks wire to you.

216
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,809
I never been beef plumb to the hocks.

217
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,444
- I eat a good bit, but it burns up fast.
- Well, I'll tell you what you do.

218
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,854
You come to my place, and I'll fill you
to the brim and pack it down.

219
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,185
The best food in Cheyenne.
The Nashville House, right over there.

220
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,389
Yes, ma'am. Nashville House. I'll sure...

221
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,962
That's your boss?

222
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:41,664
No, ma'am. John's a Texas cowboy come
to Cheyenne for neck meat or nothing.

223
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,274
I just rode along
to hang a rattle with him.

224
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,037
Well, now, don't forget, you hear?
The Nashville House.

225
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,544
And ask for Alice.

226
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,708
How do I look?

227
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,287
You sure are pretty.

228
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,415
You know, l... I even feel like
a successful businessman.

229
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,154
You keep yourself neat and well-dressed,
you have the...

230
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:11,301
The respect of your fellow...

231
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,462
It goes along with responsibility.

232
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,336
Harley, why are you with me?

233
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,168
John, I've rode with you
for 10 years now.

234
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,214
- I know that, Harley, but why?
- Why?

235
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,248
Don't you see what I'm trying to get at?

236
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,910
Here you've been with me for 10 years,
and I don't even know why.

237
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,649
- How come you never asked before?
- Don't know.

238
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,259
Never thought of about it until just now.

239
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,486
- Does it worry you?
- No.

240
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,757
No. But, Harley, when I got
that letter from Mr. Willowby...

241
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,528
...and told you I was going to Cheyenne,
you didn't say a word. Not a thing.

242
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,671
You just got on your horse
and come along.

243
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,307
You didn't even ask me
why I was going to Cheyenne...

244
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,603
...till we'd been out on the trail
the best part of a month.

245
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,279
It does worry you, John. I can tell.

246
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,610
Well, if somebody had been riding
with you for 10 years...

247
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,878
...and you didn't know why,
wouldn't you wonder about it?

248
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,453
Well...

249
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,249
- Pardon me, miss.
- Yes?

250
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,018
Could you direct me
to the Cheyenne Social Club?

251
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,922
How dare you.

252
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,561
- What did I say?
- Too much, I reckon.

253
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,670
Hey, where's the Cheyenne Social Club?

254
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,568
Right where it's always been.
Across the tracks.

255
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,006
- Last place you come to.
- Much obliged.

256
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,571
There it is, Harley. There's my business.

257
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,801
It don't look like no saloon I ever seen.

258
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,472
It ain't what you call
"centrally located," is it?

259
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,649
Hello. Welcome
to the Cheyenne Social Club.

260
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,820
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

261
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,287
I ain't seen you two around before.

262
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,027
- Beg your pardon?
- I'm Jenny. Who are you, honey?

263
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,658
Oh, my name's John O'Hanlan,
this here is Harley Sullivan.

264
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,964
I've come up from Texas
to take possession of...

265
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,572
O'Hanlan?

266
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,799
Are you the late D.J.'s brother?

267
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,139
Yes, ma'am, I sure am.
Did you know D. J?

268
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,711
Know him? Why, bless your heart.

269
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,877
I hope to tell you I knew him.
I was his favorite.

270
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,387
Come on in,
I'll introduce you to the other ladies.

271
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,388
Excuse me, which ladies are these?

272
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,924
Why, your ladies, of course.

273
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,422
Oh, now don't you worry
about a thing, honey.

274
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,533
Every single one of us
was handpicked by D.J. personal.

275
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,664
Ladies, guess who's here.

276
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,567
Harley, you don't suppose?

277
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,709
I mean, you don't think this is a?

278
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,943
You don't believe it, do you?

279
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,611
Do I what?

280
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,849
Nothing.

281
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,277
Just an idle thought.

282
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,749
D.J.'s brother?

283
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,344
"Ring for service.
Sara Jean, one ring.

284
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,780
Pauline, two rings.

285
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,614
Opal Ann, three rings.

286
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,619
Carrie Virginia, four rings."

287
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,951
- I can tell you now.
- Tell me what?

288
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,487
That question you didn't ask me
about that idle thought.

289
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,097
You shouldn't stand out here
like poor kin, honey.

290
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,029
Go on into the parlor
and make yourselves to home.

291
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,726
You too, Mr. Sullivan.

292
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,963
Any friend of the late D.J.'s brother
is a friend of ours.

293
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,165
- Miss... Mrs...
- Oh, it's "miss," honey.

294
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:15,803
Well, Miss Jenny, I'm gonna have
to ask you a question right here and now.

295
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,415
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but...

296
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,652
Tall just like D.J.

297
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,622
Ladies, this is the late D.J.'s brother.

298
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,163
- John, ain't it?
- Oh, John. Yes, ma'am.

299
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,864
This is Miss Annie Jo.

300
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,508
John O'Hanlan.
We are so happy to have you here.

301
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,309
Miss Carrie Virginia.

302
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,507
I'm just so delighted.

303
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,021
Miss Pauline.

304
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,317
So nice to make
your acquaintance, Johnny.

305
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,517
Miss Opal Ann.

306
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,556
Charmed, Johnny.

307
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,258
I'm just all breathless. I...

308
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,360
Miss Sara Jean.

309
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,930
You're just gonna love it
here with us, Johnny.

310
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,134
Well, that's your inventory, John.

311
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,872
We're just one big happy family.

312
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,744
I reckon you'll wanna say
a few words to us, honey.

313
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,818
Just to get things started off right.

314
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,322
You know that the late D.J.
was a stickler for organization.

315
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:37,952
Ladies, John has a few words
to say to us.

316
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,693
Well, ladies, I...

317
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,928
It's kind of hard for me
to tell you this...

318
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,733
...but I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding somewhere...

319
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,138
...down along the line.
- That's you, Pauline.

320
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,835
I...

321
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,538
You see, when...

322
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,084
When l... When l...

323
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,553
You see, when I first heard
that my brother...

324
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,558
...the late D.J.,
had remembered me in his will...

325
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:18,198
What l... What I mean is, I got this letter
from a lawyer here in Cheyenne.

326
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:23,099
And all the letter said was that the...

327
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,976
All the letter says is that my brother,
D.J. O'Hanlan, had left me his business...

328
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,810
...here in Cheyenne.

329
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,282
It was a thing called
the Cheyenne Social Club.

330
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,448
- And...
- Sorry.

331
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,549
And it...

332
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,064
It was a thing called
the Cheyenne Social Club.

333
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,791
I thought it was a saloon.

334
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,765
- I thought it was a saloon.
- Six is me.

335
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,065
- Jenny, Jenny.
- Sorry, Johnny.

336
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,609
Things sort of pick up this time of day,
and that sundown bell just keeps a-tinkling.

337
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,874
It's that little old sundown bell that has to
do with everything I been trying to say.

338
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,517
Johnny, why don't you say
your speech at breakfast.

339
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,949
That's the quiet time
at the Cheyenne Social Club.

340
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,522
- Who says I'm gonna be here for breakfast?
- Sure you'll be here.

341
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,750
- This is your home now, honey.
- Home? No...

342
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,826
I want you to understand
one thing, Jenny.

343
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,089
I may not be much,
but my folks were fine, upstanding people.

344
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,359
Johnny, I gotta go.
That's my sweetie just come in on the 6:15.

345
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,127
- Jenny.
- Harvard man.

346
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,834
- You'll sleep in D.J.'s room.
- But...

347
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,941
We kept it just the way he left it.

348
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,840
- Top of the stairs. First door on the left.
- But, Jenny...

349
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:53,095
This place is busier
than a Kansas City stockyard.

350
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,068
- Your brother?
- That's D.J.

351
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,763
- He favors you.
- Only in looks, Harley.

352
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,101
Only in looks.

353
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,659
- You coming?
- Where are you going?

354
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:23,954
Up to my room.

355
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,795
Your room.

356
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,235
- What are you looking at?
- You.

357
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,103
Why?

358
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,376
I don't know.
You look different somehow.

359
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,143
What do you mean, different?

360
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:25,483
John, it's kind of hard for me
to put my finger on.

361
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,285
Well, try, Harley. Use them all.

362
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,890
Well, you just ain't the man today
you was yesterday.

363
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:34,327
Leastways, not from where I stand.

364
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,526
Well, maybe you're not standing
in the right place, Harley.

365
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,975
What do you...? What do you mean,
"I'm not the man today I was yesterday"?

366
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:48,738
Just like you lost yourself when you took
a bath and bought that new suit of clothes.

367
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,111
- Lost myself?
- Ladies and all, running a place like this.

368
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,253
Now you... You can just stop right there.

369
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,211
I'm not running a place like this.

370
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,382
- What you gonna do, John?
- There's nothing else I can do.

371
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,154
I'm gonna have to fire them all.

372
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,062
Tomorrow morning at breakfast.

373
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,949
Where did you get the cigar?

374
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:36,954
Drunk give it to me when he went in.
Said he had a new baby.

375
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,956
You know, worthless
as my late brother was, l...

376
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,796
I just can't understand
how a man can live here and like it.

377
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,531
They don't seem like
such bad ladies, John.

378
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,572
I run more to boarding houses.

379
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,404
Where folks pay their board and room
and that's it.

380
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,141
I'm going down to the Great Plains Saloon
to get a drink of whiskey.

381
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,848
You coming?

382
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,923
Thought you didn't want me with you.

383
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:11,529
I didn't say that.
I just wondered why you are.

384
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:52,369
You know, this is the first time in my life
I've ever been able to walk into a saloon...

385
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,370
...without having to wonder
whether I can afford it.

386
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,601
It's a good feeling.

387
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,310
Barkeep, we'll have two base-burners.

388
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,941
- Did you say two?
- That's right.

389
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:10,645
- Scotland, Ireland or Kentucky?
- Oh, Kentucky.

390
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,920
- New in town?
- The name's O'Hanlan, up from Texas.

391
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,185
Wait a minute.

392
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,195
You D.J. O'Hanlan's brother? The one that's
taking over the Cheyenne Social Club?

393
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:25,029
- Yes, I am, but...
- Well, welcome to Cheyenne, Mr. O'Hanlan.

394
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,670
Whiskey's on the house to you.

395
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,939
- Hey, hey.
- That's mighty nice of you.

396
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,201
Don't mention it.
D.J. drank free here...

397
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,471
...and, well, I got along all right
at his place.

398
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,013
Mae, this here is D.J. O'Hanlan's brother.

399
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,515
I want you to take real good care
of him, you hear?

400
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,084
- Like you did D.J.
- Yes, sir.

401
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,720
All right, boys. Let's move it.

402
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,877
- Why?
- What for?

403
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,957
For D.J. O'Hanlan's brother,
that's what for.

404
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,094
Well, sure.
Glad to meet you, Mr. O'Hanlan.

405
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,853
I'd do anything for D.J.'s brother.

406
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,261
- Let me shake your hand, Mr. O'Hanlan.
- All right, boys. That's all.

407
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,765
- Let me shake your hand.
- Hope to see a lot of you.

408
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,496
- An honor to know you.
- This was D.J.'s favorite table.

409
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,004
From now on,
it'll be permanently reserved for you.

410
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,005
Anything you want, you just ask for it.

411
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:09,542
After we get to know you better,
you won't even have to ask, it'll be there.

412
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,807
How do you like your beefsteak,
Mr. O'Hanlan?

413
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,507
- Beg your pardon?
- Your beefsteak.

414
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,245
D.J. always used to send me out
for a beefsteak for him.

415
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,979
He liked his rare.

416
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,149
Oh, well, well, I'll...

417
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,487
- I'll have mine well-done.
- Well-done. Yes, sir.

418
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,097
Thank you.

419
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,871
You want a beefsteak, Harley?

420
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:42,003
Well, thank you, John,
but I ain't too hungry just now.

421
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,911
I think I'll just muck around town a while
and see what I can see.

422
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,644
- Are you coming back?
- Well, I don't know, John.

423
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:54,520
Popular as you are, it makes me kind of
skittish just to be close to you.

424
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,884
- Mind if I sit down?
- Not at all.

425
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,855
Not at all.

426
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,420
- Here, have a cigar?
- Never use them.

427
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,157
Here you are, Mr. O'Hanlan.

428
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:39,736
Now, anything else you want,
you just give me the look.

429
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,963
Thank you, Mae, thank you.

430
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,179
You know what I don't like about you?

431
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,576
You and them women of yours
think they're better than everybody else.

432
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,687
I was out at that place of yours once.

433
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,518
She insulted me.

434
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,989
That one called Jenny?

435
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,627
The way she acts, you'd think
she was the Queen of England.

436
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,160
She said I smelled bad.

437
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,763
Wouldn't even let me hold her hand
unless I took a bath.

438
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,626
Well, did you?

439
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,972
- Did I what?
- Take a bath.

440
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,541
You must be soft
between the head-handles, mister.

441
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,642
This here territory is
full of women...

442
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:24,509
...you don't have to smell like lilac water
to get next to.

443
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,077
I'll bet that's the dying truth.

444
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,948
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll eat my beefsteak.

445
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:33,119
No, sir.

446
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,782
I don't like you at all.

447
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,487
Hello, Slim.

448
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,928
- I see you found me, huh?
- Couldn't hardly miss you.

449
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,365
Oh, some think I'm fat, maybe,
but it's not so. I'm just well-rounded.

450
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,267
Gives a man something to hang on to
in the rough country.

451
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,876
You might be on the plump side, Alice,
but I think you're kind of pretty.

452
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,103
- Do you really, sugar?
- Sure I do.

453
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,146
Don't go counting on me
for nothing colorful.

454
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,943
I used to be a real cedar-breaker.

455
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:37,816
Now I'm just bringing up the drags,
looking for a gut-warmer and a salt-lick.

456
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,720
I bet if I opened up the gates
you'd come out a-stooping, huh?

457
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,861
Might at that.

458
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:47,496
Well, come on over here to a table,
let me introduce you to some hot grub.

459
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:51,226
Here, honey, you sit right down here
and keep Dr. Foy and Mr. Yancey company.

460
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,996
I'll send some whiskey over
on my way to the kitchen.

461
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,573
- I'm Harley Sullivan.
- Dr. Michael Foy.

462
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,007
My longtime friend, Mr. C.Y. Yancey.

463
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,374
Oh, Mr. Yancey doesn't shake hands.

464
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,073
Germs, you know. Nothing personal.

465
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,774
You staying here in town?

466
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,546
Cheyenne Social Club.

467
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,355
- You mean, you live there?
- Moved in today.

468
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,753
They tell me you need a character reference
to get past the front door of that place.

469
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,194
It's what you might call "high-toney."

470
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,859
All imported stock, so they tell me.

471
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:28,870
The best in the West, so they say.

472
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,438
Hey, Slim.

473
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:44,411
Sink your teeth into this, honey,
and you can ride the high range this winter.

474
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:52,960
Mind if I ask,
why you staring at me?

475
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:54,893
Why is he staring at me?

476
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:59,002
He likes you.
If he didn't like you, he'd leave.

477
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,031
Are you...?

478
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,812
Is he really 111 years old?

479
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,974
He sure is. And he never felt better,
thanks to Blue Nectar.

480
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,145
Mr. Yancey, how many bottles of Blue...?

481
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,826
How many bottles of Blue Nectar
you figure Mr. Yancey drunk in his life.

482
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,190
Oh, 10 or 12,000 bottles or so.

483
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,229
And look how steady his nerves are.

484
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,465
Yeah, they are kind of steady, ain't they?

485
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,173
Need something?

486
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,514
- Anything more, Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Well, I'll tell you, Mae.

487
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:51,053
You just might give me
a little taste of that Irish whiskey now.

488
00:34:56,694 --> 00:35:01,791
Slim, I think you and me could make
the sparks go if we worked at it a little bit.

489
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:06,630
Well, Alice, it makes me proud
that you think so highly of me...

490
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:10,431
...but I wouldn't...
I just wouldn't know where to begin.

491
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,508
Let alone finish.

492
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,406
You said you thought I was pretty.

493
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,037
And I meant it, Alice. I really did.

494
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,446
You mind not?

495
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,492
Will you tell him to stop staring at me?

496
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:34,859
Mr. Sullivan, you're not being
very respectful to an old gentleman.

497
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:39,332
I definitely think
it's time that we parted ways.

498
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:43,998
Let's go, Mr. Yancey.
We have a long day tomorrow.

499
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:49,169
- Mr. Yancey.
- He's drunk.

500
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,351
He ain't drunk.

501
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,786
He's dead.

502
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:09,727
What? Hey, you two, come on.
Go take this man out of here.

503
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,579
Slim, l...
I don't want you to let this upset you.

504
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,651
Alice, I'm plumb out of flint.

505
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:49,769
- How you doing?
- I never felt better glued-together.

506
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,465
What do you say we walk back?

507
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,724
I tell you, Harley,
as soon as the ladies are all gone...

508
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:22,396
...I’m gonna have a business
as solid and as respectable...

509
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,734
...as Bullion's Dry Goods Store.

510
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:45,288
Solid, solid, respectable...

511
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,660
...Republican business.
That's what makes America, Harley.

512
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,526
My folks were Democrats, John.

513
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,692
And look where it got you.

514
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,135
A lifetime on the range,
and sweating in the summer...

515
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,174
...and freezing in the winter,
and sleeping on the ground...

516
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,504
...and fighting the wolves
and the rattlesnakes.

517
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,306
No, no, Harley.

518
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,848
There can't be a finer calling
in the whole world...

519
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,010
...than being a Republican businessman.

520
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:13,782
I don't like to dispute you, John,
but didn't you always vote Democratic?

521
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,860
Well, that was when
I didn't know any better.

522
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,423
Harley...

523
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,034
...I want you to do me a favor.

524
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:30,071
Don't tell anybody here in Cheyenne
I ever voted Democratic.

525
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,573
- You'll do that for me, won't you?
- lf you say so.

526
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,507
- Thank you.
- John.

527
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,146
You don't mind
if I still vote Democratic, do you?

528
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,582
Just so long as you're not seen with me
when you do it. It'd be bad for business.

529
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,703
Oh, rolling stone.

530
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:06,104
Hooray for Cheyenne.
She didn't... No question.

531
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:10,145
- I tell you, Harley, Cheyenne has to be...
- Good night, Johnny.

532
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,407
Oh, good night?

533
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,143
Carrie Virginia.

534
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,646
Good night, Carrie Virginia.

535
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:22,691
I tell you, Cheyenne
has to be the friendliest town...

536
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,157
Johnny.

537
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,796
Oh, good evening, Jenny.

538
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,132
I waited up for you, John...

539
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,499
...because I didn't want you to go to
sleep tonight without knowing how I feel.

540
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,640
It's just...

541
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:41,002
Well, it...
It's so good to have you here.

542
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:46,576
Well, already I feel like
I've knowed you for years and years.

543
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:50,084
And it makes me all warm inside
just knowing you're in the house.

544
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,223
Just across the hall from me.

545
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,630
I hope you feel the same way...

546
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,524
...knowing I'm close by.

547
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:15,609
Yeah, Cheyenne's gotta be
the friendliest town in the West.

548
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,841
Did you ever in your whole life
see anything like it?

549
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,009
Sure ain't. Not even in Texas.

550
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,088
Well...

551
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,420
I always did this for the late D.J.

552
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,185
I was his favorite, you know.

553
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,695
- Thank you?
- Opal Ann.

554
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:41,136
Why, how sweet of you
to remember.

555
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:45,139
You know,
you wouldn't look bad at all, honey...

556
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,176
...if you scrape off some of the topsoil.

557
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,803
- What's this?
- Just what it looks like, Johnny.

558
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:56,316
D.J. always had a glass of warm milk
with a raw egg in it before he went to bed.

559
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,116
Claimed it kept his strength up
and helped his complexion.

560
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,749
It wasn't his complexion I cared about.

561
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:12,861
Well, if I can do anything else for you,
I'm just down the hall.

562
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,062
Third door on the right.

563
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,920
You expecting company?

564
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:37,560
I just wanna look my best in the morning
when I talk to the ladies.

565
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,661
When you tell them
what you gotta say...

566
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,129
...it ain't gonna make no difference
how you look.

567
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,258
And he was bragging about how much
he could drink without feeling it.

568
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:56,031
Well, I said, the only reason he couldn't
feel it was he was numb to begin with.

569
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,135
- Come on, John.
- Good morning, John.

570
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,337
- Good morning, honey.
- Sit here, honey.

571
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,503
Thank you.

572
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:08,675
Your brother, the late D.J., always liked
to have coffee with us in the morning.

573
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,013
- I'll get you some.
- Thank you.

574
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,416
Hi, hi.

575
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,050
I just wanted to tell you ladies what
I didn't get a chance to tell you yesterday.

576
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,162
Why, sure, Johnny. I'll just call Opal Ann.

577
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,491
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

578
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,157
Opal Ann.

579
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,503
Opal Ann.

580
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,332
- What is it?
- Come on in.

581
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,474
Johnny's got something to tell us.

582
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,304
Y'all go on. I'll get the edges.

583
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,183
I'll be thinking about you, Harley.

584
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:47,017
I'll be thinking about you too, Opal Ann.

585
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,593
- Want some sugar, honey?
- No, I'll just take it like it is.

586
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,093
The late D.J. just loved sugar.

587
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,326
- He was quite a man.
- He was, huh?

588
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:01,869
- He sure was.
- He liked the best of everything.

589
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,267
He did...

590
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,174
Hi there.

591
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,311
Well, ladies,
I'd just like to say that...

592
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,347
John, before you say
whatever's on your mind...

593
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,211
...do you mind if I ask you a favor?

594
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,943
Why, of course. What is it?

595
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,111
Do you mind if I take off
for a month or so?

596
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,279
I wanna go back east and visit my boy.

597
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,516
Your boy? You mean, you have a son?

598
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:27,221
Yes. You see, he goes to military school
in Virginia and doing right well.

599
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,059
I ain't seen him in two years.

600
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:32,202
Oh, well, that's perfectly
all right with me.

601
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,893
Let's see. You're?

602
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,404
- Annie Jo.
- Annie Jo. Annie Jo. Yes, that's...

603
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:40,702
Why, the truth is,
it couldn't come at a better time.

604
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,108
Oh, that's so wonderful kind of you.

605
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,649
Because I'm closing the house
until I can decide what to do with it.

606
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,284
What did you say, John?

607
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,396
I said I was closing the house, Jenny.

608
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,764
I'm closing down.

609
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,831
You mean you're throwing us out?

610
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,097
Oh, I wouldn't put it in that way, Jenny.

611
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:13,437
- Well, just how would you put it, honey?
- Listen, this just isn't my line.

612
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,579
So I'm gonna lock the place up
until I can figure out what to do.

613
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,978
I don't know.
I may open a boarding house.

614
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,448
- I don't know yet.
- And what'll happen to us?

615
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,554
You can go somewheres else, can't you?
There must be a million...

616
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:30,353
You're not the late D.J.'s brother.
The late D.J. had a heart.

617
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:35,029
- You...
- Well, you don't have to...

618
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,755
You...

619
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,673
Jenny, will you tell the ladies for me...

620
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,873
...that I didn't mean that they had
to get out right this minute.

621
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,985
I mean, they can have
all the time they want to pack.

622
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,621
That's right big of you, John.

623
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:03,351
- You tell them that for me, will you?
- Why didn't you wait till Christmas Eve?

624
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,050
Harley!

625
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,719
Did you tell them?

626
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,119
I told them.

627
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,157
Well, what they say?

628
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,989
They're not talking to me.

629
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,395
Too blunt, John.

630
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,831
Bluntness is a flaw in a man's character.

631
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:50,440
If a man wants to get somewhere,
he's got to be what they call "diplomatic."

632
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,599
I mean, if a man wants to reach
one of them shady way stations...

633
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:59,409
...along the torturous, spine-busting
road of life, he can't be blunt with folks.

634
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:04,611
John, you're nickel-plated, but you can be
rougher on folks than an Indian haircut.

635
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,485
I'm not saying
you're bored for the hollow horn, but...

636
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:12,128
...sometimes you leave folks
with the taste of gone-bad pooch...

637
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,093
...you know what I mean?

638
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:17,991
I mean, some of the words
I heard you put on folks...

639
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:23,333
...I’m surprised you ain't been brought up
to a stiff rope and a short drop.

640
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,273
Well, is there anything else?

641
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,001
Well...

642
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,839
Yeah, John,
there is one other thing.

643
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,642
I was wondering if you could see
your way clear to loaning me some money.

644
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,779
You don't have to if you don't want to,
but I thought since you got so much...

645
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,616
...you might see your way clear to...

646
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,590
First, you deliver the sermon,
and then you pass the collection plate.

647
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,660
I didn't go for you to take it like that.

648
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,592
How much money do you want, Harley?

649
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,925
Fifteen or $20 ought to do me.

650
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,500
- And what do you need it for?
- Things.

651
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,934
- What kind of things?
- Just... Just things.

652
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,472
You know,
like a drink of whiskey if I wanted...

653
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,338
...or a new shirt or something.

654
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,445
You already have two shirts.

655
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,174
You don't wear but
one at a time unless it's winter.

656
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,513
There you go,
thinking like a Republican again.

657
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:13,816
Yeah, well, you don't bring up politics
while you're borrowing money, Harley.

658
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,891
It ain't seemly.

659
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,160
The ladies don't understand.

660
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,366
They asked me to find out for them.

661
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,005
Find out what, Jenny?

662
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,074
What we did to cause you
to hate us so much.

663
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,007
- Jenny, I don't hate you.
- You don't love us.

664
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,943
- Can't you understand...?
- Why, we took to you right off.

665
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,583
Opal Ann even remarked...

666
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,015
...how you was distinguished-looking
and gallant.

667
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,746
All I'm trying to tell you is...

668
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,653
- Opal Ann said that?
- And handsome.

669
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,122
She say that too?

670
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,524
"Handsome and well-stood-up,"
them was her words.

671
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,687
- I appreciate... Thank you.
- What do you do?

672
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,766
Why, you stay one night,
and you just throw us out.

673
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,335
Why there ain't a lady
in the Cheyenne Social Club...

674
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,734
...that wouldn't do
anything the world for you...

675
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,136
...you being the late D.J.'s brother
and all.

676
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:08,608
But we just loved his heart.
We just loved him to death.

677
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,213
- Jenny...
- Smothered him with affection.

678
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,611
Turned down his bed at night,
polished his boots.

679
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,752
- Don't cry.
- Trimmed his nails.

680
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,750
- Jenny, please.
- Sat up with him when...

681
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,980
Will you stop crying
and listen to me?

682
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,819
Now, some men
are just cut out for one thing...

683
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,291
...and some men
are cut out for something else.

684
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,089
- And my brother...
- D.J.

685
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,199
D.J., he must have been a master
at what he did.

686
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,598
I mean, he must have been a real beauty
at what he did.

687
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,830
But I'm cut from a different bolt of cloth.

688
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,872
Burlap is what you're cut from.

689
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,777
- I was just trying to...
- lf the late D.J. was here...

690
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:44,470
...he'd take care of Pauline.

691
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,012
Now, what's she gonna do with her liver?

692
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,620
- Her liver?
- Poor Pauline.

693
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,863
What about Pauline's liver?

694
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,405
The late D.J. never came into my room
without knocking.

695
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,805
He was a gentleman.

696
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:19,044
I declare...

697
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,046
- Pretty, ain't it?
- I've seen some beds in my time...

698
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:30,182
...but I never... I can't... I just-
I can't find the words to...

699
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,123
It just kind of grabs you, doesn't it?

700
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,594
I had it custom-made. Solid mahogany.

701
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:40,066
Ivory rollers, goose-down mattress
and Swiss springs.

702
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:41,499
What's that?

703
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,772
- Spurs.
- What?

704
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,838
Well, with a bed like this,
you could set up as a museum.

705
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,138
That's what I may be doing,
thanks to you.

706
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:53,248
Well, now, what is all this
about poor Pauline's liver?

707
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,079
Don't know what they call it,
but it's something terrible.

708
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,915
If your brother was alive,
he'd see she got it fixed.

709
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,319
The late D.J. took care of us.

710
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:04,358
Well, how much money does she need
to get her liver fixed?

711
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:07,759
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars for a liver?

712
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,057
That's what the big doctor
in Chicago charges.

713
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,032
He's got all kinds of fancy letters
in the back of his name.

714
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,229
I don't care what he has
in back of his name.

715
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,864
Five hundred dollars? That's more
than you have to pay for a good horse.

716
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,308
I told you you didn't care.

717
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,197
Pauline, l...

718
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,664
I wondered how long
it was gonna take you.

719
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:47,394
I beg your pardon?

720
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,334
I was D.J.'s favorite too.

721
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,031
Well, Pauline,
I've come to give you something.

722
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,234
I'll just bet you have.

723
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:57,812
I've heard it's better to give than receive,
but I'd a lot rather receive.

724
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,245
Yes, you take this.

725
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,818
Pauline, I want you...
I want you to take this.

726
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,579
Just put it on the dresser, honey.

727
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,780
Well, now, Pauline,
you don't understand.

728
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,792
I want you to take it and get on the train
and go to that doctor in Chicago.

729
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,760
You know, that liver doctor
that Jenny told me about?

730
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,628
That doctor with all the letters and things
in back of his name?

731
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,270
Bless your thoughtful heart,
John O'Hanlan.

732
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,770
That's just the nicest thing
anybody's ever done.

733
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,601
Pauline, I don't want to be blunt...

734
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,243
...because bluntness
is a flaw in a man's character.

735
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,902
And, Pauline, you're... You're sick.

736
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:37,376
Yeah.

737
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,086
You don't care what you step on,
do you, Harley?

738
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,523
Are you comfortable, Harley?

739
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,318
Like I've died and went to heaven.

740
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,295
Come on in, John.

741
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,367
Harley, I wanna talk to you.

742
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,299
- What about?
- Business.

743
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,606
Well, does it have to be now?

744
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,537
What do you want me to do,
Harley, make an appointment?

745
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,114
Oh, all right,
don't go getting on your high horse.

746
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:44,144
I'll be back.

747
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,160
What do you want to talk about?

748
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,355
Harley, I don't think they believe
they really have to get out.

749
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,262
I mean, I haven't seen
one of them pack or anything.

750
00:53:58,435 --> 00:53:59,834
Are they talking to you yet?

751
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:04,906
Well, yes, Jenny's talking a little bit.
Pauline, she...

752
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,836
I mean, Pauline's talk...
But that's what bothers me.

753
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,709
I thought it bothered you
when they weren't talking to you.

754
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,817
It did, but now it bothers me
when they do.

755
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,476
Just like when I was married.

756
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,987
That's right, because when they start
talking to you...

757
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,954
I never knew you were married.

758
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,455
John, it ain't something
I like to talk about...

759
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,291
...but I was married once,
and once is enough for any man.

760
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:33,562
You can't smoke, chew, dip, drink,
scratch in the parlor or cuss.

761
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,762
Leave the house,
they ask where you're going.

762
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,531
Come home, they ask where you been.

763
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,699
And right now, with you,
it's just like when I was married.

764
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,469
Well, how is that, Harley?

765
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,773
Well, John,
when a woman's talking to you...

766
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,712
...you can be pretty sure
she thinks she's in control.

767
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:51,684
When she's not talking to you,
you can be pretty certain you're in control.

768
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,449
And you think I'm not in control now?

769
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,114
- Do you?
- I don't know.

770
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,285
I don't know.
Well, what do you think?

771
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,930
John, I don't understand
your problem.

772
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,464
What more could you ask for
than what you got now?

773
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,034
You got money, a fine house,
all them friends.

774
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,831
Here you follow me
all the way up here from Texas...

775
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,065
...and now you can't even
be a little help.

776
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,268
- I'm trying to, John.
- You know what your problem is, Harley?

777
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,846
You just don't understand anything.
Nothing Harley. Just nothing.

778
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:24,715
Somewhere along the way, you just faded
right out of the big picture of life.

779
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,618
John, you just ain't got no right
to talk to me like this.

780
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,884
- You just...
- We've rode together too long.

781
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,858
- All right, go on in there with?
- Opal Ann.

782
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,327
Opal Ann. Go on.

783
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:43,134
You've changed, John.
You really have.

784
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,867
Ever since you come
into fame and fortune.

785
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,676
Good evening.

786
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,660
Hi.

787
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,145
Let me have a drink of whiskey, barkeep.

788
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,049
- Better drink somewhere else, O'Hanlan.
- What are you talking about?

789
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,390
We were doing all right here in Cheyenne
till you showed up.

790
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,959
All I want is a drink of whiskey.
What's the matter?

791
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:42,963
I've heard tell of some mean ones in my life,
but you got them all beat, O'Hanlan.

792
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,328
Yeah, what did those ladies
ever do to you?

793
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:49,165
I bet you'd foreclose
on widowers and orphans, wouldn't you?

794
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:53,002
Well, stranger, I don't see
it's any concern of yours what I do.

795
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,542
I ought to have your butt kicked is what.

796
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:58,647
- And would you like to try it?
- No. Not in here, you don't.

797
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,806
You gonna give me a whiskey,
or ain't you?

798
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,849
Try the Lady of Egypt Saloon, O'Hanlan.

799
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,182
Only, if you're thirsty,
don't tell them who you are.

800
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:10,058
We sure don't need
the likes of him around.

801
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,996
Ought to set up as a preacher
is what he ought to do.

802
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,855
John.

803
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:47,361
- Can I buy you a whiskey?
- That's mighty kind of you, Mr. Willowby.

804
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,294
I was hoping somebody
would offer me a drink before bedtime.

805
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,560
I believe you've met my associate,
Mr. Potter.

806
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,568
- Hello.
- Mr. Clay Carroll, Mr. John O'Hanlan.

807
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:58,468
- How are you, sir?
- The pleasure is mine, Mr. O'Hanlan.

808
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,973
Mr. Carroll is a lace and button drummer.

809
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,113
Occurs to me the two of you
might do some business together.

810
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,510
What kind of business are you in,
Mr. O'Hanlan?

811
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:11,211
Well, the fact is, Mr. Carroll,
I'm not really in business yet. I just...

812
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,378
O'Hanlan is hiding his light
under a bushel.

813
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,956
He owns the Cheyenne Social Club.

814
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,857
So you're that O'Hanlan.

815
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,566
- Is something wrong?
- What...

816
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,725
Mr. Willowby,
will you explain to him that...

817
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:31,602
Not many men would have the guts
to close down a historical monument.

818
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:34,504
What historical monument is that,
Mr. Carroll?

819
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,874
Your Cheyenne Social Club,
that's what historical monument.

820
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,174
The Cheyenne Social Club is a...

821
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,910
It was there when there wasn't
a railroad for 300 miles.

822
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,783
It's withstood prairie fire and Indian attacks.
And the first ounce, O'Hanlan...

823
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,652
...the first ounce of gold
discovered in this territory...

824
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,057
...was spent wisely and well
at the Cheyenne Social Club.

825
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,430
And you...

826
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,761
...you come up here from Texas
and close it down.

827
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:03,765
Well, now, Mr. Carroll, I didn't figure
I was doing anything all that terrible.

828
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,001
The fact is, where I come from, it'd be
considered something of a public service.

829
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:09,573
You don't say.

830
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,180
Yes, sir, I do say.

831
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:16,181
You must come from a part of Texas
that I ain't heard of.

832
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,987
I have a feeling
you mean something by that.

833
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,691
Sure, I mean something.

834
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:29,597
You Texans are just like little birds.

835
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,860
All mouth and full of...

836
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:55,081
Mister, you just drawed on
an inside straight.

837
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:59,217
Gentlemen, now, gentlemen,
we can settle our differences... Not on...

838
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,693
Oh, that was beautiful.

839
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,560
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Hit him! Hit him! Come on!

840
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:06,861
I got a nice place here.

841
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,653
Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan!

842
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,091
If you're looking for Harley,
he's busy right now.

843
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:36,629
- Well, where is he?
- He was with Carrie Virginia a while ago...

844
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,235
...but him and Pauline have
struck up an acquaintance now.

845
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,671
That Harley. He's like a bad outlaw.

846
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,900
- Just keeps moving from place to place.
- Mr. Sullivan.

847
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:48,566
Mr. Sullivan?

848
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,179
Mr. Sullivan!

849
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:52,644
You calling me?

850
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,283
Your friend Mr. O'Hanlan
is in a terrible fight.

851
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:56,611
You don't say.

852
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,448
Yes. It's a terrible thing going on
up at that saloon...

853
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,782
...and he needs help.

854
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:01,946
Why?

855
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,593
He's outnumbered something terrible,
Mr. Sullivan.

856
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,356
- What are the odds?
- Well, it must be five, maybe six to one.

857
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:11,022
And you figure my weight
might make the difference?

858
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,134
Well, you are friends.

859
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:16,135
Mr. Potter, friends should stay
out of one another's business.

860
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,001
John wouldn't appreciate me interfering.

861
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,757
I hear you got John O'Hanlan locked up.

862
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:42,624
- You a friend of his?
- That's right.

863
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,291
- You come up here from Texas with him?
- Sure did.

864
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,061
That was a bad move.

865
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,671
You can have five minutes.

866
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,681
What happened, John?

867
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:06,379
Harley, you'd think
I was closing down the Alamo.

868
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:10,014
Well, I knew from the start
you wasn't gonna have no easy time of it.

869
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:13,754
Folks just don't like it when you start in
attacking public institutions.

870
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:18,162
- John, I just think your trouble...
- Harley, Harley, would you just forget it.

871
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:19,926
Just how... How are the ladies?

872
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,968
Doing real fine, from what I can see.

873
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,572
- Any of them packing yet?
- No sign of it.

874
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:28,302
There must be some way
to get those women out of there.

875
01:02:28,478 --> 01:02:31,276
Would you tell Mr. Willowby
I'd like to talk to him?

876
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:32,971
He's still in the doc's office.

877
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:37,341
- I didn't know he was sick.
- He weren't till you started that fight.

878
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,489
He was met in the face by a piano stool,
so they say.

879
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:43,955
I hear that saloon looks like
it was in the path of a buffalo stampede.

880
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,992
All for a good cause, Harley.

881
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,857
All for Texas.

882
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,932
Three hundred and twelve dollars
and ten cents.

883
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,729
Now if everybody's satisfied,
I think I'll be on my way.

884
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:58,067
Just do me a favor, O'Hanlan,
stay out of my place.

885
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,675
The unfriendliest town
I've ever come across.

886
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:04,006
People insult you
or don't talk to you at all.

887
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,977
Can't get a drink.

888
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:16,251
Mr. Willowby, I wonder
if I could have a little chat with you.

889
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:32,739
Oh, Mr. Willowby, you just look terrible.

890
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:35,104
A piano stool did all that, huh?

891
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:40,406
I heard you got your jaw hurt,
but nobody said anything about that.

892
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:44,417
That's just the worst-looking eye
I have ever seen, Mr. Willowby.

893
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,782
I remember a fellow down in Texas...

894
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:50,517
...he bent down to tie his boot lace
and got kicked right in the face...

895
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,753
...by a 20-year-old mule named Hattie.

896
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,797
Lost every single one of his teeth
right there on the spot.

897
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:01,699
But I believe, if yours
was compared to his, you'd win out.

898
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,605
Well, I know you're a very busy man,
Mr. Willowby...

899
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,765
...so I won't take up
too much of your time.

900
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,774
But, you know, I've always wondered...

901
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,470
...what it would be like
to be a man of property.

902
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:12,909
And now I know.

903
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,310
And it feels good.

904
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:18,783
Why, for the first time in my life,
I feel like I'm really somebody.

905
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,924
You understand what I mean,
Mr. Willowby?

906
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:25,219
By golly, that's a terrible looking eye.

907
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,557
Well, anyway, I suppose you've heard
I'm letting the ladies go.

908
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,665
And what I'm thinking about doing...

909
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:34,098
...is making the Cheyenne Social Club
into a boarding house.

910
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:37,797
You know, with meals and singing
in the parlor on Saturday night.

911
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:42,638
And songs like "The Old Gray Mare"
and "Hanging Out the Linen Clothes."

912
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,872
But my favorite
is "The True Lover's Farewell."

913
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,709
You know that one?

914
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,410
I forget how that goes.

915
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:53,954
That's it. That's my favorite.

916
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,519
As soon as I change over
and all the ladies are gone...

917
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,687
- You can't do it.
- How's that again, Mr. Willowby?

918
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,533
It's the Cheyenne Social Club or nothing.

919
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,462
I don't think I'm following you.

920
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,131
It's the agreement your brother had
with the railroad.

921
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,834
What's the railroad got to do with it?
It's my house.

922
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:21,445
The house is yours, but the house sits
on the railroad right-of-way.

923
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,887
- Mr. Willowby...
- It's simple, O'Hanlan.

924
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:29,991
When the railroad was buying up land for
its right-of-way, your brother sold to them.

925
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,528
Like everybody else, he wanted the railroad
in Cheyenne, but with one provision:

926
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:38,360
That the Cheyenne Social Club
could stay just the way it was...

927
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:40,900
...as long as the girls were there.

928
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,237
Benefited everybody.

929
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:47,672
- And if the girls go?
- The house goes.

930
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,571
Mr. Willowby, are you telling me
that I don't really own it?

931
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:52,975
You own the house.

932
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,049
- As long as...?
- The girls stay.

933
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,913
- And if the girls go?
- The house goes.

934
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,214
The house goes.

935
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,688
Well, it was nice chatting with you,
Mr. Willowby.

936
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:01,444
John. I'm glad you're finally here.

937
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:04,814
- Where is everybody? They all leave?
- Up in Jenny's room.

938
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,784
I sent for the doctor.

939
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,446
Is Jenny sick?

940
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:11,718
She get beat up, John.
Real beat up.

941
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,830
Looks bad. She's...
Well, she's been asking for you.

942
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,771
Oh, honey.

943
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:44,086
You know, something, Johnny?

944
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,287
No, just don't try to talk, Jenny.
The doctor is coming.

945
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,165
All my life, l...

946
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,636
I've liked people.

947
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,737
Even...

948
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,403
Even...

949
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,517
...people nobody else liked.

950
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,207
- I...
- I know.

951
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:13,878
But nobody's got the right to...

952
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:18,152
...do this to another person.

953
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,191
- Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Yes.

954
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,355
I'm Dr. Carter.
I came as soon as I could.

955
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:28,594
- Get her well, doctor.
- I always do my best, Mr. O'Hanlan.

956
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:38,972
I think she'll be all right eventually,
but she's in bad shape.

957
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,412
She has bruises over 40 percent
of her body.

958
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:45,520
Three broken ribs, some sprains
and maybe some kidney damage.

959
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:47,155
It's too early yet to know.

960
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,450
- You just make sure she stays in bed.
- Yes.

961
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,718
I'll examine her in the morning.
Good night.

962
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,259
Good night.

963
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,365
John.

964
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,765
- Who did it to her, Harley?
- Wait a minute, John.

965
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:02,995
Who did it to her?

966
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:05,970
John, you ain't no hand with a gun,
and I ain't neither.

967
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,406
- I wasn't here when it happened.
- What's his name?

968
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,568
Opal Ann says his name
is Corey Bannister.

969
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,714
Did she mention
where he could be found?

970
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:15,179
John, you know
you can't draw worth a penny.

971
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,980
- Where, Harley?
- Great Plains Saloon.

972
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,361
John.

973
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:39,202
John, can't we talk about this
before you go to doing something rash?

974
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:50,141
- What do you want, O'Hanlan?
- The man that beat up one of my...

975
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:52,618
One of my girls.

976
01:09:56,392 --> 01:10:00,158
They tell me his name's Corey Bannister,
and they tell me I can recognize him...

977
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,321
...by a streak of yellow
down his back.

978
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,477
I'm Bannister.

979
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:25,351
- I figured you were.
- Well?

980
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:30,716
Ever hear about what we do down in Texas
to a man that beats up on women?

981
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:32,524
Suppose you tell me.

982
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:36,329
We drag him through cactus.

983
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,164
No cactus around here.

984
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,770
So I noticed.

985
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,216
Just like D.J. would have done.

986
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,930
How you feeling, Jenny?

987
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,093
Honey, just like I've been stomped on
by a bad bull.

988
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:53,537
Well, doc says to get some soup into you,
so that's what we're gonna do.

989
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,004
Did you ever love a woman, Johnny?
I mean, really love her?

990
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,309
Yeah, thought I did once.

991
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:05,210
Come to find out it was indigestion.

992
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:08,550
You won't believe it,
but a man once loved me.

993
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,158
Oh, he was a real good man too.

994
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,222
He went to Oregon.
Was gonna send for me.

995
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,660
Got shot in Portland.

996
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,728
I cried and cried.

997
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:22,899
It was really me I was crying for.

998
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:27,199
When I was young,
I had all sorts of dreams.

999
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:32,647
- Something awful sad about an old dream.
- Yeah, I know.

1000
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,007
When I was a boy
down in the panhandle...

1001
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,711
...that was before I slipped my hobbles,
I was a real star-gazer.

1002
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:45,383
I tell you, Jenny,
I dreamed and I planned big things.

1003
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:48,289
And then I started drifting.

1004
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,621
Been drifting ever since.

1005
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,972
Come on, come on.
Have some more soup.

1006
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,206
- Goodbye, honey.
- See you later, Carrie Virginia.

1007
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,454
- Hey, that for Jenny?
- Sure is.

1008
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,558
- How is she?
- Doing real good.

1009
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:22,130
You're not doing so bad yourself,
are you, honey?

1010
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:47,711
I suppose you've come to see me
about that little thing last night.

1011
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:52,122
That wasn't any little thing you did,
O'Hanlan, that was a Bannister you shot.

1012
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,262
I've been wanting to do it for years.

1013
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,866
- You haven't come to arrest me?
- I come to warn you.

1014
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:01,127
When you kill one Bannister,
500 will come to his funeral.

1015
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:05,730
Oh, you mean, some of his kin
might come here for me, huh?

1016
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:07,603
You can chisel it in granite.

1017
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,641
Well, what am I supposed to do?

1018
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:15,045
My advice to you is to grab onto the tail
of the first horse you see traveling south.

1019
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,380
- Go back to Texas, you mean?
- Still there, ain't it?

1020
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:22,046
Makes no difference to me, but them
Bannisters is meaner than tiger spit.

1021
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,349
Can't I count on any help from you?

1022
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,184
Oh, I have to go to Medicine Bow
for a prisoner.

1023
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:30,765
But whatever you do,
do it like you mean it.

1024
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,358
Well, how much time do I have?

1025
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:37,038
Three days at the most.
They live quite a ways out of town.

1026
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:40,638
But trouble rides a fast horse.

1027
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:49,013
What do you suppose we should do,
Harley?

1028
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,552
What do you mean "we," John?

1029
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,518
You could wait around
and help me out, you know.

1030
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,785
I said it before and I'm saying it again:

1031
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,794
Neither one of us
is any hand with a gun.

1032
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:03,989
I did all right last night, didn't I?

1033
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,157
John, I don't want to hurt your feelings...

1034
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:10,237
...but Corey Bannister is probably
the first man ever killed by a pecan.

1035
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,929
What are you talking about?

1036
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:14,667
John, how much of that inheritance money
you got left?

1037
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,107
A dollar or two,
after I pay the doctor for Jenny.

1038
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,874
Mr. Willowby says you can't open a
boarding house or anything else, didn't he?

1039
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,073
What's your point?

1040
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:25,379
You got exactly what you come
to Cheyenne with. Nothing.

1041
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,112
I still don't get your point.

1042
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,690
There ain't nothing keeping you here.
Come on back to Texas with me.

1043
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,384
What kind of a man
are you anyway, Harley?

1044
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:36,622
You've been riding with me
for 10 years, and I don't even know you.

1045
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:39,995
Do you think for one minute
that my late brother D.J. would go away...

1046
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:43,194
...and leave these ladies
to face the Bannisters?

1047
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,099
Well, do you?

1048
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,178
Well, do you?

1049
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:57,041
I don't reckon he would, John.

1050
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:19,740
It don't make any sense
staying to meet them Bannisters.

1051
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,838
You get hurt that way.

1052
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,470
I don't wanna get hurt.

1053
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:36,220
I ain't yellow, but it don't make any sense
at all in begging for it.

1054
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,026
Old John will probably be
outnumbered 10 to one.

1055
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:41,890
Ten to two don't make it any better.

1056
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:49,401
- You're sure she's gonna be all right?
- Yes, she'll be fine.

1057
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:54,599
But she shouldn't exert herself too soon.

1058
01:16:54,776 --> 01:17:00,009
- You mean get out of bed?
- No, that isn't what I mean. I mean...

1059
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,116
Let me put it this way, Mr. O'Hanlan:

1060
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,310
- She shouldn't receive visitors for a while.
- I get you.

1061
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:08,047
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

1062
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:38,711
Seen your smoke,
smelled your coffee.

1063
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,153
Can you spare a cup?

1064
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,794
Get down and sit, mister.

1065
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,930
I reckon you fellows have a herd
somewheres abouts?

1066
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:58,433
No.

1067
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,802
You wouldn't be coming from Cheyenne,
would you?

1068
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,739
Sure am.

1069
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,582
- You got a name?
- Harley Sullivan, headed for Texas.

1070
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,744
Heard they had a little shooting
in Cheyenne?

1071
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,420
Sure did.

1072
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:15,916
You see it?

1073
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:19,994
- I was there.
- O'Hanlan must be some hand with a gun.

1074
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,460
No, he can't draw at all.

1075
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:23,859
You say he can't?

1076
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:26,796
Makes out all right with a rifle
if he's got lots of time...

1077
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:29,994
...but when it comes to pistols,
well, you can forget it.

1078
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,605
It's plumb pitiful.

1079
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:35,004
Well, it sounds like you know
this O'Hanlan pretty good.

1080
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:37,145
Well, as anybody, I reckon.

1081
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:40,110
I don't understand him,
but I know him.

1082
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,774
You fellows headed for Cheyenne?

1083
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:47,411
If this O'Hanlan is as bad
at drawing as you say he is...

1084
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,955
...how was it he outdrawed Corey?

1085
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,794
Did...?

1086
01:18:57,065 --> 01:19:00,660
- Did you know Corey Bannister?
- I'm his uncle.

1087
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,370
Uncle?

1088
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,210
- And these here fellows, I reckon, are...?
- Cousins.

1089
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:21,519
Thank you for your coffee.

1090
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,158
If you ever come to Texas,
look me up.

1091
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,400
I wouldn't have said it right to his face...

1092
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:45,410
...but wild horses
couldn't drag me to Texas.

1093
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:37,525
All right, mister,
get up against that wall.

1094
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,462
- What did he do to you?
- He didn't...

1095
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,295
I ain't done nothing, Mr. O'Hanlan.

1096
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:44,529
- Tell him, Carrie Virginia.
- Well, then why are you crying?

1097
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,300
- I'm so happy.
- You're happy?

1098
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:49,238
Pete asked me to marry with him.

1099
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:52,039
Nobody has ever asked me
to do that before.

1100
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,779
It's true, Mr. O'Hanlan,
I did ask her.

1101
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:58,579
And before she started crying,
she said I'd have to ask you.

1102
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,148
- Ask me what?
- For her hand.

1103
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,121
I'll talk to him outside.

1104
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:09,991
l... I'm just so proud.

1105
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,699
I know you are, Carrie Virginia.
I know you are.

1106
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,605
- Your name Pete?
- Pete Dodge.

1107
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:21,241
- You love her?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1108
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,343
- Do you go to church?
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:26,344
Every Sunday morning,
right after I leave here.

1110
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:31,182
- Will you promise to take good care of her?
- Sure do my best.

1111
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:32,820
That isn't what I asked you.

1112
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,846
Yes, sir, I promise
to take real good care of her.

1113
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:43,363
All right, Pete, I'll tell Carrie Virginia
you asked me for her hand and I gave it.

1114
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:45,462
Thank you, Mr. O'Hanlan.

1115
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,268
Just where do you think you're going?

1116
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:51,166
- Well, I was gonna go...
- After the wedding, Pete.

1117
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,537
- After?
- After.

1118
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,706
Well, but you don't seem to understand.

1119
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:58,038
- You see, we've been seeing each other...
- After.

1120
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,514
After.

1121
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:46,853
Maybe we should go out there
and give O'Hanlan some help.

1122
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:50,054
No. D.J.'s brother won't need no help.

1123
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:51,459
He might even be insulted.

1124
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:56,093
Oh, well, I'll stay right here, then.
I sure wouldn't want to insult him.

1125
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,744
You sure are something, honey.

1126
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:17,050
Most men, if they knew the Bannisters
were coming, would be fidgety.

1127
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,887
I'm only fidgety
when I'm not certain, Pauline.

1128
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:22,586
This time I'm certain.
I don't stand a chance.

1129
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,527
I never knew a man so modest.

1130
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,099
Johnny, you got enough guts
to fill a smokehouse.

1131
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,565
Bravest bull in the barn.

1132
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:39,245
Fred, Seph,
get out there behind those ties.

1133
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:53,852
When he shows himself,
get him.

1134
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,026
O'Hanlan, come on out!

1135
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:58,495
All right, ladies, everybody upstairs.

1136
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,294
Now, Johnny, don't get yourself killed...

1137
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,041
Keep down, honey, and stay inside.

1138
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:13,847
Stay in your rooms till it's over.

1139
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:22,689
Hey, O'Hanlan, come on out!
We're gonna have us a party.

1140
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,357
I'm sorry, I don't like crowds.

1141
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:29,122
Oh, you'll like us.
We're the Bannisters.

1142
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:32,460
Everybody in this territory
likes the Bannisters.

1143
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:35,102
That's why they seldom kill one of us.

1144
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:38,262
I ain't coming out,
and you ain't coming in.

1145
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,103
And that's the way it's gonna be all day.

1146
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:51,712
All together.

1147
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:06,790
If one of us can get inside,
we've got him.

1148
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,333
Go on.

1149
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,136
What are you doing?
The doctor said...

1150
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:52,109
Honey, after all you've done for me,
the least I can do is load for you.

1151
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:07,848
You in there, boy?

1152
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,453
Call out!

1153
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,195
He's in here.

1154
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:28,198
Jed, you run pretty fast,
don't you, boy?

1155
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:29,604
I make out.

1156
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:32,479
Give your cousin Jed cover.

1157
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:34,876
- Give it all you got, boy.
- I aim to.

1158
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:51,095
- Is that you, Harley?
- It's me, John.

1159
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,162
- You all right?
- Just fine.

1160
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:00,841
Harley?

1161
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:02,836
Harley?

1162
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:06,339
Texas.

1163
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,981
Harley Sullivan.

1164
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,682
Harley Sullivan!

1165
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:23,655
Uncle Charlie!

1166
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,222
I knew you could do it.

1167
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:54,354
Because I'm D.J.'s brother?

1168
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,092
No, honey.

1169
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,132
Because you're you.

1170
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:29,627
Congratulations!

1171
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:32,459
Right this way, gentlemen.
Right this way.

1172
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:35,761
I heard you were coming, so I went ahead
and ordered your beefsteak.

1173
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:37,666
Hey, Mae.

1174
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:41,439
All right, boys, that's enough.

1175
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,577
That's enough, boys.
Thank you. Thank you.

1176
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:46,578
- I'll buy you a drink later.
- Whiskey's on the house.

1177
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:48,340
- Thank you.
- How lovely to see you.

1178
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:51,314
Oh, hello, Mae. Thank you.

1179
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:54,114
- I'll get your steaks right away.
- Thank you.

1180
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,582
Well, I declare...

1181
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:06,162
Harley, why'd you come back?

1182
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:09,030
John, you think I'd really left you?

1183
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:12,331
- You mean, you didn't?
- You ought to know me better than that.

1184
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:14,304
Here you are, gentlemen.

1185
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:16,807
Just the way you like it.

1186
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,110
Where did you go?

1187
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:23,148
What difference does it make?
I was there when you needed me.

1188
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:25,979
You thought I was scared
of getting hurt, didn't you?

1189
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,679
Well, I have to tell you the truth,
Harley, I did.

1190
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:32,553
I did, and I apologize
for misjudging you.

1191
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:37,621
I thought you'd know me better than that,
after all the years we've rode together.

1192
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:40,233
It just goes to prove
you never really know a man...

1193
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,665
...until the chips are down
and you need him most.

1194
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:44,304
I appreciate you helping me out.

1195
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:45,996
I never knowed it before, John...

1196
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:49,337
...but a good gun fight
sure makes a man hungry.

1197
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:50,875
Hi there.

1198
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:55,949
Thought you'd wanna know, Ray Markstone
just rode out of town to get his family.

1199
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:59,245
I expect the town will fill up
with them before the end of the week.

1200
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:03,516
I don't believe I've ever met anybody
by that name, marshal. Who are they?

1201
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:05,454
Blood kin of the Bannisters.

1202
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,428
And they're coming
to see me, are they?

1203
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,068
No, I suppose they're coming
to see both of you.

1204
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:20,666
- Then I think I'll head on back.
- Just a minute, Harley.

1205
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:22,673
How many Markstones are there?

1206
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:26,780
Oh, 60 or 70, I imagine,
up in the Jackson Hole country.

1207
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:30,213
Maybe another 50 or so
here and there around the territory.

1208
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:34,054
Well, I just wanted to warn you
before I leave town.

1209
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:36,417
You won't be here when they come,
marshal?

1210
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:38,081
Oh, I'd like to be, O'Hanlan.

1211
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:43,526
I really would. But I have to ride
to Fort Laramie to identify a prisoner.

1212
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:45,359
Well, good luck.

1213
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:56,838
Busy as he is traveling, it's right decent
of him to take the time to tell us.

1214
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:07,051
It's hard for me
to say this, Mr. Willowby...

1215
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:10,554
...because I have just come
to like the ladies so much...

1216
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:12,716
You know, Jenny and the others.

1217
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:14,919
Nice ladies, all of them.

1218
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:19,362
But this Cheyenne Social Club
just isn't my kind of a thing.

1219
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,264
What with the money lending
and the saloon fights...

1220
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,961
...and the doctoring
and the gun fights.

1221
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:27,699
Let me speak for Cheyenne,
Mr. O'Hanlan.

1222
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:29,137
Cheyenne is grateful.

1223
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:32,006
There's some talk of running you
for mayor next election.

1224
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:37,909
Do you know, that first day
when I left this office...

1225
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:41,452
...I thought all my dreams
had come true.

1226
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:43,613
- Great.
- Yes, sir.

1227
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:48,523
When you're out on the range with nobody
to talk to most of the time but your horse...

1228
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:50,789
...you do a lot of dreaming.

1229
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:53,763
And I dreamed
of being a man of property.

1230
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:59,874
But, you know... You know, Mr. Willowby...
And I didn't realize it then...

1231
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:03,437
...but I have always been
a man of property.

1232
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:06,512
I have my horse.
I have my blanket.

1233
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:08,911
I have the whole West to ride in.

1234
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,517
How could a man own
more than that?

1235
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:14,986
No, I...

1236
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:18,926
Mr. Willowby, I'm a cowboy.

1237
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,186
Always have been.

1238
01:33:21,562 --> 01:33:24,190
And I know now I always will be.

1239
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,195
What are you gonna do?

1240
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,198
Well, me and Harley's going back
to Texas.

1241
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:37,333
And I want you to transfer
the Cheyenne Social Club to Jenny's name.

1242
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:40,374
- Now, Mr. O'Hanlan, are you certain...?
- Yes, sir.

1243
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:45,808
Yes, I want Jenny and all the other ladies
always to have a place they can call home.

1244
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:48,714
Very well. I'll see that it's done.

1245
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:51,653
Thank you, Mr. Willowby.
I appreciate it.

1246
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:03,125
Well, I guess it's time to go out
and say goodbye to the ladies.

1247
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,238
I reckon so.

1248
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:08,000
I don't know what to say
to them, Harley.

1249
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:09,601
What would you say?

1250
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,042
- Goodbye?
- That's all?

1251
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:16,410
You walk in and say goodbye
and walk out?

1252
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:18,346
What's wrong with it?

1253
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:21,750
Well, for one thing, Harley,
it's downright rude.

1254
01:34:21,922 --> 01:34:24,447
And for another thing, it's blunt.

1255
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:27,651
Well, John, you asked me, and I told you.
What else do you want?

1256
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:30,991
Nothing, Harley. Nothing.

1257
01:34:32,133 --> 01:34:36,502
Ladies, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this...

1258
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:40,300
...because I didn't know
it was gonna come to this.

1259
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,533
Oh, there's that bell.

1260
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:43,699
I'm sorry, honey.

1261
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:48,508
- You go right on with what you're saying.
- Well, I haven't said anything yet.

1262
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:53,944
Well, anyways, I had a little chat
with Mr. Willowby, you know...

1263
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:56,519
Sorry, Johnny.

1264
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:01,091
Well, I had this little chat
with Mr. Willowby, the lawyer?

1265
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:04,254
You know?
And what he's gonna do is...

1266
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:12,101
Oh, now, hold on here, Carrie Virginia.
I gave you away.

1267
01:35:12,273 --> 01:35:14,673
I told that fellow Pete Dodge
you could marry him...

1268
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:17,675
...and for him to stay away
until after the wedding, didn't I?

1269
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:20,473
Oh, I know, honey.
And Pete is staying away too.

1270
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:21,979
He is? Well, who is...?

1271
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:24,913
Oh, that's just Edgar,
coming to pay his respects.

1272
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,485
Edgar? Who's Edgar?

1273
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:30,420
Pete's brother.
They're such a close family.

1274
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:34,155
Close?

1275
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,427
Close family?

1276
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,597
What did you want to tell us, honey?

1277
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,768
- What?
- You were saying?

1278
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:51,141
Well, I guess all I really wanted
to say was goodbye.

1279
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:55,041
- Are you going somewhere?
- Well, l...

1280
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,546
That's me.

1281
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:16,025
- We're alone at last.
- What?

1282
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,137
It's the first time
we've ever been alone.

1283
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:21,331
- What's that got to do with it?
- Why, everything, honey.

1284
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:24,478
- Opal Ann, all I wanted to say was...
- I know.

1285
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:27,978
You wanted to say
that I'm your favorite.

1286
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:42,594
Sacrifice. All I do is sacrifice.

1287
01:36:52,873 --> 01:36:56,036
Well, I guess I better go up
and say goodbye to Jenny.

1288
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:02,841
Jenny, I just came up
to say good...

1289
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:12,555
Goodbye, Jenny.

1290
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:40,619
Reckon when you said goodbye
it kind of tore them all up.

1291
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,586
Harley, you would have thought
I was dead.

1292
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:54,157
Calf on the ground.

1293
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:55,563
Hot iron!

1294
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:57,827
Burn him.

1295
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:07,508
O'Hanlan!

1296
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:12,384
This come for you.
All the way from Cheyenne.

1297
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:14,180
Thanks a lot.

1298
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:18,249
Who's it from?

1299
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:24,187
- Jenny.
- Hey, Sullivan, give us a hand over here.

1300
01:38:35,476 --> 01:38:36,670
<i>Dear Johnny...</i>

1301
01:38:36,844 --> 01:38:41,213
<i>... Mr. Willowby, the lawyer, told me</i>
<i>what a proud thing it was you done for us.</i>

1302
01:38:41,382 --> 01:38:43,543
<i>Nobody in the world</i>
<i>but you would've done it.</i>

1303
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:46,117
<i>Except maybe D.J.</i>

1304
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,580
<i>Pauline found out there wasn't really</i>
<i>nothing wrong with her liver.</i>

1305
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,123
<i>It was just her corset was too tight.</i>

1306
01:38:52,293 --> 01:38:56,889
<i>Carrie Virginia got married to Pete Dodge</i>
<i>and have a baby girl now.</i>

1307
01:38:57,064 --> 01:39:01,330
<i>Pete had a fight with his brother Edgar,</i>
<i>but I don't know what it was about.</i>

1308
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:03,094
<i>The day after you left Cheyenne...</i>

1309
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,467
<i>... a lot of men named Markstone</i>
<i>came to the Social Club.</i>

1310
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:10,474
<i>They were right sorry not to see you</i>
<i>and your friend Harley.</i>

1311
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:15,812
<i>Well, Johnny, it's about sundown now,</i>
<i>so I'll have to stop.</i>

1312
01:39:16,483 --> 01:39:19,850
<i>I just wanted to say thank you, honey.</i>

1313
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:23,820
<i>And I just wanted you to know</i>
<i>we all love you.</i>

1314
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:27,289
<i>Affectionately, Jenny.</i>

1315
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,116
What she have to say, John?

1316
01:39:54,221 --> 01:39:57,748
Oh, nothing much.

1317
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:06,025
- Why didn't you let me read it?
- Well, Harley, I just didn't think you'd care.

1318
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:10,034
O'Hanlan, Sullivan,
go run them calves out of that dry wash.

1319
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:13,405
John, I liked them ladies
just as well as you did.

1320
01:40:13,574 --> 01:40:16,771
- I didn't say you didn't, did I?
- But you didn't even think about me.

1321
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:19,879
- Will you just let up?
- Can't you tell me what Jenny had to say?

1322
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:21,207
Just things. Just...

1323
01:40:21,382 --> 01:40:24,510
The trouble with you is you don't think
about other folks' feelings.

1324
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,448
- Harley, come on.
- I'll tell you what.

1325
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:29,589
It's ungraceful and indelicate
not to let me read Jenny's letter.

1326
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:32,658
- Harley, if...
- You're an old bull-windy bunch-quitter.

1327
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:36,193
All ewe-necked, feather-headed,
stubborn like Colorado mockingbird.

1328
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:40,459
I never in my life heard anybody go on
so much about a scrap of paper.

1329
01:40:40,634 --> 01:40:42,431
You ain't heard the first of it yet.

1330
01:40:42,603 --> 01:40:43,900
John, you ain't learned yet.

1331
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:46,631
You can't treat people
just any old way it pleases you.

1332
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:48,434
I remember a man from Denver once...

1333
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:52,067
- I don't wanna hear about the man from...
- You're the spitting image of him.

1334
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:54,476
He never thought about another soul
for a moment.

1335
01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:57,048
Nothing but downright selfish
is what he was.

1336
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:59,777
If he got a letter, he'd have done
just the same thing.

1337
01:40:59,953 --> 01:41:02,751
If I ever get a letter from the ladies,
I'll let you read it.

1338
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:04,982
That's because my heart's
in the right place.

1339
01:41:05,159 --> 01:41:08,128
Yeah, Harley, I saw in Cheyenne
where your heart is.

1340
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:11,492
- What do you mean by that?
- You think on it a while, Harley.

1341
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:15,499
John, all I'm trying to say is you should be
more thoughtful to your fellow man

1342
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:19,036
I just want you to leave me alone,
Harley, that's all.

1343
01:41:19,206 --> 01:41:22,642
- You could wear a man down to nothing.
- Yeah.

1344
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:59,602
