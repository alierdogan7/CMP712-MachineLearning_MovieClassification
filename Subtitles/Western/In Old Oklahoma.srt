1
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,118
(Train horn blaring)

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,952
(Men singing)

3
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,792
Yes, sirree!

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,590
As soon as I strike oil, that's what
I'm gonna get me. An automobile!

5
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,912
Oh, you can't depend on them things.
I'm gonna get me a gal with yellow hair.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,231
He's only a dirt monkey.
Now, I'm a real sky hooker.

7
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,675
Peanuts, popcorn,
cigars and cigarettes.

8
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,512
That ain't nothin'.

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,275
I heard someone made $78,000
in minutes over an oil lease.

10
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,430
Jim Gardner says
these railroad trains

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,511
will run on oil instead of coal.

12
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,558
You hear about them Wright brothers
that flew that plane?

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,278
Oh, I don't believe that.

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,112
Tickets! Show your tickets.

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,670
This is an outrage.
Why don't you put on more cars?

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,069
We do. These oil workers
keep filling them.

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,549
Don't blame the railroad,
blame Jim Gardner.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,074
You've got a chance
to get in on an oil boom

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,355
that'll make the land rush look petty.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,034
- Here, read this.
- Did you hear that, Ellie?

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,749
Yes, but you know about wheat.
You don't know about oil.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,798
What's there to know,
except it's in the ground?

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,189
Sign with Gardner today and get paid.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,238
$10 a day - your chance
to be a millionaire.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,438
- Ain't that worth taking a chance?
- I guess so. Just as you say.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,557
- I'll raise you a month's pay.
- Which you ain't got.

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,791
- Which I'll get and a million more.
- You tell him!

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,998
- If Gardner can do it, so can I.
- I could use his luck.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,594
I could use that million in his bank.

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,830
I'd be satisfied with his private car.

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,480
Help yourself. It's right behind us!

32
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,232
(All laughing)

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,189
- But Mr Gardner wanted to see me.
- Him in conference.

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,157
(Girls giggling)

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,435
Hey, conference over.

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,552
You wanted to see me?

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,790
You got a telegraph office in Cleveland?

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,916
Yes, but we're there only a minute.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,753
That's not time enough.
I've these wires to send.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,512
We've a schedule to make.

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,795
Make it up later, if you're smart.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,950
All right, Mr Gardner.
Anything you say.

43
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,478
- Always get what you want, Jim.
- That's right.

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,996
But you don't always want
what you can get, do you?

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,755
Look, honey, I'm very busy.
You'd better go up with your friends.

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,877
(Conductor) All out for Cleveland station.
All out.

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,269
- All out?
- Mm-hm.

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,032
All out.

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,353
(Man) All aboard!
(Second man) Plenty of room here!

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,238
- If you wanna be a millionaire!
- Be a millionaire!

51
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,992
There's plenty of room!

52
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,356
- Can we get a drink?
- No, it's a flag stop.

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,872
(Man) Wait, Cathy.
(Woman) Oh, here, take this, please!

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,997
- You don't have to leave.
- Walter, I'll miss my train.

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,675
- You can live this down.
- I don't want to! I want to live!

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,557
Listen to her, the shameless hussy!

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,359
You promised you'd never
speak to that woman again!

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,829
Mother, that's not
the charitable attitude.

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,388
Faith, hope and charity
won't help her.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,438
I don't want help.
Get out of my way!

61
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,988
That's exactly how I feel.
Pardon me, ladies.

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,469
(Walter) I'm sure
I can make you understand.

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,791
- Here, pop, take these wires.
- Hold your horses.

64
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,030
James E Gardner!

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,270
Oh, yes, sir! Right away, Mr Gardner!

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,669
Who's the beautiful sinner?

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,876
Why, that's Catherine Allen.

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,712
She wrote this here book.

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,552
Spicier than a pickled apple.

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,189
(Woman) I'll circulate a petition.
(Second woman) We'll all sign it.

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,078
Say you're sorry,
and you'll never write another book.

72
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,833
- They'll forgive you.
- But I'm not sorry!

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,198
And don't think you're pinning
any scarlet letter on my repentant bosom!

74
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,998
Wait.

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,278
In spite of everything,
I'll... l'll marry you.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,197
Walter! You'd do that for me?

77
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,590
- Yes.
- She will never call me mother.

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,478
Oh, Walter!

79
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,629
(Whistling)

80
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,075
Very interesting. I'd better read this.

81
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,116
Oh, Cathy!

82
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,475
You brazen creature!

83
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,232
You... you!

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,153
Jezebel's the word.
Oh, don't worry, Mrs Ames.

85
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,028
I wouldn't marry him
if he were the last man on earth.

86
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,997
Wild horses couldn't keep me here.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,275
- Let them have it!
- Now you're talkin'!

88
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,433
Don't think you're running me out.
I'm leaving of my own free will.

89
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,034
I'm going where people know
it's the 20th century.

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,793
- Where there are broad minds.
- (Conductor) Aboard!

91
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,314
I'm going to stand on my own feet!

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,995
- Not if you miss this train, honey.
- Free from all you ostriches!

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,389
(Men laughing)

94
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,152
- (Laughing)
- Who are you?

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,028
- You always leave town like this?
- First time I've been carried out.

96
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,954
- This is my pleasure.
- Well, I can take care of myself.

97
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,758
You bet you can.

98
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,751
Ooh, Christmas!

99
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,274
Allow me, if I'm not
too old-fashioned.

100
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,112
Thank you.

101
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,429
Hiya, chicken! Where'd you come from?

102
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,795
Boys, your seats.
Here comes Kerry Nation.

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,757
(All chuckling)

104
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,031
There must be at least
one gentleman in this coach.

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,238
Well, this is the 20th century,
when women stand on their own feet.

106
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,153
(All laughing)

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,874
- Here's a seat, honey!
- Let go of me!

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,475
I hear you wanted broad horizons.
Ain't this broad enough?

109
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,278
(Laughing)

110
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,992
Oh... thank you.

111
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,992
(Men muttering)

112
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,435
(Man) Who was that?
(Second man) Jim Gardner.

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,918
(Laughing)

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,672
Come along.

115
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,678
- This IS private, isn't it?
- And very convenient.

116
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,593
- Sit, make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

117
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,955
Why don't you take off your hat?

118
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,912
(Orchestral music playing)

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,991
You have those new flat records!

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,877
Mm-hm.

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,912
"A Woman Dares".

122
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,793
- Oh, you know?!
- Everything.

123
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,348
Catherine Allen.

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,319
What shall I call you? Catherine?
Katie? Kitten, that's it.

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,550
- Kitten?
- Sure. A baby wildcat.

126
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,312
Well, who are you?

127
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,437
Just a guy opening up
some oilfields around Sapulpa.

128
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,318
Are you James E Gardner?

129
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,790
That's right.
You know, you owe a lot to me.

130
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,350
From the look on that fella's face
after you kissed him,

131
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,352
he wasn't gonna let you go,
and I don't blame him.

132
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,678
What's that for?

133
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,115
Why does a woman usually slap a man?

134
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,992
You are a wildcat!

135
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,389
I'm not as wild as you think.

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,950
- (Door thudding)
- Oh!

137
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,793
Wait, you know
there are no seats up ahead.

138
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,711
I didn't think you'd mind that.

139
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,633
- I know I didn't.
- Get out of my way!

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,392
I'm no Jezebel!

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,994
I'm not even a good imitation of one.

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,157
I'm a schoolteacher.

143
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,117
A schoolteacher?

144
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,997
(Laughing)

145
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,799
If you don't stop laughing,
I'll slap you again.

146
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,394
Sorry. I thought you knew
something about life.

147
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,835
How could I know anything about life?

148
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,195
I've never lived... except in books.

149
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,430
I've never been anywhere
except in books.

150
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,080
All I've ever known
is books, books, books!

151
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,832
But didn't you write one?

152
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,117
- Yes, in self-defence!
- And now where are you going?

153
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,829
Kansas City, so I can experience
the things I've been writing about.

154
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,832
So people can't say
"schoolteacher" the way you did.

155
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,797
Of all places, why Kansas City?

156
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,717
Because my Aunt Clara's there.

157
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,677
Oh, I'm sorry.

158
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,548
Come on back, and give me
a chance to square myself.

159
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,990
You can't learn much about life
from an aunt in Kansas City.

160
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,752
Come to my town, Sapulpa.

161
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,354
I'll show you more there
in five minutes

162
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,556
than you'll ever see in Kansas City.

163
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,200
- (Music off)
- You oughta go to school.

164
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,430
Let someone else be the teacher.

165
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,397
- (Train brakes squealing)
- Oh!

166
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,313
Oh. Excuse me.

167
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,072
Guess I should've knocked.

168
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,470
- What is this? A hold-up?
- Just for a seat, mister.

169
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,393
- You can't flag down this train!
- I know it.

170
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,517
- Well, why'd you do it?
- My horse died under me.

171
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,556
- And I figured...
- You figured what?

172
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,915
Figured I'd carried
this saddle far enough.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,709
- Now, look, honey.
- (Train wheels squealing)

174
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,951
Oh, wait! There aren't
any seats up ahead.

175
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,828
He's walked miles.
You can't let an ex-soldier stand.

176
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,150
Oh, you noticed the pants.

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,629
Why, it's your duty as a citizen.

178
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,075
Mr Gardner, does he stay or go?

179
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,958
The young lady
would feel happier if he stayed.

180
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,951
That's real patriotic of you, ma'am.

181
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,758
Well, where are you going?

182
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,311
You know, I was arguing that out
with my horse just before he died.

183
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,077
Whether I'd go back around Sapulpa
and punch cattle again,

184
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,355
or wait till my money run out.

185
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,557
- Where do you want to go?!
- Where are you goin'?

186
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,676
Yes, where ARE you going?

187
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,115
- Kansas City.
- Kansas City.

188
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,510
- You violated rule number three.
- I did?

189
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,751
By rights, I shouldn't
let you ride on this train.

190
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,958
As long as Mr Gardner will put up
with you, it'll be all right.

191
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,237
- Well, thanks.
- That's very generous of you.

192
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,517
Somebody sure is,
judging from this lunch box.

193
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,716
- Anybody mind?
- No, go right ahead.

194
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,598
You folks pick up
right where you left off.

195
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,433
That's one thing
about these big hats.

196
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,991
If you really want to live,
you mustn't be afraid to take a chance.

197
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,439
You've got to learn to leap first,
look afterwards.

198
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,670
That's what happened to my horse.

199
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,950
Broke his neck.

200
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,032
As you were saying.

201
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,350
Don't be afraid to take a chance.

202
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,271
You've gotta play for high stakes.

203
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,148
Before we struck oil in my town,
it was a dust-covered prairie

204
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,277
with farmers trying
to squeeze a living out of the ground

205
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,830
when all the while
there was a fortune under their feet.

206
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,911
(Laughing heartily)

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,754
You're gonna have to excuse me, mister.
It's this book!

208
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,354
- What's so funny?
- Listen to this.

209
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,112
"They kissed,

210
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,432
"and the sun and the moon
and the stars reeled around them."

211
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,159
Them two could've started
quite a conflagration.

212
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,038
An author is entitled
to poetic licence.

213
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,476
Oh, nobody's entitled
to run that hog wild.

214
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,710
That's no way
to treat good literature.

215
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,031
If you want to find out
what the author meant,

216
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,872
read from the beginning.

217
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,635
Fine. But I don't think
it'll do much good.

218
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,439
- "Julie stood at the crossroads."
- Julia!

219
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,035
Yes, ma'am.
"Julia stood at the crossroads.

220
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,317
"Which way?
One road led to John and dull security.

221
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,994
"The other to Roger Hale
and exciting adventure."

222
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,752
He's ruining it.

223
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,990
Read to yourself, if you don't mind.

224
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,718
Oh.

225
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,633
(Mumbling)

226
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,478
I've known plenty of women.

227
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,597
I never asked any of them
what I'm asking you.

228
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,477
Get off at Sapulpa with me.

229
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,473
If my hunch about us is right,
you're not going to be sorry.

230
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,870
And if it's wrong, there's always
another train to Kansas City.

231
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,353
- Oh, but I couldn't.
- Why not?

232
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,274
Aren't you Catherine Allen?
The novelist? Woman of means?

233
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,078
Yes, but...

234
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,232
Well, if someone else were with me, I...

235
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
- Not alone.
- You won't be alone.

236
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,158
- I promise you.
- But I wouldn't dare.

237
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,993
Oh, I can't stand any more of this.

238
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,868
I'll bet whoever wrote that book
is some dried-up old maid

239
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,997
who'd run a mile
if a man looked at her.

240
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,798
Is that your opinion?

241
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,075
Yeah.

242
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,116
You know, I once had the idea

243
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,589
that she was warm,
beautiful and courageous.

244
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,796
But I guess you're right.

245
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,512
<i>(Conductor) Next stop
Sapulpa Junction!</i>

246
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,150
Here we are, boss. Home.

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
Well, they'll be
switching my car off here,

248
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,590
so if you folks are going on to Kansas City,
you'd better move on up ahead.

249
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,113
Looks like we're at the crossroads.
How did it go in your book?

250
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,795
"One road led to John and dull security,
and the other to..."

251
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,394
- (Conductor) Sapulpa Junction!
- That's right.

252
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,155
Well... this is where I get off.

253
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,231
Goodbye.

254
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,872
(Man) Howdy, Jim!

255
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,398
We, uh... better get going.

256
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,198
Isn't it wonderful?

257
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,999
Well, did you hear what the man said?

258
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,230
They're switching
this caboose off here.

259
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,512
Hey, sorrel top,
they'll be switching this coach off.

260
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,637
There's so much noise,
I can hardly hear you.

261
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,517
- (Conductor) Aboard!
- Come on!

262
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,513
(Man) Come on, step this way
for your golden opportunity!

263
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,593
Get rich by staking your field!
Only a few left.

264
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,989
(Conductor) All aboard!

265
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,549
<i>Your hands aren't gonna get chapped
just going to the next car.</i>

266
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,949
Only hired girls put on their gloves in public.

267
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,076
They're cutting off the coach!

268
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,917
- (Train horn blowing)
- I'm ready now.

269
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,952
Take your time.

270
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,433
Oh, good heavens!
I've missed my train!

271
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,671
Well, I never saw
a better job of missing one.

272
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,717
Well, you might have warned me.

273
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,756
My throat's raw from warning you.

274
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,717
That's very strange. I'm not deaf.

275
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,916
Lady, I... I...

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,672
I should've warned you.

277
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,514
You most certainly should have.
I'm not a mind-reader, you know.

278
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,832
Why, there's Mr Gardner!

279
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,593
Well, ain't that unusual!

280
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,910
(Man) Why don't you get a horse?

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,312
Oh, hurry, Mr Gardner. That gusher ain't
gonna wait for nobody.

282
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,837
The hotel coach is pulling out.

283
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,638
Please don't bother about me.

284
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,553
- I can look out for myself.
- I don't know.

285
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,871
<i>My granny always says,
next to eating with a sharp knife,</i>

286
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,555
there's nothin' so risky
as a pretty girl looking out for herself.

287
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,517
Your granny and I don't agree!

288
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,828
Mr Gardner! Mr Gardner!

289
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,798
- Why, Kitten, what happened?
- The most terrible thing.

290
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,916
I was hurrying off your private car

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,831
when suddenly, without any warning,

292
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,036
the train pulled off and left me.

293
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,792
That's wonderful. Get in here.

294
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,757
I was hoping that would happen.

295
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,115
- What will I do?
- Just don't worry.

296
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,668
There'll be another train
in a few days.

297
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,671
Until then, you're going to school.

298
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,593
Your teacher's going to be
James E Gardner, PE.

299
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,830
- PE?
- Uh-huh.

300
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,592
Practical experience.

301
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,511
Twist her tail, Cherokee.

302
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,751
- Is it safe?
- Runs like a deer.

303
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,956
(Car backfires)

304
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,230
Noisy snorting gasoline monster!

305
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,392
Consarn your death-claimed
gasoline buggy!

306
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,152
Take her easy, Despirit!

307
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,071
There ain't nobody gonna...

308
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,791
Daniel.

309
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,714
Daniel Somers, you young coyote!

310
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,360
Hoist yourself up here!

311
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,557
- What are you doing back here?
- Hiya, Despirit.

312
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,076
I ain't seen you
since we turned that stagecoach over.

313
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,832
Where you been keeping yourself?

314
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,115
Well, Cuba and the Philippines.

315
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,998
Say, uh... what's going on
around here?

316
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,799
- You ain't gonna like it no more.
- No?

317
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,429
Cattle's gone, sheep's come in,

318
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,557
James E Gardner struck oil.

319
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,155
Get this thing
to the blacksmith's shop.

320
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,958
OK, boss.

321
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,795
And the lady's luggage in my car -
take it to the hotel.

322
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,953
Sorry, but if you folks are going into town,
better get another coach.

323
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,712
Now, just a min...

324
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,030
- Hi, Mr Gardner.
- I'm using this one.

325
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,680
This'll take care of you.
I'm sure you don't mind.

326
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,558
- Come along, Kitten.
- Thank you.

327
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,592
Regular lollapalooza.

328
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,591
Yep, sure got all his buttons on.

329
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,956
Despirit, straight to my oilfield,
and use the whip.

330
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,038
Har! Hup!

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,233
What are you aiming to do
around here, Daniel?

332
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,154
Remember that wild pinto
I was chasing for a couple of years?

333
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,958
Yep, but you got him.

334
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,600
It's a sorrel I'm after this time.

335
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,037
You're on your way
to a thrill you'll never forget.

336
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,236
I'm... l'm almost sure of that.

337
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,237
I'll stake my life on it.

338
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,916
Give me them reins. Hiyah!

339
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,877
Hey, Despirit! Take it easy!

340
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,950
Hiyah! Hiyah!

341
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,957
Whoa!

342
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,037
Whoa!

343
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,152
- Hold it!
- You're fired!

344
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,390
Can't be fired. I ain't been hired.

345
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,392
She's a header!
She'll be bustin' through any second!

346
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,757
Hello. You hear that cat purr?

347
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,717
- She's gonna blow in.
- Yeah.

348
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,995
Why aren't those tools
under that casing?

349
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,913
- The cables are fouled!
- Get up there, free 'em.

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,877
Then be blown up with it?

351
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,475
I want those tools out now!
Stand by to hoick them.

352
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,911
Liked it the way it was.

353
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,632
Stuff sure smells, don't it?

354
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,191
It smells of life
and love and freedom.

355
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,112
It smells beautiful.

356
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,116
Well, to me, it just smells.

357
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,513
All clear! Take 'em away!

358
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,312
Clear off.

359
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,793
(Heavy rattling)

360
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,196
Here she comes!

361
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,558
(All cheering)

362
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,631
Yes, sir, that proves it.
Right on a straight line.

363
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,870
- Yeah, the Indian lands.
- Right.

364
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,155
And that's where the big pool is.

365
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,357
<i>And that's where you're gonna
spot in my next well.</i>

366
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,158
There are millions over there.

367
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,758
You'd better shut her in.

368
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,195
All right, men.
Let's put this kitten to bed.

369
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
He's turning this
into a throbbing new world!

370
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,713
Yeah? Well, I liked it the way it was.

371
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,030
Before he got it all messed up.

372
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,234
Great work, Rich.
See you in town tonight.

373
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,992
Biggest one yet, eh, Wilkins?

374
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,595
- And, by rights, it's part mine.
- What do you mean yours?

375
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,070
Everything I had went into this well.
This was my land.

376
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,628
You didn't lose it
running out of money.

377
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,837
You lost it because
you haven't got guts for oil.

378
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,070
I'd have sucked it out before selling.

379
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,628
Look, Mr Gardner,
I don't know what's legal,

380
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,836
but I'm getting what's coming to me!

381
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,390
I'm sick of hearing you cry.
I gave you fellas jobs.

382
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,914
Collect your pay and get off my land.

383
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,514
Your land? It's your land,
according to law.

384
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,194
And nobody can take it away from you!

385
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,952
Well, I can!

386
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,397
Cos if the way you got it is legal, so's this.

387
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,312
Thanks, cowboy.

388
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,557
What's the big idea?

389
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,916
You really didn't want to catch
that little fella, did you?

390
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,434
I ought to break his neck. Yours too.

391
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,988
I got no steady side in this fight.

392
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,958
When he had a gun and you didn't,
that was unfair.

393
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,519
So what?

394
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,878
So when you took out after him
with 75 pounds, which he ain't got,

395
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,155
that was taking
a little advantage too.

396
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,630
You're asking for this.
I'm gonna break your thick skull.

397
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,191
Oh, please, Mr Gardner!
After all, he did save your life.

398
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,750
All right, Kitten, you can
consider you saved his life.

399
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,389
Now get out of town, cowboy,
before I change my mind.

400
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,431
Go on.

401
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,511
Please, go!

402
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,750
I wish you'd make up your mind.

403
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,038
A while ago you wanted me to stay,
now you want me to go.

404
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,473
Oh... my!

405
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,758
Things are happening so fast,
it's like a... a two-ring circus!

406
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,035
You've only seen
the sideshow out here.

407
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,238
You'll have to wait till we get in town
for the main event.

408
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,437
I hope you won't be lonesome.
I'm riding up front.

409
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,431
I have some business with Despirit.

410
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,034
Of course. Business comes first.
We can talk later.

411
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,677
What are you doing in here?

412
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,115
Well, I was never one for walking.

413
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,475
Besides, I owe you my life.

414
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,074
What would you like to do with it?

415
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,391
I'll give it right back to you,
and some advice with it.

416
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,436
Open the door and jump out.

417
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,431
Don't worry about me, lady.

418
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,397
As my granny always says...

419
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,756
I'm not interested in
your grandmother's old-fashioned ideas.

420
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,512
Hey, she ain't so...

421
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,795
You'd be surprised how modern she is.

422
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,633
She's three jumps ahead
of your favourite author.

423
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,518
I'm willing to pay you.

424
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,558
Just because you smoked a peace pipe,
don't hold me up.

425
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,679
Then I'm dumber than you think
or you ain't as smart as I think you are.

426
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,512
All right, Despirit, you win.

427
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,909
Arrange a powwow
with Big Tree for tomorrow.

428
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,877
Just a plain introduction?

429
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,316
- Just how plain?
- Oh, howdy, couple of OKs.

430
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,358
How much to say
what a great guy I am?

431
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,112
That'll cost you money.

432
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,351
If I'm stretching the truth,
I've got to get paid.

433
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,317
I've got a very delicate conscience.

434
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,358
(Laughing) Despirit, you're a burglar.

435
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,592
I'll add 200 and make it 1,000
for a class-A introduction.

436
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,432
Giddy-up, boy.

437
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,472
(Man) Congratulations, Lucky.

438
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,028
This ought to make you
a multimillionaire.

439
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,398
Thanks, boys. Sapulpa will be one
of the biggest towns in the southwest.

440
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,357
I'll be paying out more money...

441
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,796
Suppose you start paying me
for my coach, Mr "Lucky" Gardner?

442
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,872
Despirit! Are you
working for me or for him?

443
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,918
What do you mean
by letting my carriage trade walk?

444
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,515
Now, Bessie, before you get
all het up, let me explain.

445
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,751
It's my fault. I have with me
a distinguished author.

446
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,912
An author of what is destined
to become a classic.

447
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,309
- "A Woman Dares".
- (Man) Sounds exciting!

448
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,108
I'm sure you'll be as impressed
by the honour as I am.

449
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,988
When people of this calibre visit Sapulpa,
it means we're growing up.

450
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,957
I don't know what to say.

451
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,350
I'm sure your granny
could think of something apropos.

452
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,917
This is where I get out.

453
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,676
(Gardner) It is my privilege
to present our distinguished guest...

454
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,796
(Applauding)

455
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,677
I told you to leave town.

456
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,638
I couldn't get out till I got in, could I?

457
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,233
(Laughing)

458
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,790
This is our distinguished guest -
Miss Catherine Elizabeth Allen.

459
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,952
(Bessie) Welcome to Sapulpa.
(Catherine) Thank you.

460
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,431
Well, just goes to show,
you can't judge a book by its cover.

461
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,715
That's what my granny should've said.

462
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,678
Bessie, meet Daniel Somers,
a friend of mine.

463
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,196
That ain't gonna help him get a room.
I'm full up.

464
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,157
Wait a minute.

465
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,028
He tripped up Big Jim Gardner,
throwed him right on his face.

466
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,839
Well, pleased to meet you, son.

467
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,911
Fix him up with a room.

468
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,991
Come here, Daniel.

469
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,712
Get to the bar.

470
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,557
Say, this is real elegant.

471
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,393
Yeah. Finest in the territory.

472
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,832
(Jim) Bessie!

473
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,036
- Miss Baxter, Miss Allen.
- How do you do?

474
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,157
- Pleased to meet you.
- I'm leaving Miss Allen with you.

475
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,356
- Take care of her, won't you?
- Sure.

476
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,670
I suppose she'll have the guest room?

477
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,116
Naturally. The best.
Cherokee, did you bring the luggage?

478
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,077
Everything here, boss.

479
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,435
- Max. Number three.
- Yes, ma'am.

480
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,909
Thank you.
Hope you'll be comfortable.

481
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,230
I'm sure I will be.

482
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,756
Get all dressed up, Kitten.
Tonight we're hitting the high spots.

483
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,512
- The main event.
- That's right.

484
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,318
(Bessie) Come along.

485
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,437
- Cherokee, get my bath ready.
- All right, boss.

486
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,517
(Bessie) Come on, dearie.

487
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,318
Gee, it's stale in here.

488
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,198
I'll open the window,
let some fresh air in.

489
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,191
Ah! That's better.

490
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,032
Uh, pretty classy, ain't it?

491
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,396
I... l've never seen anything like it.

492
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,631
You bet your life.
I've done all the decorating myself.

493
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,235
- It's lovely, Mrs Baxter.
- Oh, call me Bessie.

494
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,108
I'll help shake out your things.
They get messy in a bag.

495
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,031
Ooh, my, but that's heavy.

496
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,078
(Laughing) What have you got in here?

497
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,717
Some gold bricks?

498
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,633
Almost as valuable.
Copies of my book.

499
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,111
How'd you get started, dearie?

500
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,872
I was bored, I guess.

501
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,918
That'll do it... every time.

502
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,797
Just off the farm?

503
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,236
- Schoolteacher.
- Come again?

504
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,436
Schoolteacher.

505
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,750
That's what I thought you said.

506
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,910
Better come along with me.

507
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,033
Maybe you'd like to take a look
at the er... principal's office.

508
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,552
(Laughing)

509
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,717
I don't get it, honey.

510
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,268
Neither did he
until I slapped his face.

511
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,512
- You slapped Jim Gardner's face?
- I did.

512
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,194
- And you're here?
- I certainly am.

513
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,396
Come on, honey, and sit down.

514
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,189
I've got to hear this
from the beginning.

515
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,955
<i># Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing</i>

516
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,031
<i># The breeze is sighing</i>

517
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,031
<i># The night bird's crying...</i>

518
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,792
(Jim) Oh!

519
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,792
<i># For afar 'neath the star
her love is sleeping</i>

520
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
<i># While Red Wing's weeping</i>

521
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,397
<i># Her heart away</i>

522
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,391
(Jim) Very pretty.
(Daniel) Thanks.

523
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,152
The steers always liked it.

524
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,117
You made a big mistake today.

525
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,872
Yeah? How come?

526
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,351
There isn't a man in town
that wouldn't want to be indebted to me.

527
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,513
Maybe somebody else can take
a shot at you and we'll start again.

528
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,795
You're just lucky
Cherokee wasn't there.

529
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,519
Or both you and Wilkins
would be dead.

530
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,990
Not unless he can handle a gun
better than that buggy today.

531
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,914
- Maybe you like to find out, eh?
- Cherokee, scrub my back.

532
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,718
Oh, he does that too.

533
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,677
Anyway, you did me a favour.

534
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,558
I'll give you $100 to get out of town.

535
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,995
You sell your life pretty cheap, don't you?

536
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,957
All right, make it $200.

537
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,112
I'm kind of afraid
to pick up money that easy.

538
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,430
Might turn into one of them tycoons.

539
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,838
So here I am.

540
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,639
- You told him all about yourself?
- Everything.

541
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,950
He still asked you to get off?

542
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,712
Why, he begged me too.

543
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,190
Either he's getting older or dumber,
or you're the one.

544
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,796
Of course, he thinks I missed my train
but... confidentially, I didn't.

545
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,317
I wouldn't want him to think
I'd get off a train without a chaperone.

546
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,277
- Without what?
- A chaperone.

547
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,238
- Someone like my Aunt Clara.
- Listen, honey.

548
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,915
Your Aunt Clara couldn't even
sit in on a game like this.

549
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,468
This requires the services
of a professional.

550
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,552
Meet a new member
of your family - Aunt Bessie.

551
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,596
Oh, Bessie. You're wonderful.

552
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,955
Come on, now, cards on the table.

553
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,679
You're crazy
about the big guy, ain't you?

554
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,230
You know, I wrote about him
even before I met him.

555
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,312
He's exactly like
Roger Hale in my book.

556
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,916
"He led her into a new world
filled with exciting adventures..."

557
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,117
And they got married
and lived happy ever after?

558
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,760
- Well, of course.
- You got the right idea.

559
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,796
But I've got to warn you, kid,

560
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,997
when you're shooting
for orange blossoms with Jim Gardner,

561
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,798
you're playing for high stakes.

562
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,279
That's what he told me to do.

563
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,754
(Humming "Red Wing")

564
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,997
(Cherokee) Hey, take 'em off, clothes.

565
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,959
Hey, you. Take 'em off, clothes!

566
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,679
- You hear me?!
- I'm looking at the flickers.

567
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,228
(Jim) I don't like my clothes on you.

568
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,038
Don't you think they're becoming?

569
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,270
No, they're too big for you.

570
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,148
You figured you owed me $200.
I thought this was a bargain.

571
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,710
Are you gonna taken them off
or does Cherokee take over?

572
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,791
Do you mean here?

573
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,433
- Now?
- You heard the boss.

574
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,993
Well, I guess
you'll have to excuse me, ladies.

575
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,917
(Screaming)

576
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,790
- Do you want a job?
- Yep.

577
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,155
You've got one.
Cherokee, you're fired.

578
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,118
- I didn't say I wanted his job.
- Well, do you?

579
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,351
- These duds go with it?
- Mm-hm.

580
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,952
Maybe it'd be all right.

581
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,032
So long as I don't
have to wash your back.

582
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,554
Starting by throwing him out.

583
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,995
You heard the boss. Vamoose!

584
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,791
I'll wait for you in the lobby,
Kitten, eight o'clock.

585
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,952
- I'll be ready.
- Don't forget. We'll be waiting.

586
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,878
After you, boss.

587
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,760
Kitten, you're gorgeous.
You take my breath away.

588
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,990
You leave me a little breathless too.

589
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,718
It's good enough for me.

590
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,031
- Good evening, Mr Gardner.
- Mrs Walden.

591
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,633
Open them gates.

592
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,473
- Bonsoir, Monsieur Gardner.
- Good evening, Pierre.

593
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,597
We've held the performance.
Your table is directly centre.

594
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,956
- Not too near the orchestra, I hope.
- No. You'll love it.

595
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,798
- (Man) Good evening, Mr Gardner.
- Nice to see you.

596
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,876
(Daniel) Thanks, Kelsey.

597
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,632
Oh... er...

598
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,517
Here's one for you, boss.

599
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,477
What are you doing here?

600
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,437
Looking out for your interests.

601
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,829
(Jim) Were you invited?

602
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,480
If I'm gonna be on the job,
I oughta stay close.

603
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,120
- Come on. Get out.
- You want me to go?

604
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,031
Definitely.

605
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,714
I can take a hint.

606
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,077
<i>Why the extra glasses?</i>

607
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,516
We hoped you might honour us
with your famous champagne trick.

608
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,034
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, please do.

609
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,872
Anything to make you happy.

610
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,033
You see, the object is to fill
four glasses at the same time...

611
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,470
...without moving the bottle.

612
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,399
That'd even be prettier with goldfish.

613
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,710
- Jealous?
- Mm-hm.

614
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,352
Me too.

615
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,557
(Applause)

616
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,197
- It's like another world.
- And here's to its queen.

617
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,919

618
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,631

(Laughing)

645
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,391
- Al Dalton!
- Dan!

646
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,994
Hasn't the marshal
caught up with you yet?

647
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,913
Me and the progressive citizens
made a deal.

648
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,959
When the marshal's in town,
they hoist a white flag and I stay out,

649
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,439
and vice versa.

650
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,757

(Cheering)

653
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,433
Say, er, it's been rumoured
that you're getting soft-hearted.

654
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,397
Yeah? Who started that?

655
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,994
Well, you could do me a charitable act.

656
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,752
Yeah?

657
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,472
You know Jim Gardner?

658
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,392
Give me that gun, Dalton!

659
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,313
- Gardner asked for this!
- Take it easy, Al!

660
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,188
Let me loose! He's a double-crossing liar
and a cheap crook.

661
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,113
- He is not cheap.
- Keep out of this, cowboy.

662
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,236
I won't. Supposin' he is a big mouth?

663
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,595
Nobody's gonna shoot him
while I'm around.

664
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,557
Get him out of here, Despirit.

665
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,517
Did you hear what he said?

666
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,352
He might've killed you, Jim.

667
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,955
I don't understand it.
I always played ball with the boys.

668
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,508
Tried to warn you,
but you're too trustin'.

669
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,160
That fella meant business
and he ain't alone.

670
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,708
This is no soft job I walked into.

671
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,473
- Sit over here, will you?
- Oh, no. Not me.

672
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,949
My granny always said
it's downright unpolite

673
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,837
to shoot across the lady.

674
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,912
- It's me, honey.
- (Catherine) Come in.

675
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,072
I brought you a hair of the dog
that bit you.

676
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,754
My favourite pick-me-up.
How you feeling?

677
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,994
Oh, like I was floating on a cloud.

678
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,992
Come on, baby.
Tell me all the exciting incidents.

679
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,718
What did he say?

680
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,588
I'm beautiful. He told me so.

681
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,195
- Where'd he go from there?
- I'm different. He said that too.

682
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,236
- With gesture?
- Uh-huh.

683
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,397
- I confuse him.
- Are you sure of that?

684
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,869
He's never met anyone like me before.

685
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,678
I'm sure of that.

686
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,718
Ah, you're convincing me, baby.

687
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,472
Where is he, Bessie?

688
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,710
Up on the reservation in a powwow.

689
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,314
You better brush up
on your sign language.

690
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,072
- How.
- (Laughing)

691
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,195
(Chief speaking
Native American language)

692
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,391
(Despirit) This is Mr Gardner
and his lawyer, Mr Fenton.

693
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,119
- Mason, the Indian Agent.
- Howdy. Glad to know you.

694
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,556
That's Richardson, his head driller.
And Daniel, Daniel Somers.

695
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,437
(Chief speaking
Native American language)

696
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,192
(Replies in Native American language)

697
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,273
Oh, yes. Big Tree,
this is Jim Gardner.

698
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,477
Great white chief of Sapulpa.
He asked for a powwow.

699
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,312
Him like big wind.

700
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,918
He speak -
grass, trees, rabbit - everything go.

701
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,992
Big man. Powerful.

702
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,594
Very sharp like knife.

703
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,110
That's a thousand-dollar introduction.

704
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,470
(Big Tree) White chief speak.

705
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,438
Big Tree, your tribe owns much land.

706
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,035
From the rock of the wide moon
to the sleeping mountain.

707
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,634
- Hmm.
- This land has only trees and rocks.

708
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,156
Not good for grain. Buffalo gone now.

709
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,357
Deer will soon go.
Your sons will be poor.

710
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,158
(Honks horn)

711
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,992
(Laughing) Scare you?

712
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,149
No.

713
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,754
Mr Mason, you have our offer in writing.

714
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,512
(Mason) That's right.

715
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,149
<i>(Fenton) We agreed to give the Indians
12.5o/o of every dollar.</i>

716
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,994
That's thousands of dollars a day
if you just sign the agreement.

717
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,957
What do you think?

718
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,750
What you think,
little man with beard?

719
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,675
Who, me? Oh, I ain't much on thinking.
You better ask Daniel there.

720
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,275
Daniel's the thinkingest man
I ever knowed.

721
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,310
What you say, my son?

722
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,432
- I wish you hadn't asked me that.
- Speak up, Daniel.

723
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,198
I think you'd be suckers.

724
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,792
(Chief) Suckers?

725
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,872
What a squirrel is
when he lets the woodpeckers steal

726
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,269
the nuts he stored up for the winter.

727
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,316
Our friend has spoken.

728
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,595
What do you expect out of this?

729
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,989
Not a raise in pay.

730
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,356
My son, we will sign papers with you.

731
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,876
I don't want the deal.
I ain't in the oil business.

732
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,997
You bet you're not.
Not even on the ragged edge.

733
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,310
This doesn't settle a thing, Big Tree.

734
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,234
I'll work the oil
even if I have to go to Washington.

735
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,317
- Come on.
- I'd better ride in the back.

736
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,756
Oh, Jim. It's beautiful.

737
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,637
There are the Indian lands.

738
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,877
I heard about your losing them.
I'm terribly sorry.

739
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,757
Thanks. But I haven't lost them.

740
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,035
Tomorrow I'll make Big Tree
another offer.

741
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,997
I'll go direct to Washington.

742
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,957
What I want I get.

743
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,837
(Train horn blowing)

744
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,955
I'll be on that train tomorrow night.

745
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,235
- Won't I?
- That's right.

746
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,272
I do hope my ticket's
been validated correctly.

747
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,078
Let me see.

748
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,118
It would be awful
if I were left behind again.

749
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,272
- Wouldn't it?
- Yes, it would.

750
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,272
Why, Jim...

751
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,670
You didn't really think
I'd let you get away, did you?

752
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,478
I wasn't sure.

753
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,994
I'm crazy about you. You know it.

754
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,188
I wasn't going to use
the ticket anyway.

755
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,475
You don't need one on my train.

756
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,028
I'm the conductor
and the engineer too.

757
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,998
And every place
you've ever dreamed of

758
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,152
will go spinning past the window
of our private car -

759
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,118
Chicago, New York, London...

760
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,878
...Paris.

761
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,913
I don't care
whether we go to the moon

762
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,991
or whether we stay right here

763
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,957
as long as we're always together.

764
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,554
- Always?
- For ever.

765
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,431
I have an idea you'll be able
to hold me for a long time.

766
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,034
But wherever that place is
along the line,

767
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,749
when you get tired of the scenery,
just let me know.

768
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,034
Is that the only way we can travel?

769
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,997
It's the way I travel.

770
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,196
I promise you won't be the loser.

771
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,708
I'm sure I won't be the loser...

772
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,830
...because this is where I get off!

773
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,832
Hey, wait a minute!

774
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,232
Kitten, come back here.

775
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,154
<i>(Daniel) # Oh, the moon shines tonight
on pretty Red Wing</i>

776
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,276
<i># The breeze is sighing</i>

777
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,635
<i># The night birds crying</i>

778
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,633
<i># For afar 'neath his star
her love is sleeping</i>

779
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,359
<i># While Red Wing's weeping... #</i>

780
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,510
What are you doing out here?

781
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,318
What does it look like?

782
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,551
Wandering round in the woods
at night ain't exactly safe.

783
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,312
You better get in.

784
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,597
Thank you. I told you
I'll take care of myself.

785
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,477
Guess you're right at that.

786
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,957
But you better keep an eye out
for rattlers and coyotes and skunks.

787
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,554
A lot of mountain lions around here too.

788
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,518
But I guess you can
take care of yourself.

789
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,397
Come on, Brodie. Ah, Stubbie!

790
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,795
(Coyote howling)

791
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,552
Thanks, pal.

792
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,312
- Dan!
- Hold it!

793
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,516
- Hold it!
- Wait a minute!

794
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,910
- I've changed my mind.
- I was hoping you would.

795
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,669
We both looked kind of lonesome
the way we was.

796
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,671
Hiyah!

797
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,517
Moon sure is pretty tonight.

798
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,912
Don't you feel like talking?

799
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,277
The Indians offered you
the oil lease today, didn't they?

800
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,078
Yep.

801
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,789
- What are you going to do about it?
- Nothing.

802
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,871
That's what I thought.

803
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,792
- Too bad too.
- Why?

804
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,836
With those Indian lands,

805
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,832
you could amount to something,
do something worthwhile.

806
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,912
- You think so?
- Well, don't you?

807
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,436
I never thought much about it
one way or the other.

808
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,988
It's about time
you started thinking about it.

809
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,231
Do you want to be
just a cowboy all your life?

810
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,874
Doing odd jobs,
wearing other people's clothes?

811
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,560
Don't you realise
you could control everything?

812
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,757
You could be big, important.
Bigger than anyone around here.

813
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,834
Would you be satisfied if I went back
and punched Mr Gardner in the nose?

814
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,592
Giddy-up!

815
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,632
Hold the team, Smokey.

816
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,037
Must be an election going on.

817
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,235
Dan, you could be like that.

818
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,152
You mean full?

819
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,711
No, of course not. I mean you could
make everyone look up to you.

820
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,598
Can now, in there.
Unless I'm sitting down.

821
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,352
Oh...

822
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,993
(Despirit) Daniel!

823
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,911
You done it for us!

824
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,797
- Done what?
- We've been waiting.

825
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,190
You're going to make us all rich.

826
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,874
(Man) Thanks to you, cowboy,
lands in Oklahoma...

827
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,758
Oh, son, let me shake your hand.

828
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,717
You're gonna save us little fellas.

829
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,758
Rich and five of Gardner's
best men are with us.

830
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,796
Shut up, Wilkins. Let me talk.

831
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,757
Keep still! Let me tell him.

832
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,512
Take up the Indian lease.

833
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,194
The whole town's backing you
against Jim Gardner.

834
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,952
I'm no oil man.

835
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,554
I may be nothing else,
but I'm an oil man.

836
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,950
- Now you're talking, Rich.
- (Dan) I ain't even a businessman.

837
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,793
(Bessie) I am.
(Man) You've nothing to worry about.

838
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,711
(Dan) Drilling wells takes money.

839
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,711
(Despirit) That's what we're saying -

840
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,870
we raised the money,
us little fellas.

841
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,793
It'll be us and the Indians
instead of Gardner.

842
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,757
- What do you say?
- I'm sorry.

843
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,991
- The Indians gave you the lease.
- We've got some rights.

844
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,231
- I'm not the man for this.
- You're just the man!

845
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,709
If you don't take it up, Gardner will.

846
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,916
He's going to Washington to get the lands.

847
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,389
(Catherine) Well, if he can, we can!

848
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,040
(Man) Sure, she's right.
(Despirit) Say you will.

849
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,590
If you don't think anything
of yourself, think of the others.

850
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,398
- Give us a chance!
- Yes.

851
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,392
You work those lands,
you'll give us all a chance.

852
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,040
We can lick that Gardner to a frazzle.

853
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,758
(Man) Sure we can.

854
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,638
Seems like everybody's
made up their mind but me.

855
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,757
It ain't my money
and it ain't my oil lands.

856
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,628
I know how you folks feel
and I'd like to please you,

857
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,474
but still and all,
I've got to sleep on this proposition.

858
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,075
That's good enough for me.
Drinks on the house for everybody.

859
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,038
(Men shouting)

860
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,509
(Man) Come on! You heard the man!

861
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,793
Ain't you taking a roundabout trip
to the orange blossoms, honey?

862
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,310
To the bar, boys!

863
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,030
Oh, Dan, come along.
I want you to dance with me.

864
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,956
Everything else has happened to me.
I might as well go whole hog.

865
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,871
Well, I'm not made of glass.

866
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,837
- Huh?
- I won't break.

867
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,869
Oh. I'm warning you -
my feet ain't as light as my head.

868
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,236
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- Am I?

869
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,197
(Catherine screaming)

870
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,475
Stay out of things
you don't understand.

871
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,437
Daniel! Stand back! Give him air.

872
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,192
Oh, Dan. Dan.

873
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,874
Hey... what happened?

874
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,678
Three guesses.

875
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,150
- Gardner.
- Give the gent a cigar.

876
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,073
I guess I slept on that proposition
long enough.

877
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,038
- How do you get to Washington?
- (All cheering)

878
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,836
Hasn't the president sent for you yet?

879
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,638
No. Still warming the chair.

880
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,392
Has Jim been in there?

881
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,552
In and out more times
than a Sunday shirt.

882
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,312
Fix your tie. Look pleasant.

883
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,391
Why? Am I having my picture taken?

884
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,994
(Man) The president
will see you, Mr Gardner.

885
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,752
Thank you. Good afternoon.

886
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,628
At least we can say we saw somebody
who saw the president.

887
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,875
Gentlemen, I'm warning you -

888
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,758
I'm prejudiced
in favour of the Indians.

889
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,717
If their land is opened up,

890
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,190
I'm going to be positive
that they get the best deal possible.

891
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,669
I have studied
both applications carefully.

892
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,637
I'm ready to give my decision.

893
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,678
You have the full support
of the Department, Mr Gardner.

894
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,116
I've met every requirement
of financial backing and experience.

895
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,952
Mmm. That's more than I can do.

896
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,678
Where is the other applicant?

897
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,673
Daniel Somers is a penniless Oklahoma
cowboy with nothing to recommend him.

898
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,637
Dan Somers? Is he in Washington?

899
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,917
- He's outside, but the Department...
- Hang the Department.

900
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,518
- Sergeant Dan Somers?
- Yes, sir.

901
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,272
Come here, my boy.

902
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,750
Delighted to see you. How are you?

903
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,638
- Still kicking, Mr President.
- That's what I'm doing.

904
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,837
- Where did you go after Cuba?
- The Philippines, sir.

905
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,070
The Philippines, huh?
Come in. Come in.

906
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,950
Say, how did you get to the top
of San Juan Hill ahead of us?

907
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,190
I had the longest legs, I guess.

908
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,319
My boys have a dog with long legs.
They named him Sergeant Somers.

909
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,391
- I hope he's good.
- He is.

910
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,279
The sergeant was one of the toughest
scrappers in my old regiment.

911
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,476
Well, if that don't beat a carpet.

912
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,597
I presume you know each other.

913
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,636
Of course.

914
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,315
Now, making a decision,
as I've pointed out,

915
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,789
my only interest is in the Indians.

916
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,273
<i>I see, Mr Gardner,
that you offer them 12.5o/o royalty</i>

917
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,999
<i>while the sergeant here
offers them 50o/o -</i>

918
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,752
unquestionably a better deal.

919
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,912
Not if the man lacks
the money and the experience

920
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,831
to develop the lands, Mr President.

921
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,229
<i>- Quite so.
- 50o/o royalty is unheard of.</i>

922
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,311
It's... it's fantastic!

923
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,868
(Gardner) How Mr Somers
expects to make good

924
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,077
with no experience
and a few farmers, I can't answer.

925
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,832
Perhaps he can.

926
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,912
Would you like to try
to answer that, Sergeant?

927
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,595
Well, what Mr Gardner says is so -

928
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,638
about us being a small detachment
of dirt farmers.

929
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,553
But these men came in
with the land rush

930
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,200
and stuck through the dust
and the drought.

931
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,398
Most of them ain't oil men
but they'll make a go of things

932
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,517
because this is their chance
to take a chance,

933
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,556
to have something for themselves.

934
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,313
<i>And about that 50o/o -</i>

935
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,277
I was raised around the Indians

936
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,874
and I've seen them pushed
and squeezed enough.

937
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,078
If my offering them half of
what already belongs to them is fantastic,

938
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,674
then that's what I am, whatever it is.

939
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,991
I don't suppose you have
any personal interest in this?

940
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,516
Of course I have.
I ain't doing this for nothing.

941
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,637
<i>I'm a 1 o/o stockholder in this deal.</i>

942
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,755
Sergeant, how long will it take you
to sink a well if you keep pushing?

943
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,638
Our head driller
says about four months.

944
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,159
Gentlemen, our country
owes all of its progress

945
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,549
to a small detachment of pioneers -

946
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,269
men who asked only
for the chance to take a chance.

947
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,636
That spirit
is the essence of America.

948
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,869
Sergeant, I'm going
to give you your chance.

949
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,632
Thank you, sir.

950
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,915
You have four months to make good.

951
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,949
(President) It is understood, Mr Gardner,

952
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,429
that you are to take over the deal,

953
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,389
providing that Mr Somers fails to comply
with the conditions of output and delivery.

954
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,755
- That clear?
- (Gardner) Yes, Mr President.

955
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,512
Good day, gentlemen.

956
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,239
Well, congratulations...

957
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,072
on winning the first round.

958
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,630
- Come on, let's celebrate!
- Yes, let's do.

959
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,516
"Providing, however, that this grant
to Daniel F Somers and Company

960
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,797
"shall be void unless a well
is completed within four months

961
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,075
"and unless
Somers and Company deliver

962
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,116
"a minimum
of 10,000 gallons of oil

963
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,549
"to the Oklahoma Refinery
at Tulsa, Oklahoma

964
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,312
"on or before August 31."

965
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,516
- Short, sweet and final.
- And airtight.

966
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,114
- How's he getting along?
- He's doing all right.

967
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,988
Can that outfit deliver 10,000 gallons of oil
before September 1?

968
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,470
- I could.
- Well, that's different.

969
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,710
Hold those wagons. Hold it!

970
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,270
Start unloading that lumber.
We're going to spot in right here.

971
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,713
Where?

972
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,270
Three steps off that rock
Despirit's sitting on.

973
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,032
What are you, a marker?

974
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,998
One, two, three.

975
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,799
- Right here.
- No, here.

976
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,758
We'll split the difference.

977
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,351
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

978
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,908
I've been over
every inch of this reservation,

979
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,639
my nose scraping the ground
like a hound dog.

980
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,438
Well, here's hoping.

981
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,397
You looking for somebody, Cherokee?

982
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,755
Look for you. Want job.

983
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,593
Sorry, we're fresh out
of bodyguarding jobs.

984
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,194
Try your old boss -
there's an opening there.

985
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,396
His side not my side.

986
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,677
You work for Indian. I work for you.

987
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,558
You really serious about that "work"?

988
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,392
Sure. Me strong.

989
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,153
Let's see how strong you are
unloading them wagons.

990
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,471
- Then we'll talk.
- Sure, boss.

991
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,513
- (Catherine) Oh, Dan.
- (Bessie) Whoa!

992
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,160
We're waiting for you
to drive the stake.

993
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,073
Come on, honey.
And give it everything you've got.

994
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,879
(Laughing) Well,
this is really an occasion.

995
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,837
I guess you'll need some help.

996
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,276
No, I can do it. I want to.

997
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:49,273
Hold it. Let's christen this well right.

998
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,075
That's my last drink
till the well's in and the oil's delivered.

999
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,196
- (Bottle smashing)
- Nice going, Rich.

1000
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,277
- Now...
- Better take your hand away.

1001
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,191
I got confidence in you.

1002
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,632
Shut her down, Dan.

1003
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,394
- How far are we down?
- About 900 feet.

1004
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,994
The deeper we go, the richer it looks.

1005
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,595
Like most things, Wilkins -
you dig deep to get anything worthwhile.

1006
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,194
We'd be better off with a new bit.

1007
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,068
We lose time dressing this one
and waiting while she cools off.

1008
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,037
Why don't we buy another one?

1009
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,908
On account of the Oklahoma Tool
Supply Company is owned by Gardner.

1010
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,877
Where you been all this time?

1011
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,235
Can't we get one from Kansas City?

1012
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,436
Sure, get delivery
in about two months.

1013
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,636
Our date in Tulsa's in two weeks.

1014
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,917
Let the boys get back
on their job. Come on.

1015
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,672
Well, goodbye, Dan.

1016
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,878
Oh, uh, here, uh...
I uh... got something for you.

1017
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,712
Oil sands, huh?

1018
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,268
(Dan) No, it's a bottle
full of rainbows.

1019
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,032
What does it mean, Dan?

1020
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,953
You never see a rainbow
unless the storm's over

1021
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,712
and fair weather's ahead.

1022
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,396
And if you follow a rainbow,
you sometimes find a pot of gold.

1023
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,437
Oh, a bottle full of rainbows.

1024
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,875
Boy, that would go
straight to my head.

1025
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,916
- Well, so long, Dan.
- Goodbye.

1026
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,108
Now, then. All together, fellas.

1027
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:54,356
<i># Down by the old mill stream</i>

1028
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,989
<i># Where I first met you...</i>

1029
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,559
(Catherine) Whoa.

1030
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,790
- Evening, Miss Cathy.
- Hello, Despirit.

1031
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,919
<i># Your eyes of blue</i>

1032
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,552
<i># Dressed in gingham too...</i>

1033
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,077
I suppose your granny always tells you
a stitch in time saves nine.

1034
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,355
The way she always puts it, we...

1035
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,954
Oh, never mind your granny.
Give me that.

1036
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,752
New moon.

1037
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,479
- Did you make a wish?
- No.

1038
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:36,350
But if I had, it'd be to see you
sitting there sewing just like that.

1039
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,628
There. I made a wish
for both of us. Do you mind?

1040
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,030
Any way you want it,
that's the way I want it.

1041
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,190
You never talk much, do you?

1042
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,238
Maybe that's because
my granny always says

1043
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,039
the second fiddler's
got to wait his turn

1044
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,634
before he can sing out good and loud.

1045
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,915
If you had made a wish,
what would it have been?

1046
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,788
You know the bend in the river
where the cottonwoods grow?

1047
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,075
I'd build me a house right there.

1048
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,674
I didn't know
you thought of such things.

1049
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,230
I've been thinking about that
since I was a little tyke.

1050
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,153
I even thought of it
over in the Philippines.

1051
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,470
I could see it just as plain...

1052
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,429
Smoke coming out of the chimney,
nice horse in the corral.

1053
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,032
I could even see a girl with sorrel hair
standing in the doorway.

1054
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,188
But of course now that
I'm pretty near a dashing tycoon, almost,

1055
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,998
things will be different.

1056
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,789
<i>The house will be bigger,
be extra rooms for the kids,</i>

1057
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,552
a big open fireplace.

1058
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,110
There'll be a fancy stable
instead of that old pole corral.

1059
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,918
Is that all you want?

1060
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,672
Well, what else is there?

1061
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,788
Oh, Dan. If I were going to be
a dashing tycoon, I'd be dashing.

1062
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,111
I'd have automobiles
and private railroad cars.

1063
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,509
Why, I'd have a whole train.

1064
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,718
If I found someone I wanted,
I'd sweep her right off her feet.

1065
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,237
I'd take her with me
to the end of the line - all the way.

1066
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,992
You would?

1067
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,798
I certainly would.

1068
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,189
I'd be bold and daring, I...

1069
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,036
You know, I'm going to like
this dashing tycoon business.

1070
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,312
I...

1071
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,992
I'd better be going.

1072
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,798
Oh.

1073
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,434
It looks good, don't it, Rich?

1074
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,590
Use your nose. Smell it.

1075
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,398
It's oil. Sure!

1076
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,357
It's gas fumes you smell now.

1077
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,910
<i>Next comes the oil -
a gusher or I miss my guess.</i>

1078
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,151
What's it like
when a really big gusher blows in?

1079
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,596
I've seen them tear
the whole derrick up at the roots.

1080
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,478
- How soon?
- Any time now.

1081
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,075
Hey, did you hear that? Any time.

1082
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,878
Oil!

1083
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,715
- Tie it up, boys.
- (Men grunting)

1084
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,917
- (Bessie) Come and get it!
- (Bell ringing)

1085
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,355
Come on, boys. Come on. Wash up.

1086
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,910
Make the most of it.
This is our last hot meal.

1087
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,672
And no more smoking.

1088
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,754
Can't afford to take a chance
with all that gas rolling in.

1089
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,436
<i>(Despirit singing) # If I had a bank
like Pierpont Morgan</i>

1090
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,116
<i># And Miss Annie Hill
would hold me and sing</i>

1091
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,273
<i># If I ambled to the altar
with Heddy Green... #</i>

1092
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:03,672
<i>- Whoa!
- # Then I'd be satisfied all right...</i>

1093
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,753
(Shouting) Quit it, will you?
Stop your fooling, Daniel.

1094
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,355
I was only drying your beard,
you old Rocky Mountain canary.

1095
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,237
Come on. Grub's a-waiting.

1096
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,676
Thanks. You put me first in the line.

1097
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,637
Mmm, that smells good.

1098
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,438
Be nice. Pass it on.

1099
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,599
Oh, no, thanks. I ain't got no appetite.

1100
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,080
Like a little kid
waiting for Santy Claus.

1101
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,832
Well, ain't we all?

1102
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,068
Get back!

1103
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,512
Wilkins is out there!

1104
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,519
He's still alive.
Go get the backboard, Despirit.

1105
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,430
(Dan) Watch his back.
(Man) Hold him.

1106
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,197
Stay here. Check up on things.

1107
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:26,068
- I'll say I'm going to check up.
- See you at the hotel.

1108
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,875
Just sent a wire to Mrs Wilkins.

1109
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,150
- How is he?
- I don't know yet.

1110
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,231
The doctor's still in there.

1111
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,792
Well?

1112
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,077
Nothing left out there
but a hole in the ground.

1113
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,515
We... washed up?

1114
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,677
Unless we can get a hold
of a portable rig.

1115
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,590
You'd better go in now.

1116
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,398
How is he, Doctor?

1117
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,632
Hiya, Wil.

1118
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,874
She blew in a gusher, didn't she?

1119
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,034
Yeah. Sure.

1120
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,075
Then we're... all rich, ain't we?

1121
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,475
You can take her easy now, partner.

1122
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,950
Emma used to joke and say

1123
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,828
that out of our first barrel of oil,

1124
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,592
I was to buy her...

1125
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,391
<i>...a sewing machine.</i>

1126
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,989
Do you think you could see
that she gets it, Dan?

1127
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,113
Sure. It's the first thing I'm going to do.

1128
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,316
Then I got nothing
to worry about, have I?

1129
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,913
Nothing to worry about.

1130
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,912
(Weeping)

1131
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,835
I got a sewing machine
downstairs, Dan.

1132
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,469
Thanks. This one's
got to be brand-new.

1133
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,032
Daniel.

1134
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,311
Now I remember.
Cherokee was fooling around with the boiler

1135
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,072
when we was washing up.

1136
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,470
That was no accident out there.
It was dynamited.

1137
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,150
All this time we've been playing
right into Jim Gardner's hands.

1138
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,832
Oh, wait a minute. Dan.

1139
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,435
You may be wrong. Don't go there.
Somebody will be killed.

1140
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,671
- Somebody has been killed.
- But it won't help matters if...

1141
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,432
Let me handle this.

1142
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,317
But, Dan, it may be you!

1143
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,917
Aren't you going to stop him?

1144
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,718
No, ma'am.

1145
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,755
Oil well gone. Everything blow up.

1146
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,070
I use dynamite. Smart, eh?

1147
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,071
- You thought I'd be pleased?
- Sure.

1148
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,355
I'm not. Why did you do it?

1149
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:12,877
I no like cowboy. You no like cowboy.
Now I get job back.

1150
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,632
You stupid...

1151
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,871
(Catherine) I must see Mr Gardner.
(Man) Sorry, he's busy.

1152
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,077
Jim, Dan's coming here.
Someone blew up our well.

1153
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,118
- He thinks you...
- I had nothing to do with it.

1154
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,919
- Someone will be killed.
- Thanks for the warning.

1155
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,959
- You don't want it to be me.
- I don't want it to be anyone.

1156
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,917
You've licked us. Isn't that enough?

1157
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,036
Jim, stop things
before they get worse.

1158
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,715
You know, Kitten, you've changed.
You're more attractive than ever.

1159
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,836
Get outta the way!

1160
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,552
Dan, I asked him.

1161
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,438
He had nothing to do
with dynamiting the well.

1162
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,955
Stop and think, cowboy.
If I had, you'd have been blown up.

1163
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,871
I'm not sure about you yet.

1164
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,715
But I am sure about the Cherokee kid,
and I saw him come up here.

1165
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,838
Wilkins was killed
and that's gonna be paid for

1166
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,118
if I have to tear the town apart,
beginning with your pet rabbit.

1167
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,628
All I want is that portable oil rig.

1168
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,517
Why don't you come get it?

1169
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,990
I'm going to. I'll tell the sheriff
why I killed him.

1170
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,752
What are you gonna say?

1171
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,552
Self-defence.

1172
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,677
The same thing
if I find you on my property.

1173
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,235
Dan, I want to talk to you.

1174
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,197
You picked your side. Stay there!

1175
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,433
(Despirit) 4,375...

1176
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,750
(Man) Getting hold
of this portable rig

1177
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,957
by starting that prairie fire
was a great idea, Dan.

1178
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,635
(Dan) Maybe, but the well
ain't in yet. Keep working.

1179
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,678
(Despirit) 4,378...

1180
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,639
4,379...

1181
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,188
- 4,3...
- (Dan) Stop counting!

1182
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,068
We've been drilling through
that oil sand for the last six hours.

1183
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,390
Now, why don't she cough it up?

1184
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,152
(Mouthing silently)

1185
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,797
4,384.

1186
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,235
(Coyote howling)

1187
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,596
Ah, coyote!

1188
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,752
4,386...

1189
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,071
4,387...

1190
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,950
Well, we're all set to cap her
when she comes in.

1191
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,712
Yeah. When?

1192
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,518
Cup of coffee?

1193
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,995
Well, he beat the oil in.

1194
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,957
Stick to your jobs.

1195
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,315
Keep working as long as you can.

1196
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,192
Hello, Gardner.

1197
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,952
Nice weather we're having.

1198
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,271
I don't suppose you heard
about the fire last night?

1199
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,238
- No foolin'? Put it out?
- (Gardner) Mm-hm.

1200
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,790
Funny thing - when we got back,
my portable rig was missing.

1201
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,472
You don't say!

1202
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,552
All right, men. Take down my rig!

1203
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,835
I thought you'd be expecting me.

1204
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,592
I was, kinda.

1205
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,910
You didn't think I'd be coming alone?

1206
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,672
No, not exactly.

1207
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,274
(Man calling out
in Native American language)

1208
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,154
Watch it, men! Keep your eyes open!

1209
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,789
(Speaking
in Native American language)

1210
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,075
(Shouting
in Native American language)

1211
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,832
What'd he tell him?

1212
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,878
He says this fight
belongs to you and him, personal.

1213
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,195
Hold it, men,
unless they start something!

1214
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,398
(Grunting) I guess
that puts the weight on our side.

1215
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,758
Cowboy, I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

1216
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,717
(Dan) Don't let me disappoint you.

1217
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,351
Make him holler, Daniel!

1218
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,920
Give him that one-two I showed you!

1219
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,112
Look out!

1220
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,674
What in tarnation's
holding Gardner up?

1221
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,432
What's holding Dan up?

1222
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,073
(Well roaring)

1223
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,835
(Dan) Cut her off! Cap her!

1224
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,480
You can have your rig now,
Mr Gardner.

1225
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,030
And we'll pay you
for the wear and tear on it.

1226
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,792
Yeah? When?

1227
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,757
Right after delivery tomorrow.

1228
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,593
Tulsa's a long way from here.

1229
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:17,877
How you gonna get
10,000 gallons of that stuff

1230
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,520
to the refinery before it closes?

1231
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,272
Through the pipeline.

1232
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,955
(Laughing) lt'll be a neat trick
if you can do it.

1233
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,871
I just bought the pipeline.

1234
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,076
Thanks for the gusher.

1235
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,833
You can have the rig. Come on, men!

1236
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,592
(Laughing)

1237
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,831
Say the word, Daniel,
and I'll mow him down!

1238
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,076
I'll burn the well before I see it
handed to him on a silver platter!

1239
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:51,240
We gotta dig up everything
that'll carry oil.

1240
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,757
We ain't got a chance.
There ain't half a dozen tankers fit to use.

1241
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,116
No, but there's lumber
and there's tar and there's tonight.

1242
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,918
There is a chance!

1243
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,957
Got her working, Rich?

1244
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,240
You bring in those tankers, I'll fill 'em.

1245
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,276
Well, you'll be filling before morning.

1246
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,117
How much does she hold, Mil?

1247
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,997
Just about 500 gallons.

1248
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,552
That does it, Dan.

1249
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,111
Drive on down to the main road
and wait with the rest of them.

1250
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,277
Come on, get a move on!

1251
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,237
We're running oil, not molasses.

1252
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,880
(Man) You heard
what he said - get busy!

1253
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,238
Hey, that cowpoke can get
real cantankerous, can't he?

1254
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,710
So can Jim Gardner.
Come on, we gotta look busy anyhow.

1255
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,678
I can never remember
which way a left thread turns.

1256
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,432
To the right, naturally.

1257
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,192
(Laughing)

1258
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,117
Hot Joe! Got the coffee ready!

1259
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,077
(Despirit) Eats! What a pleasure.

1260
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,878
Help me, Despirit.

1261
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,638
Uh-huh - just like
my granny always says,

1262
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,553
"The way to a man's heart's
through his stomach."

1263
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,676
Oh! (Laughing)

1264
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,918
(Pan clanging)

1265
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,991
Come and get it!

1266
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,512
Grub's ready!

1267
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,797
- Coffee and stuff!
- (Dan) Get back on the job!

1268
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,758
We can eat later
when time don't mean anything.

1269
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,753
They can't keep working without food!
They're dead tired and so are you.

1270
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,559
Is everything ready, Bessie?
I'll pour the coffee.

1271
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,029
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to help.

1272
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,236
- Ain't you a little mixed up?
- No.

1273
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,311
I thought you'd picked your pasture.

1274
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,316
I didn't pick anything.

1275
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,597
You did that for me.
You took it for granted...

1276
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,070
You were just passing the time of day
with Mr Gardner?

1277
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,268
Daniel, someday
I'm gonna be forced to whip you.

1278
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,192
Come and get it!

1279
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,073
(Men chattering excitedly)

1280
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,873
When we get started,
line out single file.

1281
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,996
And keep 'em close together!

1282
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,437
Well, we're all here.

1283
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,988
- Let 'em roll!
- Hiyah!

1284
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,079
<i># Oh, if John D Rockefeller
was my valet</i>

1285
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,630
<i># And I had my vittles
served by a king... #</i>

1286
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,230
That fire come up this canyon
like it was a smokestack!

1287
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,437
- What do we do?
- We're going through. Fast.

1288
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,478
(Despirit) Get back in line!

1289
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,358
You can go through, Somers,
but I'm going back.

1290
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,318
Rich, get up there
and take over those lines!

1291
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,432
- Get away!
- You heard him. Move over!

1292
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,431
Let 'em roll!

1293
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,750
You know fire and oil don't mix?

1294
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,479
If you don't like it, get out! Hah!

1295
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,632
Hiyah!

1296
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,832
Say, you're on fire!

1297
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,395
What do you make of this, Daniel?

1298
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,950
Looks like somebody got the idea
of fighting fire with fire.

1299
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,951
Get up on another wagon!

1300
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,752
Hah!

1301
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,558
Hiyah!

1302
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,914
(Bessie) Better get
some wood for the fire.

1303
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,388
If they don't get here soon,
we're sunk.

1304
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,358
Oh, they'll make it.
Dan'll bring them through.

1305
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,274
Yeah. Well, I better get
that coffee back on the fire.

1306
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,476
When we get to the relay station
we'll have some work.

1307
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,754
Keep 'em rolling, fellas!

1308
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,513
Grub and fresh horses ahead!

1309
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,473
Hah!

1310
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,592
Here they come!

1311
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,077
Bessie!

1312
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:14,478
- Bessie, they're driving in!
- Come on, get busy! Get busy!

1313
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,672
All right, you fellas.
Get them teams changed!

1314
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,234
Oh, Dan, we thought
you'd never get here!

1315
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,880
- You're hurt!
- Don't worry about me.

1316
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:37,837
Come to the wagon. We'll bandage...

1317
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,388
Want to help? Stay out of the way.

1318
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,631
Hurry up with them horses!
We ain't got all day!

1319
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,272
Hey, you jughead.

1320
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,271
- You been riding upside down?
- Huh?

1321
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,830
If you ever talked to me
the way you talk to her,

1322
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,753
you'd be unwrapping yourself
from around a coffee pot.

1323
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,308
Some people learn
to keep their mouths shut.

1324
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,597
That's what we promised
and that's what's caused the trouble.

1325
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,399
- What?
- You thought she went to warn HIM.

1326
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,710
It was YOU she was thinking about!

1327
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,234
She tried to get us to stop you,

1328
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,151
but we was too crazy mad

1329
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,038
to think about anything
but trying to get even.

1330
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,953
She was thinking
about keeping you out of trouble.

1331
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,476
This is the thanks she gets.
Why, you lump-eared mule!

1332
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,313
Get over there now
and straighten yourself out!

1333
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,519
(Man yelling) Work fast!
Shake out them ribbons!

1334
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:51,111
I don't seem to be doing
so good by myself.

1335
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,237
I wondered...
Could I get you to help me?

1336
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,471
- Aren't you a little mixed up?
- Yes, ma'am.

1337
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,232
I'm plenty mixed up.

1338
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,549
Sit down. Let me help you.

1339
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,075
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry if I hurt you.

1340
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:30,311
That's just what
I've been trying to say to you.

1341
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,591
Let's not talk about that.

1342
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:41,593
Let's talk about the bend in the river
where the cottonwoods grow.

1343
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:43,352
You remember that?

1344
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,908
Why, of course I remember!

1345
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:52,598
I remember the... the house
and... the pole corral.

1346
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,229
No, that was gonna be a fancy stable.

1347
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,992
(Rich) Dan?

1348
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,877
I've been checking with the men.

1349
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,269
We haven't a chance
to make Tulsa before 6:00.

1350
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,476
- We're sure gonna try.
- Sure, we'll try.

1351
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,269
Gardner will be helping Witherspoon
close those gates on the minute.

1352
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,510
- Charlie Witherspoon?
- That's right.

1353
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,108
- Is he gonna close them gates?
- Yeah.

1354
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,237
Over my dead body!
And it ain't dead yet.

1355
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,437
Come on, sister.
We've got loads of work to do.

1356
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,238
See you in Tulsa, Dan!

1357
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,992
Come on. Let's get rolling.

1358
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,913
Wait till they hitch the horses
to the wagons.

1359
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,672
Oh!

1360
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,111
(Bessie) Got a long way to go
and a short time to get there!

1361
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,152
Mr Gardner!

1362
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,437
Well, Miller? They turn back?

1363
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,115
No, came right through the fire.
Smashed a few wagons, that's all.

1364
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,634
Stupid cowboy.
Doesn't know when he's licked.

1365
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,392
What do we do now?

1366
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,755
Relax. Everything is being done.

1367
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,631
I want those orders straightened out!

1368
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,597
I guess that'll settle it.

1369
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,398
- Hello, Charlie!
- Why, hello, Mr Gardner!

1370
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,198
Come in, come in!

1371
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,751
It looks like your luck is holding.
I guess you'll work the Indian lands.

1372
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,877
Get your hat.
It's all over but the celebrating.

1373
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,394
Oh, I can't leave
till closing time tonight.

1374
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:22,392
My signature goes to Washington
on those contracts too.

1375
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,357
A mere technicality. Get your hat!

1376
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,273
I'd like to, but I've gotta stay till 6:00.

1377
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,590
You can have a drink, can't you?

1378
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,557
I don't mind if I do.

1379
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:34,074
There's nothing against that
in the contracts.

1380
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,594
(Man) Get your reins in your hands.
We're moving!

1381
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,513
Hurry up! Grab a bite and let's get going!

1382
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,038
You all set?

1383
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,792
Yeah, let's go.

1384
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,070
It's a long way to Tulsa, men.

1385
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,798
Let 'em roll!

1386
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,357
Come on, let's get going.

1387
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,398
I'm sorry, Mr Gardner. Not till 6:00.

1388
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,159
That's right, Charlie.
Stick to your principles.

1389
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,196
You know, I have plans.

1390
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,033
- They might include you.
- Yeah?

1391
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,033
Things ought to be happening
pretty soon now!

1392
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,949
This is like shooting fish in a barrel!

1393
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,913
If you can't ride that, get to the rear!

1394
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,638
Blame that fella up ahead!

1395
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,349
- This one's going on awful fast.
- Shut up.

1396
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,998
(Catherine) There's Tulsa!

1397
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:38,759
And that pipeline I bought

1398
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,479
empties right into your storage tanks,
doesn't it?

1399
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,353
You mean you're gonna buy out
this whole refinery?

1400
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,352
You're beginning to catch on.
And that's only a starter.

1401
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:51,318
- (Charlie whistling)
- We can go far together, Charlie.

1402
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,516
- (Clock chiming)
- (Charlie) Yeah!

1403
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,593
That should clear your conscience.
Let's lock up and paint the town.

1404
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,237
Gardner must be inside!

1405
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,390
All right, kid, you keep him occupied

1406
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,835
while I make Witherspoon
forget the time.

1407
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,595
<i>(Charlie) # Come along with me, Lucille</i>

1408
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,638
<i># In my merry Oldsmobile</i>

1409
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,508
<i># Down the road of life we'll fly... #</i>

1410
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,353
- (Bessie) Hello, Charlie!
- Bessie!

1411
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,273
- Charlie! How are you?
- I'm awfully glad to see you.

1412
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,635
Why, Jim Gardner -
imagine finding you here!

1413
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,433
(Gardner) Quite a coincidence.
(Bessie) Hiya, Jim.

1414
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,954
I don't like to interrupt this little reunion.

1415
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,076
- But it's after 6:00.
- That's right.

1416
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,674
You ladies wait here while I close up.

1417
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,320
I'll be right back
and we'll all celebrate!

1418
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,868
Oh, no, you don't, Charlie!

1419
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,190
You told me that 15 years ago!

1420
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,748
This time I ain't taking no chances.

1421
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,876
(Laughing)

1422
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,076
(Bessie) I'm staying right with you!

1423
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,071
Kitten, I'm glad you're here.

1424
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,993
We... we've lots
to talk about, haven't we?

1425
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,957
Certainly have.

1426
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,600
- (Laughing)
- Now you can get busy!

1427
01:33:57,080 --> 01:34:00,390
Keep driving
unless you want a little of the same!

1428
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:15,318
We're a mile from home.
Stay with her, Despirit!

1429
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,154
I'll stay with 'em
till the wheels come off! Hiyah!

1430
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,069
- You sure you don't want a drink?
- No, thanks.

1431
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,037
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

1432
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,510
Before the fight's over?
Isn't that bad luck?

1433
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,070
The fight is over.
The cowboy was licked before he started.

1434
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,833
We both know that.
I'm talking about us.

1435
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,434
- Us?
- We've wasted a lot of time, Kitten.

1436
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,397
Let's get back on the train.

1437
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:47,268
We'll go straight to the end of the line
with no stopovers

1438
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:50,318
except for a honeymoon
at Niagara Falls.

1439
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,472
- What do you say?
- I got off that train a long ago, Jim.

1440
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,711
I'm trying to catch a ride
on a cowboy's wagon.

1441
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,472
And here he comes!

1442
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,437
Charlie? What happened to your boss?

1443
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:10,308
I believe the lady took him
for a buggy ride, Mr Gardner.

1444
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:16,792
Dan!

1445
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,198
Dan!

1446
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,510
- Dan, I knew you could do it!
- With gallons to spare!

1447
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,433
You made it.
You don't know when you're licked.

1448
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,638
You can't bring oil in with those every day,
but I've got a pipeline...

1449
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:46,191
I've got a proposition to make you
in my office, when I get one.

1450
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,397
Why not in here?
Never let pleasure interfere with business.

1451
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,198
Sure. Excuse us.

1452
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:53,832
Where's Daniel?

1453
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,797
He's in conference with Jim Gardner.

1454
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,917
(Punching and scuffling)

1455
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,957
What happened?

1456
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,713
Gardner's sleeping
on that proposition I made him.

1457
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,677
Oh, what'd you do that for?

1458
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:11,276
Now we got money, I want to buy back
that thousand-dollar introduction.

1459
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,874
Here you are, Rich.
You kept your word.

1460
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:16,793
Well, come on!
We ain't on the wagons now!

1461
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,268
Dan, you're going to be a real tycoon!
And you can build...

1462
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,193
WE can build...
that house by the river.

1463
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,431
And let's have your granny
come and live with us.

1464
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,431
- Who?
- Your granny.

1465
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:33,910
Oh, uh, there's just one catch to that.

1466
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,958
- What?
- Well, I ain't never had a granny.

1467
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,759
That is, leastwise, that I can remember.

1468
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,389
You see, she was only uh... uh...

1469
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,357
poetic licence.

1470
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,112
You faker!

1471
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,872
You fraud!

1472
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,552
You darling!
