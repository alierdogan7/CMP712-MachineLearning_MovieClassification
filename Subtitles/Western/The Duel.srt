<i>( rain pattering )</i>

00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:51,110
<i>( choir singing )</i>

3
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,439
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

4
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,848
( horse neighs )

5
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:41,293
<i>( men arguing )</i>

6
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,507
We got them agitated,
didn't we?

7
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,943
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

8
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,182
You ride with God today.

9
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,851
You know I ain't got
no religion.

10
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,721
Do you not fear the eternal
hell that awaits you?

11
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,424
I ain't planning
to see it just yet.

12
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,426
( men laughing )

13
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,632
Good people of Helena.

14
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,901
Good people of Helena!

15
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,537
I am saddened

16
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:30,642
<i>because today Helena loses
one of her true sons.</i>

17
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,712
Now we've cleansed
the Mexican filth from our city,

18
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,516
but the disease left behind
has infected our civility.

19
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,351
Man: <i>That's right!
You hear that?</i>

20
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,621
These brown heathens pushed
their carts through our land.

21
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,291
And instead of uniting
against these indignations,

22
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,660
we stand here divided.

23
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,763
Watch yourself, Jesse.

24
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,866
Abraham is trickier
than the devil in the shade.

25
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:58,770
And so,
on the challenge given

26
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,808
<i>to Abraham Brant
from Jesse Kingston,</i>

27
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,811
in the way
of a Helena duel,

28
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,546
are we now assembled?

29
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,748
Take care of my boy
if I fall.

30
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,986
We will.

31
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,660
Gentlemen, come forward.

32
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:25,264
God made this world, Jesse,
and it pains me little

33
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,332
to send you from it.

34
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,806
You shall pour out
each other's blood

35
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,909
and we will cover it
with dust.

36
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:43,882
Whomever bleeds
the dirt red the most today,

37
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,952
his deeds shall not
be forgotten.

38
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,027
<i>( choir continues )</i>

39
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,664
( horse whinnies )

40
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,842
You distinguished yourself
honorably against the Cheyenne.

41
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,978
It was the Comanche
in my day.

42
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,049
Either or, the most contemptible
breed of people, don't you agree?

43
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,385
Perhaps.

44
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,622
Or perhaps they're misunderstood,
Your Honor.

45
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,525
I understand you have
a problem with a dead Mexican.

46
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,661
Ross: <i>Not "a" dead Mexican,
Mr. Kingston.</i>

47
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,597
<i>Dozens.</i>

48
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,600
<i>The latest one is the nephew
of a Mexican general...</i>

49
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,802
<i>Ernesto Calderon.</i>

50
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,439
<i>He went missing along with
his sister some time ago.</i>

51
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,442
<i>The general... kicking up
quite a fuss about it.</i>

52
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,944
<i>He's threatening to bring a
battalion of Mexican soldiers</i>

53
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,147
<i>across the border
to look for his niece</i>

54
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,082
<i>and the man who killed
his nephew.</i>

55
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,453
Now, I don't need to tell you,
wars have started over less.

56
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,955
Now, all the bodies
are turning up

57
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,525
in the same strainer
in the river...

58
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,193
about here.

59
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:12,097
It's roughly 12 miles
from Mount Hermon.

60
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,034
I take it you've heard
the name Abraham Brant.

61
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,474
Foolhardy stories,
tales from the war, mostly.

62
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,076
They call him the Preacher,
I believe.

63
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:30,682
I saw him once in Kansas
just before the war.

64
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,919
The ranchers near Wichita
were offering 50¢

65
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,021
for every red scalp
that was turned in,

66
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:39,157
and Brant showed up
with 1,000 of them.

67
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,626
Red, Mexican, negro...
it didn't matter,

68
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,563
as long as they had
dark hair and dark skin.

69
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,933
<i>And later, I saw him
preaching to half the town</i>

70
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:52,637
with a spirit that I have
neither seen before nor since.

71
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,973
And as God
as my witness,

72
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,643
I saw him
lay his huge hand

73
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,513
on this gimpy
teenage girl.

74
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,016
And he cured her
with a touch,

75
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,552
<i>like Christ himself.</i>

76
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:13,825
Pardon me,
Your Honor, but...

77
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,161
but you'll have me believe
he simply touched the girl

78
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,029
and she walked?

79
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,031
All the way
to the church.

80
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,767
Married her
the next day.

81
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,003
I'm assuming he resides
in Mount Hermon.

82
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,807
He<i> is</i> Mount Hermon,
Captain.

83
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,076
Now you'll travel alone

84
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,778
under an assumed name
and profession.

85
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,715
Time is of the essence.
Calderon's blood is up.

86
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,683
Why not send me
with a company?

87
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,519
There's too much at stake.

88
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,788
You simply find out if Brant is
at the root of these killings

89
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,957
and wire me
from Fort McIntosh.

90
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,594
Once certain,
I will commit in force.

91
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,600
How long?

92
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,239
I'm not sure.

93
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,775
I think it's best
not to presume this time.

94
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,211
You've only
just now returned.

95
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,883
What is it?

96
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,922
David?

97
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,563
The man
I'm inquiring upon...

98
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,032
Abraham Brant is his name.

99
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,268
He may or may not be responsible
for some terrible things.

100
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,337
It's my job
to determine which.

101
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,575
Go on.

102
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,877
By some...

103
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,684
strange twist of fate,

104
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:49,854
Brant happens to be the same man
that killed my father 20 years ago.

105
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,093
Now, I know
what you're thinking,

106
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,330
but truth is, men like Brant have
orphaned hundreds of boys like me.

107
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,032
And it was
my father's challenge.

108
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,234
David, you know as well as I,
you will go there

109
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,970
and you will kill
this man.

110
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,906
You don't know that.
You can't know that.

111
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,609
<i>Why else would you
be sharing this?</i>

112
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,611
<i>I've never once
heard you speak like this.</i>

113
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,047
I'm curious,
that's all.

114
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,952
They say he's been
touched by God.

115
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,293
Marisol, I'll go
where they send me.

116
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:32,030
It's not as if I've been chasing
this man my entire life.

117
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,239
I can ride as well as you.
You taught me to track...

118
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,041
It's crazy talk.
We should change the subject.

119
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,709
You're gone more
than you're ever here.

120
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,978
What happened
to the Tompkins woman

121
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,681
only a month ago
was south of Austin.

122
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,983
<i>And not just some rogue
straggler we've somehow missed,</i>

123
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,286
but a band of Cheyenne
and Comanchero.

124
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,255
Would you like me
to describe to you

125
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,958
exactly what they did
to that poor woman?

126
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,765
This is coming
from the governor himself.

127
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,768
<i>At least here,
we both know you're safe.</i>

128
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,739
Since you took me,
you come and you go.

129
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,742
I'm left here
with nothing to do.

130
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,312
There's the Sheltons.
Donahues are less than a mile.

131
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,883
( speaking Spanish )

132
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:35,460
Marisol, this is a job.
It's my work.

133
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,432
You can't expect me to put
you in that kind of danger.

134
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:45,403
Then perhaps this time
when you return,

135
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,372
I will have left.

136
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,010
Excuse me.

137
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,974
( screeching )

138
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,933
You kill it,
you clean it.

139
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,220
<i>( distant coyote howls )</i>

140
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:18,356
Marisol: You've never
spoken about him.

141
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,626
Do you miss him?

142
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,396
From all accounts, Jesse Kingston
was recalcitrant and headstrong

143
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,932
and got what he deserved.

144
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,935
I figure he picked
the wrong fight.

145
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,539
What about you?

146
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,075
You ever miss old Javier?

147
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,344
You changed the subject.

148
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,280
( speaks Spanish )

149
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,320
It's impossible
to love someone

150
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,956
who hates their self
that much.

151
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
I miss nothing.

152
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,538
( screeching )

153
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,684
Morning, gentlemen.

154
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,523
Saw smoke.
Thought we'd see to some lodgings,

155
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,659
rest our horses.

156
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,296
What brings y'all
this way?

157
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,998
We're on our way
to Ciudad Victoria.

158
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,434
The map at Fort McIntosh
showed a town.

159
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,370
Mount Hermon, I believe.

160
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,609
Someone had the good
sense to chart it.

161
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,412
We figured we'd practice the same
good sense to stop and make use.

162
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,714
She family or help?

163
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,954
My apologies.
My name is David Locke.

164
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,322
This is my wife Marisol.

165
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,694
Of course, if there's
some trouble in town,

166
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:06,097
we could return to Fort McIntosh
and pass on word for you.

167
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,504
You need to see
the preacher.

168
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,518
<i>( chatter )</i>

169
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,289
Put that down.

170
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,079
<i>( door opens )</i>

171
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:38,289
( Abraham muttering
in Latin )

172
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,324
We have new guests.

173
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,560
They're asking for lodgings.

174
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,530
They shall have it.

175
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:48,366
Welcome to Mount Hermon.

176
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,739
From where is it
that you come?

177
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,775
Houston, sir,
by way of Fort McIntosh.

178
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,411
My name is David Locke.
This is my wife Marisol.

179
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,619
I'm Abraham Brant.

180
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,456
You've met my son Isaac.

181
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,195
He says welcome.

182
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,702
Abraham: I am Mount Hermon's mayor
and law when there's need,

183
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:29,207
but I am unfailingly
the town's ethereal counselor.

184
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,808
Marisol,
are you religious?

185
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,510
I'm spiritual,

186
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,746
but I do not like
religion, sir.

187
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,382
Me neither.
And you, David?

188
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,585
My wife and I
are one and the same, sir.

189
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,520
<i>Please,
we are not formal here.</i>

190
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,857
"Abraham" works just fine.

191
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,695
- Abraham: Morning.
- Man: Morning, Abraham.

192
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,396
Here we are.

193
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,232
Make yourself at home.

194
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,800
Thank you, Abraham.

195
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,336
All we need now
is some rest.

196
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,204
I'll leave you to it.

197
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,639
<i>Buenas noches, Marisol.</i>

198
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,876
Mr. Locke.

199
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,524
We'll be here only as long
as we need to.

200
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,627
Just stick to the story,
let me do my job

201
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,662
and we can leave
this place,

202
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,764
just as easy
as we came in.

203
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,636
Okay?

204
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,504
Okay.

205
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,681
<i>( rooster crows )</i>

206
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,687
<i>( soft chatter )</i>

207
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,193
Morning, gentlemen.

208
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,235
Isaac: What are you
doing out here?

209
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,665
I never let the sun
catch me sleeping.

210
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,334
And I enjoy acquainting myself
with any new place.

211
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,269
How'd you find your cabin?

212
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,971
It was fine, Abraham.
Thank you.

213
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:11,609
- And Marisol?
- She's tired, resting.

214
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:15,580
If she's unsatisfied,
I could drop off another blanket,

215
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,615
<i>keep her warm.</i>

216
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:21,219
Well, it's a large bed. I doubt
you'd have a blanket big enough.

217
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,758
Isaac, you go on
without me today.

218
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,994
Mr. Locke is going
to join me for breakfast.

219
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,963
Well, I... I thought
we was going to go down...

220
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,298
Do I need to hold
your hand, boy?

221
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,808
Forgive my friends, David.

222
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,645
Their charming qualities don't
shine through at the outset.

223
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,980
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

224
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,650
<i>You strike me
as an educated man.</i>

225
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,019
I've managed to fool you.

226
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,956
You hide it
from your eyes well,

227
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,260
but it sits on your
shoulders plain as day.

228
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,663
You are a man
in search of something.

229
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,966
<i>Perhaps absolution.</i>

230
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,968
You don't strike me
as the type

231
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,537
to hide his meaning
in vocabulary.

232
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,375
Indeed.

233
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,345
We don't get a lot
of uninvited guests this way.

234
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,982
So why are you here?

235
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,286
There's no real plan to it.

236
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,956
I inherited my father's
mercantile in San Antone.

237
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,525
<i>I ran it for some years.</i>

238
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,595
Things got rough.
I was robbed, shot.

239
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:41,399
Both of us felt it was time to
move on, head nowhere particular.

240
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,634
My wife's family
are in Ciudad Victoria.

241
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,369
We figured we'd strike out
in that direction,

242
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:48,406
stop in a place
if we took to it.

243
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,541
Not so strange,
is it?

244
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,811
Welcome
to nowhere particular.

245
00:21:56,015 --> 00:22:00,084
Can't say it's the warmest
welcome I've ever received.

246
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,621
We're protective
of our little oasis.

247
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,557
How long
will you be staying?

248
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,793
Long enough to rest,
a few days.

249
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,565
Perhaps I can convince you
to stay awhile.

250
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,767
Why?
You've only just met me.

251
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,937
I know people.

252
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:25,109
And I can tell that you're
a man one can tie to.

253
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:29,447
Perhaps I can help you find
what you're looking for.

254
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,618
I'd have no trade
in this town.

255
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,090
Well, let's just say
a spot for town sheriff

256
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,126
just opened up
at this very moment.

257
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:48,632
I get the feeling there's not
a strong demand for law here.

258
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:52,403
- No.
- <i>And I have no experience.</i>

259
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,505
Well, what do you
need to know?

260
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,508
Just let your moral compass
be your guide.

261
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,478
<i>You're obviously
strong, capable.</i>

262
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,046
You're actually
being serious.

263
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,015
Look, David,

264
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,084
I like you and Marisol,

265
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,954
and I'd like to see you
stay awhile.

266
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:11,956
Not so strange.

267
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,725
No.

268
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,894
No, it's not.

269
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,430
Well, then,
it's settled.

270
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:22,032
Gentlemen,
meet your new sheriff.

271
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:34,979
Thought I might continue my ride,
take in some of your countryside.

272
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,747
Splendid idea.

273
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,651
As it happens, I have
my own fond recollections

274
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,889
of the San Antone area
from after the war.

275
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,657
Small town...

276
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,126
name of Helena.

277
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,862
<i>Might have passed through
her on your way here.</i>

278
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,664
Don't seem
to recall it.

279
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,603
Wild place
is what I recollect.

280
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,539
Hard to forget.

281
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,544
Well, Sheriff,

282
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,679
pick yourself
a direction.

283
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,851
( sniffs )

284
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,088
<i>( knock on door )</i>

285
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,590
Welcome to Mount Hermon,
Marisol.

286
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,125
We brought you both
some food.

287
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,794
And we just had to meet
the wife of the new sheriff.

288
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,030
- Sheriff?
- Did you have a long journey here?

289
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,700
- Yeah, but...
- <i>You are more beautiful</i> than was spoken of.

290
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,602
Who spoke?

291
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,628
( sniffs )

292
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,833
( woman humming )

293
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,677
( humming continues )

294
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,388
You live round here?

295
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,693
I from Tamaulipas.

296
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,831
Why have you come?

297
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,300
To pray for the dead.

298
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,802
You know about
the bodies?

299
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,739
( humming )

300
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:25,342
Was it white men?

301
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,411
( speaking Spanish )

302
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,802
( humming )

303
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:04,181
They knew things, David.

304
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,816
Who came?

305
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,985
Women from the town.

306
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,820
What did they want?

307
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:12,823
They said you were
the new sheriff,

308
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,893
that Abraham
foresaw us coming.

309
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,032
He did ask
that I be sheriff.

310
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,235
- But why on earth?
- I have no idea.

311
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,105
But I thought about it.

312
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:32,710
Really, it's the ideal cover until I
can figure out what's going on here.

313
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,780
He frightens me, David.

314
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,416
He's a man, Marisol,
not a crystal gazer.

315
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,722
- No one knew we were coming.
- Yeah.

316
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,758
These people, they're just
a bit off the reservation.

317
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,094
Make sure
you remember that.

318
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,301
- ( chatter )
- ( horse snorts )

319
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,181
Woman:
<i>Stop it.</i>

320
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,849
- Get away from me.
- ( slurring ) Now, now, wait.

321
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,285
Don't you walk away.
Come on.

322
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,988
<i>Don't you walk
away from me.</i>

323
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,189
<i>Where are you going?</i>

324
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,792
Come on, have a drink.
Naomi.

325
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:03,534
( chatter )

326
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,979
- ( horses nicker )
- ( chickens clucking )

327
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:36,366
I'm terribly sorry to have
frightened you, Marisol.

328
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,270
You're not feeling well.

329
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,075
No, I feel fine.

330
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,277
No, no, you have
the fever.

331
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,913
It's natural.
You're run down.

332
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,149
It will pass.

333
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,920
Can I give you a hand
with anything?

334
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,358
Are you married,
Abraham?

335
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,628
My wife died many years ago
birthing Isaac.

336
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,633
She left him
with many of her talents.

337
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,337
I'm sure
she was beautiful.

338
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,573
She could back the buzzards
off a gut wagon.

339
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:23,280
But truly, she was lovely.

340
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:27,284
There was never a more pure
heart to wreck a man.

341
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:32,923
So tell me,

342
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,393
how did you
come to wreck David?

343
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,298
My father was a drunk
and a swindler.

344
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,069
He was shot and left for dead
after cheating at cards.

345
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,572
David saw him
back to health.

346
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:52,476
As a show of gratitude,
I was betrothed to him by my father.

347
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,280
Betrothed by debt?

348
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,949
<i>That must have been
very difficult for you.</i>

349
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,318
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

350
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,553
Any children?

351
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,026
I'm afraid I'm unable.

352
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:13,096
Mmm. My wife was told
the very same thing

353
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,332
before I met her.

354
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,405
Dark eyes.

355
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,342
<i>They say the eyes</i>

356
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,412
<i>provide a direct window
to the soul.</i>

357
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:33,050
Yours have seen a good deal
of man at his worst.

358
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,353
<i>You hold tight to it.</i>

359
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:41,358
But are we not all
born into sin,

360
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,264
anger, violence,
jealousy, desire?

361
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,967
We cannot separate
ourselves from sin

362
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:54,004
any more than we would sever
a limb from our bodies.

363
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:59,409
<i>Besides,
anger is instructive.</i>

364
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,578
<i>Jealousy, understandable.</i>

365
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,549
Lust, perfectly natural.

366
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,991
I can see that my words
are not lost on you, Marisol.

367
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,760
It is refreshing.

368
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:21,765
So few these days possess
any openness of mind.

369
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:26,603
But if I may, Marisol,
this veil that you wear

370
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,772
offers only false comfort.

371
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,374
Remove it.

372
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:34,111
God knows
who you really are.

373
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,687
Ah, Deputy Dave!

374
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,655
What are you doing here?

375
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,158
Thought I might
get a drink.

376
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,028
Aw, you wouldn't
like it in here, David.

377
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,497
The beer tastes
like day-old piss.

378
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:57,734
Well, I guess
I'll drink the whiskey.

379
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:02,305
I don't think
you're hearing me, Sheriff.

380
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,508
I'm telling you no.

381
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,450
( sighs ) I've tried to be
cordial with you.

382
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:16,486
You choose your next
words carefully.

383
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,403
- ( laughter, chatter )
- <i>( piano music playing )</i>

384
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:42,212
I heard the beer here
is excellent.

385
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,814
I've no complaints.

386
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,762
Might I join you?

387
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,730
Be my guest.

388
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:04,434
Hoot, let's have a shot
for the gentleman.

389
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,136
I'm Naomi.

390
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,571
David.

391
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:09,206
I know who you are.

392
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:13,176
Hoot his real name?

393
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:16,279
That's what I hear.

394
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:19,516
What else do you hear?

395
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,751
Whatever falls earshot.

396
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,324
You have an honest face.

397
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,862
I'm not soliciting you.
I know about your wife.

398
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,731
News travels fast.

399
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:38,368
This town echoes every word
Abraham breathes.

400
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,172
Stay here long enough and you
might start resounding him, too.

401
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,773
What about you?

402
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,843
Not yet.

403
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,412
How long have you
been here?

404
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,814
Almost a year.

405
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,384
My second husband was a
lieutenant in the army.

406
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,320
He was shot and killed
by his own men.

407
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,290
<i>I had no money,
no family, nowhere to go.</i>

408
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:05,729
Until Hoot here rides into town,
offers me a job.

409
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:09,599
Perhaps naively,
I didn't ask for specifics.

410
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,569
My condolences
for your losses, ma'am.

411
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,539
Thank you.

412
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,609
I've tried to make
the best of it.

413
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,445
Save a little money,

414
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,481
maybe move
to San Francisco.

415
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:27,317
Well, you're a long way
from California.

416
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:29,953
Believe me, we're a
long way from anywhere.

417
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,256
Like these fellows?
Just rode in?

418
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,398
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Ma'am.

419
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,303
( softly )
You're not safe.

420
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,271
I've tried
to leave this place.

421
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:51,808
Naomi, you gonna sit there
yabbering on my time,

422
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,445
head on back, help Mailene
with the washing.

423
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,414
Be careful.

424
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:03,253
Hello there, gentlemen.
How are you?

425
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,692
Money's no good here, Sheriff.
Abraham's pardoned your expenses.

426
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,736
Abraham visited me
this morning.

427
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,342
Was he alone?

428
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,677
Yes.

429
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,847
<i>What did he want?</i>

430
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,250
Nothing.

431
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:36,653
We talked about his wife,
his travels.

432
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,788
We talked for hours.

433
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,269
What's wrong?

434
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,504
Nothing.

435
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,343
I don't like him
coming here, Marisol.

436
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,513
What would you have me do?
I'm here on my own.

437
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,449
<i>I can't prevent him
from coming.</i>

438
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:17,494
Tomorrow, I think it's best
you come out there with me.

439
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,298
Isaac:
<i>You can stay if you like.</i>

440
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,501
Hoot'll start thinking
I have a boyfriend.

441
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,569
Don't worry yourself
about Hoot.

442
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:30,440
What about your father?

443
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,409
What about him?

444
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:36,446
You think he knows he's
sharing me with his own son?

445
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,582
You think you're something
fucking different

446
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,484
from them other whores
out there?

447
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,054
Do you? You think you're
something fucking special?

448
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:46,022
That it?

449
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,692
You fucking Biddie whore.

450
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:52,929
- ( choking )
- What happens between you and me

451
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,864
stays that way.

452
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,399
( gasps )

453
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,068
Get the fuck out of here!

454
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,751
Headed somewhere?

455
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,687
It's a beautiful day
for a ride.

456
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,589
That it is.

457
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,759
Thought we might go down and
take a good look at the river.

458
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,466
You'll enjoy that.
This is Naomi.

459
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:33,136
But I believe
you two already met.

460
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:38,541
Naomi, this is Marisol.

461
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,711
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

462
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,833
And you're even more
beautiful than I was told.

463
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:49,419
Abraham: <i>Just stopped by
to let you know</i>

464
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,888
I'll be holding a revival
at the chapel

465
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,524
<i>at 8:00 tomorrow morning.</i>

466
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:57,861
Naturally, you are more
than welcome to join us.

467
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,430
Thank you, Abraham.
We will consider it.

468
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:04,434
Very well, then.
We'll be on our way.

469
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,403
Enjoy your ride.

470
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,935
David?

471
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,939
Just stay there.

472
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,932
What's wrong?
What's happening?

473
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,935
Something's not right.

474
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,971
<i>- ( rain pattering )</i>
- Man:<i> It's my pleasure, ma'am.</i>

475
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,973
<i>You take good care now.</i>

476
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,314
I left corn cure
by the bed.

477
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:34,884
You're going to have to purchase
more from Portence in a day or two.

478
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,986
Is it the fever?

479
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,956
Bed rest, corn cure.

480
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:42,091
Keep her hydrated.

481
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,993
Otherwise,
just leave her be.

482
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,596
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

483
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:48,698
Thank you
for coming, Doctor.

484
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:54,671
He shall bless thy bread
and thy water

485
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:58,675
and He will take sickness
away from the midst of thee.

486
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:01,010
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

487
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,859
<i>- ( distant chanting )
- ( rooster crows )</i>

488
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,156
<i>( chanting continues )</i>

489
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:55,131
Abraham:
<i>God calls on you</i>

490
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,734
<i>to conquer your fear.</i>

491
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:06,209
( chanting continues )

492
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:09,412
Unshackle your faith.

493
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:15,385
The serpent is the darkness
inside your soul.

494
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,754
Your fear excites it.

495
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:21,991
Harness that fear

496
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,662
and embrace the power
within you.

497
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:30,433
<i>Fill yourself
with His spirit</i>

498
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,670
<i>and I will chase away
your demons.</i>

499
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:37,306
The spirit led you here.

500
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,876
You have nothing to fear.

501
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:44,113
Take it.

502
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,949
No, please.

503
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,052
Take it.

504
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,454
( hissing )

505
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,992
Behold...

506
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,395
your faith,

507
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,765
even as tiny
as a mustard seed,

508
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,834
<i>can move mountains.</i>

509
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:09,338
This is the message
from the son of God!

510
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,442
The miracles I do,
you can do also.

511
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:16,379
<i>The power of God
is within you!</i>

512
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,716
All that is required
is that you believe.

513
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:25,455
Let us pray.

514
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:28,958
<i>Lord, we welcome You
amongst us this morning.</i>

515
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,295
<i>We ask that You
open our hearts...</i>

516
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,800
Whoa, what happened?

517
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:40,470
Come on. Come on, sit down.
Come sit down.

518
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:43,840
The Englishman...
he's drunk.

519
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,743
I was entertaining him
and then he grabbed his gun

520
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,778
and he tried to put it
inside me and then...

521
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,081
Okay, it's all right.
Is he still there?

522
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,523
Okay, you don't move from
that chair until I return.

523
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:06,229
( men laughing )

524
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,464
Which one?

525
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,800
- Abraham handles these matters...
- Which fucking one?

526
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:12,401
Blue shirt in the corner.

527
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,042
Okay. Okay.

528
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,256
Really did a number
on you, Miss Naomi.

529
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:35,825
Who is he?
And the other two with him?

530
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:40,863
<i>Uh, they'd be guests
of Abraham.</i>

531
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:47,303
Not sure I'm going to have enough
thread to stitch the other fellow.

532
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,243
Where is he?

533
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,286
You have no idea
what's going on here.

534
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,822
Ah, for this?

535
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:08,491
She's not worth
a lick or a...

536
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,364
Abraham will not
be pleased by this.

537
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,000
You run
to your father, then.

538
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,203
( cocks gun )

539
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,010
My sense is he's taken quite
a shine to me being here.

540
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,545
You're mistaken.

541
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,581
It's that pretty
bean-eating wife of yours...

542
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,482
( gunshot )

543
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,396
( cocks gun )

544
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:51,000
What are you gonna do?
I ain't heeled.

545
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:59,375
( groaning )

546
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,118
Get him out of here.

547
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,554
( muttering )

548
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,024
Get off!

549
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:18,027
Not bad for the son
of a shop clerk.

550
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,530
Show's over, dear friends.

551
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:25,167
Morris,
please see to Isaac.

552
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,538
I'm taking my wife home.

553
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,674
You see to Naomi.

554
00:48:31,676 --> 00:48:35,144
I'll attend
to her every need.

555
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,690
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

556
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:51,193
"Corn cure and bed rest."

557
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:54,230
You heard it yourself.
Do you even wish to recover?

558
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,335
I never should have
let you come here.

559
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:07,410
What happened
to that woman?

560
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:10,246
She was beaten
in the brothel.

561
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:15,384
Is that why
you were fighting?

562
00:49:21,092 --> 00:49:24,160
Guess that what happens
to pretty whores.

563
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,069
- Do you think she's pretty?
- Stop it.

564
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,441
Abraham will take care
of her.

565
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,009
Will he?

566
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:41,577
He branded
that poor woman

567
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,112
when she tried
to leave this place...

568
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:44,513
- He wouldn't do that...
- Damn it, Marisol!

569
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,415
I saw it myself!

570
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:51,487
Why are you speaking
about him like you know him?

571
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,325
All right.
Hey.

572
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,128
Hey, it's all right,
it's all right.

573
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,329
It's all right.

574
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:07,236
<i>- ( piano music playing )</i>
- Isaac:<i> So easily you could have stopped him today.</i>

575
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:11,540
You stood by
while he beat me.

576
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,210
You might have
stopped him yourself.

577
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,615
You tolerate him
for his woman.

578
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:21,450
She's yours.

579
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,786
Take her and let's bury him.

580
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:31,761
If you could see
yourself...

581
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:37,066
turned weak
over a pretty Mexican.

582
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,570
You are
your mother's son.

583
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:47,610
Are you so ashamed?

584
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:51,247
Am I not as God
has made me to be?

585
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:55,484
God, maybe,

586
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,086
but not me.

587
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,272
You go ahead,
gentlemen.

588
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:19,508
I'll catch up
with you at Hoot's.

589
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,243
Morning.

590
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,648
More uninvited guests?

591
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,150
<i>( men speaking Chinese )</i>

592
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:32,188
Fascinating culture,
the Chinese.

593
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,326
They say they are
trapped in the Samsara,

594
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:41,864
ever-changing world
of good and evil.

595
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:47,837
If they don't take control
of their desires,

596
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,107
they are subject
to great suffering

597
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:54,743
in this life
and the next.

598
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:57,213
I didn't have the heart
to tell them

599
00:51:57,215 --> 00:52:00,583
that heathens be damned
to hell regardless.

600
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:04,820
What desires could
they possibly find out here?

601
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:10,392
You're feeling
off-color today.

602
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,197
Short time
I've been here,

603
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,435
I've seen Englishmen
and now Chinamen.

604
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:21,437
Curious, no?

605
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:26,375
And yet I haven't seen
a single Mexican man or woman.

606
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,410
We aren't but a few miles
from Mexico.

607
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,179
Why is that?

608
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,215
Perhaps they're scared.

609
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,718
Why would they be scared?

610
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:45,394
Because on this side
of the river,

611
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:48,297
they're no longer Mexican.

612
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:52,168
Not everybody possesses
our sensibilities, David.

613
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,910
There something more you feel the
need to ask me, Sheriff Locke?

614
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,484
I guess it don't matter.

615
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:11,487
Be leaving soon enough.

616
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,656
Will you?

617
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:16,292
Didn't find
what you were looking for?

618
00:53:16,294 --> 00:53:19,295
As soon as Marisol's fever
breaks, we'll be on our way.

619
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:21,664
Nowhere particular?

620
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:28,470
( speaking Latin )

621
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,808
What does that mean?

622
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:36,245
"I'll embrace your company
while I have it."

623
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,245
<i>( rain pattering )</i>

624
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:32,768
How long
have I been asleep?

625
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:39,441
Most of yesterday
and today.

626
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,932
I saw you
in the river.

627
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,359
It's the fever.

628
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:00,696
- It's made you delirious.
- You're not listening to me.

629
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,832
There's something
twisting in me.

630
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,068
Morris says
just a few days.

631
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,771
- Why are you not listening?
- Because you're not thinking straight.

632
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:13,342
No! I see it all
so clear.

633
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:16,679
You just took me

634
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,080
when he gave me away.

635
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:21,583
You never asked.

636
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:24,620
You think I'm crazy,
but I had no say in it.

637
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,755
All I think is that right now
you're not yourself.

638
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,857
You're very ill.

639
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:33,529
I need to see Abraham.

640
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,798
Can you send for him,
please?

641
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,499
- No.
- Please.

642
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,501
He's the only one
that can help us, David.

643
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:42,104
God damn it.
Help with what? How?

644
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:45,474
<i>You don't know Abraham.
You know me.</i>

645
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:48,110
And I'm right here.
I can help you.

646
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:51,013
He's put you in the river,

647
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,981
like he did to your father.

648
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,586
And you can't hear me.

649
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:03,392
<i>( frantic pounding
on door )</i>

650
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:07,629
<i>( pounding continues )</i>

651
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,367
I'm leaving.

652
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:24,646
I know you didn't just stumble
into town for no reason.

653
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,383
I can help you, but you
need to come with me.

654
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,884
Help me how?
What do you know?

655
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,387
Everyone here
knows what happens.

656
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,056
And they will kill you
when you least expect it.

657
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,557
- Just come in and talk...
- No.

658
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,926
Listen, your wife's
already gone.

659
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,796
- She was gone the moment you brought her here...
- That is enough of that.

660
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,865
Okay? I can protect you.
Just talk to me.

661
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:46,835
I have to go now. Ride to the first
ridge this side of the river.

662
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,971
You'll see what
you're looking for there.

663
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:51,173
I'll meet you
at the split-fork crossing.

664
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,175
I'll wait there
an hour for you.

665
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:55,778
Naomi, wh... Naomi!

666
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:59,415
God damn it.

667
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,496
Three miles?

668
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:09,117
( groaning )

669
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,902
Can you help me, please?

670
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:29,271
I need to see Abraham.

671
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:30,273
Abraham!

672
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:40,148
Abraham, help me.
Something's really wrong.

673
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,017
Where is your husband?

674
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,553
Last I seen, he was painting
his nose down at Hoot's

675
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:47,022
with that spud-nigger whore
Naomi.

676
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:02,571
Please, I don't know
what to do.

677
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:06,975
Silas, see she gets home and stay by
her side until the sheriff returns.

678
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:10,746
- Ladies, you fetch Dr. Morris.
- Yes.

679
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:13,248
If you were mine,
Marisol,

680
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,685
I'd not leave your side
for anything.

681
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,705
Why, I recall,

682
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:40,709
at Bull Run, I led my
militia through a wall

683
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:45,681
of advancing blue-belly
fire entirely unscathed.

684
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,684
- "How so?" one might ask.
- <i>( door opens )</i>

685
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:55,657
But, friends, this is
divine conviction at work.

686
00:59:55,659 --> 01:00:00,896
I tell you, we left even
General Lee speechless.

687
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:03,665
- ( men murmuring )
- You met General Lee?

688
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:09,371
Oh, it was a magnificent day
to behold.

689
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:13,075
My men killed
more Yankee malefactor

690
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:18,280
than that milksop Bedford
Forrest's entire regiment.

691
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:23,251
I believe he referred to us
as his "Hangman Militia."

692
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:25,787
( men laughing )

693
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:35,030
Did you kill
many men, Abraham?

694
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:43,238
The faces of those
we've killed

695
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,074
remains hidden

696
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,777
behind our eyes

697
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:52,981
and our memory
for eternity,

698
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,283
without change.

699
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:01,256
There's no labor
in killing a man.

700
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,793
But for some, it's living
after that's work.

701
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,831
You carry
the burden of many.

702
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,734
So should you.

703
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:15,904

My reflection

is clean.

It's okay, it's okay.
I'm here.

You're leaving me again.

719
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:38,987
I saw something
yesterday, Marisol.

720
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:55,537
We're leaving tonight.

The woman?

You are twisted,

There you are.

729

I mean, I must have picked the quickest
Mexican out of the whole bloody bunch.

Mine damn near
got to the river!

Monte said that's the farthest
any Mexican ever made it!

God damn it, that was
a hell of a time.

Everyone sit up.

01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,901
You and you, take everyone's
pistols and put them over there.

You killed my son.

How much?

795
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,890
200 a hunt.

796
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:24,959
$200 per hunt!

797
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,862
And that's
what you call it?

798
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:29,597
Hunting?

799
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:32,233

No, please.

01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,071
Why are you here,
old man?

801
01:14:39,209 --> 01:14:41,542
Because we wanted
to kill something.

Something or someone?

803
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:46,614
Someone.

We wanted to know what it
felt like to kill someone.

Well, I'm gonna
let you kill.

806
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:58,526
And I ain't even
gonna charge you for it.

807
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:12,640
You're gonna pick up
that pistol

808
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:16,277
and shoot Monte
in his ugly fucking face...

809
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,581
or I'm gonna
shoot your father dead.

810
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:26,888
In fact, go on
and shoot Dale, too.

811
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,990
I don't much
like his face either.

Don't do it, John.

Where is my wife?

824
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,825
Where she belongs.

825
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:19,033
You can go right ahead and put that
old coach gun down now, mister.

826
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,869
Aw, I figure I won't.

827

It's all right, boys.

828
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:28,743

Kingston?

831
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:38,753
I've known for quite some time
you'd be coming for me, David.

832
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:43,190
I took pleasure
in killing your father.

833
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:46,394
He was an abhorrent man.

834
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:50,431
If you think I'm here
to avenge my father,

835
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:53,167
you think too highly
of yourself.

836
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:57,171
<i>You're nothing more to me

837

Well, I must say

843
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:24,131
all this news
is shocking, David.

844
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,437
Though it seems you have
some bad information.

845
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,139
<i>You see,
we bury the bodies.</i>

846
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:36,277

How dirty did you get
that shovel today, Isaac?

Don't listen to him, Father.
You're a fucking liar.

850
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,393
I followed you today,
you piece of shit.

851
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:55,129
How long you think before
they find that scalpless girl

852
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:56,731
<i>you dumped in the river?</i>

853
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,501
Father, I...
I can explain.

854
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:03,938
Father, can't you...
can't you see what he's doing?

855
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,207
I tell you, he's...
he's lying.

856
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:10,311
You are as crippled
as your mother was.

857

( sighs )

858
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:26,927
I suppose I'll have to
try again with the new wife.

859
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,297
I'll shoot you dead before
you ever touch her again.

860
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:35,136
I have to say, as much as I
respect your confidence, David,

861
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:38,305
I also respect when a man
can appreciate

862
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:40,908
his fate staring him
in the face.

863
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:44,478
You have Hoot's rifle
pointing at your head, son.

864
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,015
I figure I'm a better
shot than Hoot.

865
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:10,337
Your pugnacious pappy
would have loved to hear that.

866
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:13,073
- Abraham?
- I say he's bluffing.

867
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:16,210
- Father, may I have a moment?
- No!

868
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,987
Isaac:
<i>David Kingston...</i>

869
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:34,261
I challenge you
to fight me to the death

870
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:36,964

871
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,173
My boy.

872
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,044
Let me do this, Pa.

873
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:00,921
Let me help you up, son.

874
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,260
David?

875
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:11,465
I'll do it
on one condition.

876
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:16,403
When it's done,
my wife leaves here with me.

877
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,575
Put your guns away,
gentlemen.

878
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:24,311
<i>There'll be
no more shooting today.</i>

879
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:39,627
Abraham:
We'll meet outside, 8:00.

880
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:56,577
Abraham:
<i>Good people of Mount Hermon,</i>

881
01:21:56,579 --> 01:22:01,181

882
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:03,517
Mr. Kingston.

883
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:12,126
A most noble affair

884
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:14,194
of character and honor.

885
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:21,402
I took David's father
with this knife

886
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,238
over 20 years ago.

887
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,174
The one he now grips
is stained with my blood

888
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:30,144
from that same duel

889
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:34,949
and now will surely
drip red with my son's.

890
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,621
<i>If Isaac lives,</i>

891
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:44,992
he will be forgiven
his ill-considered behavior

892
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:47,494
and he will undoubtedly
be the better man

893
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:50,230
for what he experiences
here tonight.

894
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:54,969
Does me proud.

895
01:22:57,974 --> 01:23:00,140
If David is victor,

896
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:04,378
<i>then in fairness,
he will be taken to his wife</i>

897
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,081
and she will decide
their fate.

898
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:11,085
On this, you have my word.
Gentlemen, come together.

899
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:20,494
You shall pour out
each other's blood...

900
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:25,132
and we will cover it
with dust.

901
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:43,117
Begin.

902
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:53,761
( groans )

903
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:07,775
- ( stabbing )
- Ah!

904
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:18,819
<i>( blood flowing )</i>

905
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,192
- Marisol?
- Shh.

906
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:04,631
You'll pull your stitches out
and bleed everywhere.

907
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:09,703
We can go home now.

908
01:25:25,588 --> 01:25:29,790
Abraham: <i>"Dark eyes burning,
in the night they glow.</i>

909
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,693
<i>She knows only yearning.</i>

910
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:35,829
<i>What else is there
to know?"</i>

911
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:38,599
That's beautiful, David.

912
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,704
And that's a lovely drawing.

913
01:25:43,706 --> 01:25:46,740
You are one surprise
after another.

914
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,548
You've been busy
when no one was watching.

915
01:25:57,386 --> 01:25:59,653
Thank you for sharing,
Marisol.

916
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:03,624
He wanted us to escape.

917
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:06,260
Abraham:
<i>Did he, now?</i>

918
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:12,232
Well, we're going to give you
that chance, David.

919
01:26:12,234 --> 01:26:15,169
These three men have yet
to experience

920
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,304
the thrill of the hunt.

921
01:26:17,306 --> 01:26:22,543
I've decided to afford them
this one unique opportunity.

922
01:26:22,545 --> 01:26:24,578
<i>Obviously,
you're disadvantaged,</i>

923
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,880
so we'll give you
till first light tomorrow.

924
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:29,716
The time until then
is yours.

925
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:34,254
<i>I've given you a rifle and a
generous amount of shells.</i>

926
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:35,722
Gentlemen?

927
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:49,536
Please get him
dressed and fed.

928
01:26:57,446 --> 01:26:59,379
( groaning )

929
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,920
Please put this on.

930
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,891
Marisol?

931
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:13,260
Why are you doing this?

932
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,271
Marisol?

933
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:27,307
<i>( footsteps recede )</i>

934
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,885
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

935
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,051
( snoring )

936
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:42,702
<i>( gunshot echoes )</i>

937
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:51,044
<i>( gunshot )</i>

938
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:56,716
( speaking Spanish )

939
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:27,214
You are not
from the town.

940
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:32,085
What is your name?

941
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:33,887
David Kingston.

942
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,990
I'm a ranger.

943
01:31:39,761 --> 01:31:41,995
I am Maria.

944
01:31:44,132 --> 01:31:46,833
Maria Calderon.

945
01:31:49,538 --> 01:31:51,938
Your uncle's
looking for you.

946
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:05,752
Thank you.

947
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:17,163
Best get on now,
Miss Calderon.

948
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:29,743
How do you know he
would've come this way?

949
01:32:29,745 --> 01:32:33,079
I've known where this boy's
been headed his entire life.

950
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:35,315
He was wounded something
fierce from the fight.

951
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:37,684
Probably dead
anyway.

952
01:32:37,686 --> 01:32:41,788
I assure you,
gentlemen, he is not.

953
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:44,190
Whoa, whoa.

954
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,539
- <i>( gunshot )</i>
- ( horse whinnies )

955
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:02,909
- Shit! Shit!
- <i>( gunfire )</i>

956
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,911
He ain't dead!
God damn it!

957
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:07,581
- Clem: <i>God damn it!</i>
- Silas:<i> Get your head down!</i>

958
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,785
- Hoot: <i>I knew it, I knew it.</i>
- Clem:<i> Shit!</i>

959
01:33:11,787 --> 01:33:13,467
Hoot:
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

960
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,592
What are we going
to do, Abraham?

961
01:33:18,594 --> 01:33:22,362
- ( gunshot )
- ( horses neighing )

962
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:23,930
Shit!
There goes the horses.

963
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:26,166
We gotta go back.
We can't stay here.

964
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:28,735
Please,
I... I can't fight.

965
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:30,203
I can't... I...

966
01:33:30,205 --> 01:33:32,205
( gagging )

967
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:34,107
( fires )

968
01:33:39,381 --> 01:33:41,247
( fires )

969
01:33:53,028 --> 01:33:54,761
( sighs )

970
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:12,338
( fires )

971
01:35:32,127 --> 01:35:34,294
( groans )

972
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,818
Oh! Ah!

973
01:36:00,188 --> 01:36:02,222
Ah!

974
01:36:47,903 --> 01:36:50,303
( groaning )

975
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:15,929
Ah, fuck.

976
01:37:28,376 --> 01:37:29,909
( grunting )

977
01:37:48,096 --> 01:37:49,295
( sighs )

978
01:37:49,297 --> 01:37:51,030
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

979
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:54,267
( groaning )

980
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:07,413
( groaning )

981
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,577
( gun cocks )

982
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:40,146
I'm guessing
you didn't foresee this.

983
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,100
( grunts )

984
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:06,439
You should thank me
for taking your father.

985
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:10,677
<i>You were born that day.</i>

986
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:15,982
<i>If he raised you, you would
not be the man you've become.</i>

987
01:39:15,984 --> 01:39:21,955
Our entire lives spent
denying death its dominion.

988
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,390
<i>Seems its answer
for us will be...</i>

989
01:39:24,392 --> 01:39:27,226
painful and slow.

990
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:32,131
We deserve it
for all we've done.

991
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:36,736
Futile to toil
over such things.

992
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:39,572
Forces you
to look inward

993
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:44,410
and examine
the monster you truly are.

994
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:49,248
Don't go exempting
yourself.

995
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:52,418
You'll answer the same
as everyone else.

996
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,654
David, I was never born

997
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:58,591
nor will I ever truly die.

998
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,595
Aw, you'll die, all right.

999
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:05,231
You'll die right here.

1000
01:40:06,434 --> 01:40:09,002
Your leg will swell.

1001
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:12,538
You'll scream and try to kill
yourself to save the pain.

1002
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:15,008
<i>The stench will lead them
to our bodies in a week</i>

1003
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:17,276
<i>and this scene will show
what I have made of you.</i>

1004
01:40:18,646 --> 01:40:21,748
Word will spread
of your death.

1005
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,784
They'll hiss your name,
call you a murderous son of a bitch

1006
01:40:24,786 --> 01:40:26,552
and a fraud.

1007
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:36,029
The only thing
they'll remember of you

1008
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:38,131
will be me.

1009
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:43,202
( chuckling )

1010
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:55,081
( grunting )

1011
01:41:06,194 --> 01:41:08,261
( screeching )

1012
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:17,804
( exhales )

1013
01:41:58,179 --> 01:41:59,579
<i>( stabbing echoes )</i>

1014
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:02,215
<i>( distant shouting )</i>

1015
01:42:07,355 --> 01:42:09,322
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

1016
01:42:09,324 --> 01:42:11,757

- ( stabbing )
- ( men shouting )

1018
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:22,135
( stabbing )

1019
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:32,812
Men:
Get him! Get him!

1020
01:42:35,383 --> 01:42:36,782
Yes!

1021
01:43:03,444 --> 01:43:05,411
Abraham:
<i>I made you.</i>

1022
01:43:06,581 --> 01:43:08,814
And so I end you.

1023
01:43:08,816 --> 01:43:11,350
( gunshot )

1024
01:43:50,925 --> 01:43:53,459
Calderon: You did send your rangers
out to the town

1025
01:43:53,461 --> 01:43:55,695
to corroborate the stories
that my niece gave you

1026
01:43:55,697 --> 01:43:57,630
along with the prisoners?

1027
01:43:57,632 --> 01:44:00,399
The... the town
was abandoned.

1028
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:02,335
And the prison?

1029
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:05,304
It doesn't appear
to exist.

1030
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:11,277
<i>Did your niece
say anything else</i>

1031
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,748
<i>regarding David Kingston
or his wife?</i>

1032
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:18,684
Calderon: <i>She said he was badly wounded
when he freed the prisoners</i>

1033
01:44:18,686 --> 01:44:23,289
<i>and he rode out
into the brush alone,</i>

1034
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:25,891
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

1035
01:44:25,893 --> 01:44:28,461
<i>But she made no mention
of a woman.</i>

1036
01:44:29,964 --> 01:44:32,365
Perhaps you will allow me
a small detail

1037
01:44:32,367 --> 01:44:33,833
<i>to go out
and search for him.</i>

1038
01:44:33,835 --> 01:44:36,469
I don't think so, General.

1039
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:40,640
He rode off into the brush
for a reason.

1040
01:44:40,642 --> 01:44:44,577
<i>If he wants to,
he'll ride back out again.</i>

1041
01:45:36,364 --> 01:45:38,597
<i>( music playing )</i>
