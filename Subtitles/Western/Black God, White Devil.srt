1
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,532
Rosa,
I saw Saint Sebastian.

2
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,603
He said a miracIe
wiII save the worId.

3
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:27,617
Many peopIe were foIIowing
aII singing and praying.

4
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,159
Nobody beIieves me.

5
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,992
But I saw him!

6
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,332
He Iooked deep
into my eyes.

7
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,838
It's a miracIe,
Rosa, a miracIe.

8
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:38,511
Rosa, on Saturday
I'II go to market.

9
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,810
Divide the cattIe
with Moraes.

10
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,156
Maybe I can seII two cows...

11
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,657
and buy a piece of Iand
from him.

12
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,846
If it works out we can pIant
something...

13
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:25,847
to harvest next year.

14
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,196
It's no use.

15
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:44,175
I don't know,
we've got to try.

16
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,539
Heaven might
send us a miracIe.

17
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:32,580
Yes, Rosa, maybe
there'II be a miracIe.

18
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,033
-Morning, Boss.
-Good Morning.

19
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,610
The cows are here,
but four of them are dead.

20
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,946
Did they drink water
from the North weII?

21
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,473
Yes sir, it was
the onIy pIace.

22
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,747
They were bitten
by snakes.

23
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,248
I brought tweIve cows.

24
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,862
Maybe we couId spIit
the Ioss.

25
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:27,633
There's nothing to spIit,
the dead cows were aII yours.

26
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:32,366
But Mr. Moraes the cows
had your brand on them.

27
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,499
They couIdn't be mine.
I'm a poor man.

28
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,610
It was an accident,
but it's true.

29
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,321
The snakes bit your cows.

30
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,951
Don't argue!
The Iaw is on my side.

31
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,204
Excuse me, Mr. Moraes
but what Iaw?

32
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,638
-Are you arguing with me?
-No, sir.

33
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,210
But what's this Iaw which
doesn't protect what's mine?

34
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,179
I've aIready toId you
, you're entitIed to nothing.

35
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,310
But Mr. Moraes...

36
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,647
-You can't take what's mine.
-Are you caIIing me a thief?.

37
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,342
You yourseIf are doing so!

38
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:10,258
My son,
your mother is dead.

39
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:20,432
not by God's hand.

40
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:32,278
By a mercenary's gun during...

41
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:41,793
a fight in the backIands.

42
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,983
I knew it, Rosa.

43
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,952
You didn't beIieve me...

44
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,189
but it was the hand of God
Ied me to the DeviI.

45
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,225
We'II have to go
to Monte Santo...

46
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,693
and ask for St. Sebastian's
protection.

47
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,904
Come on now...

48
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:03,364
we've nothing to take
with us but our destiny.

49
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,130
Was Don Pedro AIvares CabraI
discovered BraziI.

50
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,066
He had his cavaIry buiIt
of stone and bIood.

51
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,105
This piIgrimage
to Monte Santo...

52
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,941
wiII open
the gates of Heaven...

53
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,241
to the bodies and souIs
of the innocent.

54
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:10,642
I have waIked from
viIIage to viIIage...

55
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:15,480
teIIing everyone fire
wiII sprout from the rocks...

56
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,847
to burn the worId.

57
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,887
The Iords of this Iand...

58
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:26,158
the authorities
and the farmers...

59
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,661
they aII said I was Iying...

60
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:33,290
and that the sun wouId
be to bIame for this disaster.

61
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:40,005
Last year I said we'd have
100 days without rain...

62
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,675
and we had them!

63
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,978
Now I teII you...

64
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:51,116
On the other side
of this hoIy mountain...

65
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:56,521
there is a bountifuI Iand.

66
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,025
The horses eat flowers.

67
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:05,053
ChiIdren drink miIk
out of the rivers.

68
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,602
And rocks turn into bread.

69
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:15,274
Dust becomes flour.

70
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:20,412
There's water and food,
the abundance of Heaven.

71
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,483
And every day
when the sun rises...

72
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,720
Jesus Christ and the
Virgin can be seen...

73
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,392
and Saint George.
And my Saint Sebastian...

74
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,522
his chest bristIing
with arrows.

75
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,459
We must show
the authorities...

76
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,663
the power and force
of the Saint.

77
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,833
They removed Dom Pedro
from his throne,

78
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,470
and now try to kiII
those who Iove the Emperor.

79
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,973
But those who wish
to save their souIs...

80
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,609
must foIIow me
from now on...

81
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,780
untiI the day when God's sign
appears in the sky.

82
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,684
A hundred angeIs with
their swords of fire,

83
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,953
shaII come to heraId
our departure,

84
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,790
and open our way through
the darkness of the backIands.

85
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,092
The Iand wiII become the sea
and the sea the Iand.

86
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,767
A man shouIdn't be
another man's sIave.

87
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,637
He must Ieave the Iand
that doesn't beIong to him,

88
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,975
so that he can reach
the fieIds of Heaven.

89
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,177
The poor wiII be rich...

90
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,980
and wiII sit on
the right side of God.

91
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,949
The rich wiII be poor

92
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,753
and stand on the Ieft side
of the DeviI.

93
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:49,294
We shaII not be aIone,
because the Lord has sent down

94
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:56,501
warring angeI, to cut out
the heads of our enemies.

95
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,837
I'm condemned
but have courage.

96
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,774
I give my strength to my Saint
so he can free my peopIe.

97
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,971
The Lord be praised.

98
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,665
Do you stiII remember me?

99
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,841
I don't remember anything.

100
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,173
Neither the night
nor the day.

101
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,346
We Iived together.

102
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,852
Back on the farm.

103
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,157
We've been here in
Monte Santo for a Iong time.

104
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:37,242
You're foIIowing Sebastian
and you Ieft me behind.

105
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,245
I have to be aIone
to reach the Sacred IsIand.

106
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,078
I must Ieave behind
wife and chiIdren.

107
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:50,321
We'II stay one year
in Monte Santo...

108
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:54,225
waiting for
the rain of goId.

109
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:58,630
Then we'II go to an isIand
in the middIe of the sea...

110
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:06,104
and we'II Iet the fire from
the sky burn this...

111
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,334
RepubIic of disgrace,
once and for aII.

112
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,081
The IsIand doesn't exist.

113
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,852
We have it inside our souIs.

114
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,754
If it doesn't exist...

115
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,858
why must we search for it
aII our Iives?

116
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:31,462
You have come to be
my strength in peace and war.

117
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,828
You must fight for me.

118
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,845
The IsIand doesn't exist.
Yes it does.

119
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,747
I saw it at
the bottom of the river.

120
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,054
Sebastian said
the isIand doesn't exist...

121
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,556
and that we must
Iive in pain.

122
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,625
I was behind you.
I heard.

123
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,527
You're Iying.

124
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:07,565
You and aII the others
are faithIess and damned...

125
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:11,169
but I'm going
to survive and be king.

126
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,639
My cattIe wiII graze
in a green pasture.

127
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,641
That's a dream.

128
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:21,746
The earth is dry and
wiII never bear any fruit.

129
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,283
Why must you
be sick with hope?

130
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:31,756
Let us Ieave this pIace
and make a Iiving eIsewhere...

131
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,426
before the Army arrives...

132
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:39,260
and does the same
as they did in Canudos...

133
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:46,471
kiIIing men, women
and chiIdren.

134
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:49,274
If there is a war...

135
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:53,645
I'II fight a thousand soIdiers
with Saint George's spear.

136
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:59,817
If the peopIe of Santo die,
I'II create the isIand.

137
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,020
You shaII die.
I shaII die.

138
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,422
No one wiII escape.

139
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,186
Fate is greater than death.

140
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,750
There's goId
in the sea beyond.

141
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:40,391
Rocks turn into bread,
and horses eat flowers.

142
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,518
You waIk in the dark.

143
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:35,847
Lost in this dry worId

144
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:44,653
Under no God or DeviI

145
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:54,465
There goes Antonio
das Mortes

146
00:33:54,465 --> 00:34:02,736
The kiIIer of
the 'cangaceiro' highwaymen.

147
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,653
Since Sebastian came,
the church has earned nothing...

148
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,712
from christenings
and weddings.

149
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,427
Sebastian is dangerous
to both farmers...

150
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,371
and the church.

151
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,474
The Government
doesn't heIp us.

152
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:43,081
I aIways said
we have two Iaws here:

153
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:47,051
The Government Iaw,
and the Iaw of the buIIet.

154
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:50,179
I never won an eIection
through votes.

155
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:08,705
If the strong don't unite,
they'II destroy everything.

156
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:52,047
To kiII a 'cangaceiro'
is dangerous, but it's easy.

157
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,748
We aII remember Canudos.

158
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,335
The troops came
to fight ConseIheiro.

159
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,837
We aII thought it'd
be chiId's pIay...

160
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,067
and Iook what happened.

161
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:26,384
We mustn't Iet Sebastian
become another ConseIheiro.

162
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:30,946
PersonaIIy,
I'm not afraid of wars.

163
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,593
I've aIways
Iived with them.

164
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:42,099
But you know it's dangerous
to interfere in hoIy matters.

165
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,302
Sebastian is a
nenemy of the church.

166
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,964
But the peopIe around
him are Christians.

167
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,408
I haven't seen for myseIf...

168
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:54,276
but apparentIy
he can work miracIes.

169
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,071
WeII now.

170
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:06,123
OnIy you can do it.

171
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:12,630
We'II give you 300 contos
to rid us of the beatified.

172
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,863
Christ drove moneyIenders
out of His tempIe with a whip.

173
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,133
The exampIe is in the GospeI.

174
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,481
So, Antonio?
Do you accept?

175
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:42,252
300 Contos.
It's a Iot of money.

176
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:48,125
It's a smaII price
to pay to get into HeII.

177
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:08,386
The priest thinks Sebastian
has a pact with the deviI.

178
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,287
But I think he has
a pact with God, too.

179
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,918
Then you must Ieave here.

180
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:46,220
Buy a farm, and Iive in peace
for the rest of your Iife.

181
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,722
This is your penitence,
Antonio.

182
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:21,125
It is onIy when you commit
a great crime...

183
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:26,427
that you may be forgiven
for the crimes you committed.

184
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,238
600 contos.

185
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:10,498
That's twice what
they offered you before.

186
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,729
TeII them they can
Iive in peace.

187
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,254
Sebastian is finished.

188
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:58,051
From here I can see the sea,
and then the Promised Land.

189
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,795
God separated
the earth from the sky.

190
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,065
But he was wrong.

191
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,100
When I put
them back together...

192
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,761
the isIand wiII
be visibIe to aII.

193
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,391
There wiII be happiness,
Rosa.

194
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,767
After the backIands,
the sea!

195
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:37,244
You must choose.

196
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,123
Go down there.

197
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:43,326
Bring your wife
and a chiId.

198
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:49,754
OnIy after Rosa's souI is
washed, wiII you be cIean.

199
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:11,521
To govern the isIand,
to govern the isIand.

200
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:16,220
My wife has the deviI
in her!

201
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:26,203
Tomorrow goIden rain
wiII faII.

202
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,262
The Iand wiII
become the sea...

203
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:35,334
and the sea wiII become
the Iand!

204
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,661
When we get
to the isIand...

205
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,797
we'II cIean the souIs
of the sinners...

206
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,630
with the bIood
of the innocent.
