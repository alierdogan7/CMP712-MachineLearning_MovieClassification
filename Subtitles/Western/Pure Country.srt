he was putting the needle on the record.

And with his other, he was turning
on the stove underneath the stage.

just hop off the stage?

- Why didn't you call me?

331

could've been backstage with me.

Tell you the truth, Grandma Ivy,
I'm pretty worried about him.

685
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,196
He took off and...

686
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:14,452
He's got all this pressure and people just
trying to get a piece of him, you know.

687

It ain't surprising.

688
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,380
But this one's different.
He missed a show and...

- That just ain't like him.
- Well, sometimes...

692

of that tree to let the roots catch up.

693

- No.

roots, you'll find him.

from knocking down my door.

That's pretty smart.

Yeah, but I think you're
forgetting a little something.

1022
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:35,103
- Like what?
- Like a little matter of fraud.

1023
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:39,855
That fraud you been committing
on 60,000 unsuspecting fans.

1024

Especially when Lula here offers you all
that money and a recording contract.

Come to think of it...

1026
01:37:46,736 --> 01:37:49,910
- ...I think that qualifies as extortion too.
- What?

1027
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:53,668
Of course the only person who'd
have to press charges is me.

1028
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:56,124
- Wait. She didn't give me any money.
- DUSTY: What?

1029
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:00,675
- You mean you've been lying to the press?
- Hold on, Dusty.

1030
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:04,838
No, you hold on. I want
you to disappear, Buddy.

another comment to the press...

around country music again...

1033

won't believe it. Now go on.
