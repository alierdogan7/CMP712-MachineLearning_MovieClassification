1
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,280
TATANKA MADE US WHAT WE ARE:

2
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,960
A BUFFALO NATION.

3
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,770
SO LONG AS THE BUFFALO RAN,

4
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,890
OUR NATION WAS STRONG.

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,680
FROM TATANKA WE TOOK OUR FOOD,OUR CLOTHING,

6
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,520
OUR SHELTER...

7
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,170
THEN THE WHITES CAME AND BROUGHT STRANGE

8
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,910
NEW THINGS WITH THEM.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,820
THEY TRADED WITH OUR ENEMIES
THE CROW AND OTHER TRIBES.

10
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,890
WE LAKOTA TRADED LITTLE WITH THE WHITES.

11
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,920
THIS CAUSED ANGER AMONG SOME OF US.

12
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,010
OUR RIVALS ARE GAINING ADVANTAGE OVER THE LAKATA

13
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,090
BY TRADING WITH WHITES

14
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,050
WE MUST GO TO THEIR FORT

15
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,810
WHERE MUCH TRADE TAKES PLACE

16
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,280
PERHAPS MY OLDER BROTHER SEES THE WISDOM

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,460
OF THIS NEW HUNTING GROUND

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,970
THE WHITE MAN'S ROAD IS GOOG FOR THE WHITE MAN

19
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,500
BUT LAKOTA WAYS ARE GOD-GIVEN

20
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,050
WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN THE CROW AND CHEYENNE

21
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,510
COME WITH NEW RIFILES?

22
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,330
YOU WILL DIE

23
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,220
AND THEY WILL HAVE YOUR WOMEN AND CHILDREN

24
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,150
NO

25
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,570
I WILL TRUST THE GREAT SPIRIT

26
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,630
AND FIGHT WITH LANCE AND ARROW

27
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,090
WE MUST BE MORE LIKE WHITES

28
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,420
IF WE ARE TO RESIST THE WHITES!

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,310
AND WHAT GOOD IS RESISTING
IF WE HAVE ALREADY LOST OURSELVES?

30
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,630
I HAVE LOST NOTHING!I SPEAK
AS I DO TO SAVE OUR PEOPLE!

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,900
YOUR VOICE IS THE VOICE OF DEATH!

32
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,110
BAHAVE YOUSELVES!

33
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,370
I BELIEVE THE GREAT SPIRIT IS WITH US

34
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,610
IF WE BECOME WHITE

35
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,810
SO THAT WE CAN COOK IN IRON POTS

36
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,620
WE WILL LOSE OUR WAY

37
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,880
I WILL GO TO THE WHITES WITH MY CLAN

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,210
AND YOU WILL SEE HOW OUR PEOPLE CAN THRIVE

39
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,830
I HAVE PASSED MANY JOYOUS YEARS
AMONG THUNDER HEART WOMAN'S PEOPLE,

40
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,390
BUT WITH THE START OF MY OWN FAMILY,

41
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,420
I FELT A STRONG YEARNING

42
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,680
TO RETURN TO THE PLACE OF MY BIRTH,

43
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,500
SO THAT OUR DAUGHTER MARGARET LIGHT SHINES

44
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,180
WOULD KNOW SOMETHING OF HER FATHER'S WORLD.

45
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,810
JUST WHO MIGHT YOU BE?

46
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,980
THIS IS THE WHEELER HOUSE,IS IT NOT?

47
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,150
WE DON'T KNOW ANY INDIANS.

48
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,710
ARE YOU COUSIN RACHEL,

49
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,920
THE DAUGHTER OF BENJAMIN AND ABIGAIL WHEELER?

50
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,770
I'M NAOMI,RACHEL'S YOUNGER SISTER.

51
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,320
MY GOD.

52
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,600
I THOUGHT YOU WERE STILL A CHILD.

53
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,440
I'M JACOB.

54
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,640
YOUR FATHER'S MY UNCLE.

55
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,080
WE'RE COUSINS!

56
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,800
THIS IS MY FAMILY.

57
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,020
WELL,I'LL BE.

58
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,410
WE HEARD FROM NATHAN,A LETTER...

59
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,810
HE'S IN TEXAS.

60
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,340
HE'S MARRIED TO... A MEXICAN.

61
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,400
WELL,TEXAS IS GETTING SETTLED NOW,

62
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,340
THANKS TO FOLKS LIKE NATHAN.

63
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,860
BE PROUD OF NATHAN,MOTHER.

64
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,320
HE HELPED WHIP SANTA ANNA.

65
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,400
I JUST WISH HE'D COME BACK HOME,

66
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,740
EVEN IF IT'S JUST TO VISIT.

67
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,810
WOULD IT BE PROPER IF MY WIFE WERE
TO TAKE HIS SEAT FOR NOW?

68
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,700
OH,YES. YES,OF COURSE,

69
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,470
AND LIGHT SHINES BESIDE YOU.

70
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,790
WHAT'S THAT?

71
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,250
THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL GIFT FROM MY BRIDE.

72
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,140
LORD,YOU HAVE BLESSED US THIS DAY

73
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,270
WITH THE RETURN OF MY SON JACOB.

74
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,320
THANK YOU,LORD,AND PERHAPS SOMEDAY

75
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,140
YOU WILL GUIDE OUR OTHER LOST CHILD NATHAN TO US

76
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,470
SO THAT HE CAN BE AT THIS TABLE WITH US

77
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,200
SO WE CAN ALL BREAK BREAD AS A FAMILY ONCE AGAIN.

78
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,990
AMEN.

79
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,110
AMEN. AMEN. AMEN.

80
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,450
UH,HERE YA ARE,WAKIN-YAN-TECHATE...

81
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,440
WAKI-YAN-TECHANTEWYN.

82
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,650
IT TRANSLATES AS THUNDER HEART WOMAN.

83
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,950
WHAT IS IT YOU INTEND TO DO,JACOB?

84
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,780
WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE.

85
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,120
WHAT WE ALL DO,BE A WHEELWRIGHT.

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,010
THAT IS,IF YOU'LL ALLOW ME,FATHER.

87
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,000
OF COURSE I'LL ALLOW YOU.

88
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,370
BUSINESS ISN'T AS IT WAS,

89
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,290
BANK FAILURES AND ALL.

90
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,620
PEOPLE BARTER FOR SERVICES NOWADAYS,

91
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,840
BUT WE'LL GET BY.

92
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,870
BUNK HERE UNTIL THINGS TURN FOR THE BETTER.

93
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,540
YOUR SQUAW FEEL THE SAME?

94
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,870
NOW DON'T CALL HER MY SQUAW.SHE'S MY WIFE.

95
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,360
MY WOMAN,MY MISSUS.

96
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,130
THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' DIRTY ABOUT IT.

97
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,320
I LIVED WITH HER PEOPLE,HUNTED BUFFALO WITH THEM.

98
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,810
I LEARNED TO HONOR THEIR WAYS.

99
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,160
THEY MADE ME ONE OF THEIR SACRED OWN.

100
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,270
I HOPE YOU'LL DO THE SAME FOR HER.

101
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,320
WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

102
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,230
IT MAY TAKE TIME.

103
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,740
IT'S A BOY.

104
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,640
SHE DIDN'T CRY OUT,NOT A BIT.

105
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

106
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,450
LEAH,INDIANS AREN'T HUMAN.

107
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,110
THEY DON'T FEEL PAIN LIKE WE DO.

108
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
THEY'RE HEATHENS.

109
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,370
I WILL NAME HIM AFTER GRANDFATHER...

110
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,220
ABRAHAM.

111
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,510
AND HIS INDIAN NAME WILL BE "HIGH WOLF."

112
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,330
ONE THING I CAN'T GET OUT OF MY HEAD
ARE THOSE CALIFORNIA ORANGES.

113
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,550
THIS BIG. BRIGHT AND SHINY,GROW EVERYWHERE.

114
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,950
BOY,I MISS THEM.

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,550
THEN WHY'D YOU COME HOME?

116
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,470
OH,MEXICANS PUSHED US OUT,

117
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,530
BUT PEOPLE ARE PUSHING BACK.

118
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,570
JUST LIKE TEXAS,

119
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,710
CALIFORNIA'S LIKE A VIRGIN LOOKIN' FOR A HUSBAND.

120
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,690
IT'S GONNA DRAW FOLKS,

121
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,590
NO MATTER WHAT THE DONS SAY OR DO.

122
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,510
COULD BE A POSITIVE THING FOR A MAN,

123
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,250
TO BE A PART OF IT ALL,HELP SETTLE THE COUNTRY.

124
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,420
LOOK AT BROTHER NATHAN. HE STUCK IT OUT IN TEXAS.

125
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,890
NOW HE'S GOT A FARM,RAISIN' A FAMILY.

126
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,620
HE DIDN'T COME BACK HOME,

127
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,160
TAIL TUCKED BETWEEN HIS LEGS.

128
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,530
YOU KNOW,I CAME CLOSE
TO LOSIN' MY SCALP A NUMBER OF TIMES.

129
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,690
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MR. JEDEDIAH SMITH

130
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,730
OR A MAN NAMED FLETCHER...

131
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,820
HE THE ONE THAT CAME HERE THAT DAY,

132
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,300
WANTED HIS RIFLE-COCK REPLACED?

133
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,840
THAT'S HIM. STOOD RIGHT OVER THERE.

134
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,510
HE'S DEAD NOW.

135
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,020
TALKED ABOUT GOLD AND FORTUNES.

136
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,270
I REMEMBER.

137
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,710
NOW HE'S GONE.

138
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,000
SO MUCH FOR DREAMS OF GLORY.

139
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,910
THAT KIND OF LIFE,IT ALWAYS CARRIES A PRICE.

140
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,000
NOTHIN' COMES EASY,

141
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,200
BUT MR. SMITH IS NOT DEAD.

142
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,580
HE'S OUT THERE BLAZIN' TRAILS,

143
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,450
MAKIN' A NAME FOR HIMSELF.

144
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,730
PLENTY OF GLORY GOIN' AROUND OUT THERE,

145
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,860
AND HE DESERVES MOST OF IT.

146
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,190
GREATEST MAN I EVER MET.

147
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,590
HIDES? PELTS? GOT TOO MANY OF 'EM ALREADY.

148
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,820
GOT SOMETHIN' WE CAN USE?

149
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,360
ANY OF THOSE YOU'RE WILLING TO BARTER?

150
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,400
'CAUSE THERE'S A LOT
OF LONELY BOYS HEADIN' WEST.

151
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,780
THERE'S NO PREACHERS OR HIGH-FALUTIN' WOMEN

152
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,510
TO TELL 'EM A MAN'S PLEASURE AIN'T RIGHT.

153
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,350
UNDERSTAND?

154
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,920
'COURSE YOU DO.

155
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,200
JACOB! JACOB,LOOK HERE,JACOB...

156

164
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,710
HE WAS LEADING A PARTY ON THE CUTOFF TO SANTA FE.

165
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,880
THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY'S COMANCHE TERRITORY.

166
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,710
HE KNEW THAT.

167
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,420
HE CUT SIGN WITH THE BEST OF THEM.

WELL,HE WAS A GOD-FEARING MAN.

170
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,120
HE WAS A MODEST MAN.

171
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,010
SAVED MY LIFE UP IN A CAVE IN UTAH.

172
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,940
THE MOJAVE HAD SURROUNDED US.

173
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,200
THINGS WERE AT THEIR BLEAKEST

174
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,070
AND IT LOOKED LIKE THE SUN WOULD WASH OUR BONES

175
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,570
AND HE...

176
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,700
KEPT US GOIN' AND HE KEPT ME BELIEVIN'.

177
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,940
NOW HE'S DEAD.

178
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,530
HE WANTED ME TO STAY OUT WEST.

179
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,340
SAID IF I DIDN'T I'D NEVER KNOW
THE MAN I COULD HAVE BEEN

180
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,310
THE MAN GOD WANTED ME TO BE.

181
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,800
WHEELERTON'S GONE STALE.

182
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,050
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S THE DARE OF IT ALL.

183
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,970
BESIDES,I DON'T LIKE HOW THEY TREAT YOU...

184
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,380
OR YOUNG MARGARET LIGHT SHINES.

185
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,150
IT'S NOT LIKE FAMILY.

186
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
THEY WILL GROW ACCUSTOMED TO US.

187
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,620
A MAN EXPECTS MORE FROM FAMILY.

188
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,260
I WANT BACK WEST.

189
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,920
IT WILL BE HARD FOR THE CHILDREN.

190
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,400
WE'LL GO IN SLOW,EASY STAGES.

191
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,490
THIS IS YOUR HOME. VIRGINIA'S YOUR PEOPLE.

192
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,520
A MAN DON'T MAKE HISTORY

193
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,300
BY SLEEPIN' IN THE SAME BUNK HE WAS BORN IN.

194
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,060
HISTORY?

195
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,700
AND TAKIN' YOUR BROTHER WITH YOU.

196
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,370
TOOK NATHAN LAST TIME.

197
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,660
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIDE OR HAIR OF HIM SINCE.

198
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,070
I'M GOIN' BECAUSE I WISH TO.

199
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,420
I HAD A CHANCE BEFORE AND I DIDN'T GO.

200
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,530
I WON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

201
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,250
DON'T EXPECT TO COME BACK IN GOOD TIMES

202
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,520
AND GET A PIECE OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

203
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,680
THAT GOES TO THEM THAT WORKS IT.

204
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,430
THAT'S UNDERSTOOD.

205
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,570
BYE.

206
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,890
I JUST WANTED TO HOLD THE BABY
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

207
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,960
THAT'S WHAT COMES OF MARRYIN' INDIANS:

208
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,280
LONGIN' FOR THE WILDS.

209
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,220
LET'S GO,JETHRO.

210
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,070
PA...

211
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,650
THANK YOU,MOTHER.

212
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,270
JACOB,WAIT FOR ME!

213
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,610
WAIT!

214
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,290
WHO'S THAT?!

215
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,790
RACHEL!

216
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,730
COME TO SAY GOOD-BYE?!

217
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,600
I'M GOIN' WITH YOU!

218
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,940
THERE'S NOTHIN' FOR US HERE,

219
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,360
NOTHIN' FOR ANY OF US,

220
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,910
AND WE CAN HELP WITH THE CHILDREN.

221
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,450
WELL,WHO'S WE?

222
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,710
NAOMI'S FIANCE WENT AND MARRIED SOMEONE ELSE.

223
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,230
SHE WANTS TO DISAPPEAR FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

224
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,990
WE FIGURE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOIN'.

225
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,910
IS THAT LEAH COMIN' WITH HER?

226
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,450
SHE WANTS TO DISAPPEAR,TOO.

227
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,360
TRY AS I MIGHT,

228
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,500
MY IMPETUOUS COUSINS

229
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,020
COULD NOT BE MADE TO RECONSIDER.

230
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,990
I WROTE TO MA AND PA

231
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,410
TO EXPLAIN THINGS,BUT KNEW I LEFT THEM BEREFT.

232
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,050
I HOPED THAT I WOULD PROVE EQUAL

233
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,610
TO THE RESPONSIBILITY I HAD UNDERTAKEN.

234
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,440
STOP!

235
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,250
THE HERD IS OURS

236
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,170
IS THIS THE LAND OF THE LAKOTA?

237
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,980
I SPEAK OF THE HERD.

238
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,760
NOT THE LAND

239
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,410
YOU SPEAK FOOLISHNESS

240
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,360
IT'S BUFFALO WE WANT

241
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,480
UP THERE!

242
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,640
CROW!

243
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,380
OVER THERE TOO!

244
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,360
STOP!

245
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,470
THE SEEK THE SAME HERD

246
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,320
AND THEY HAVE MANY MORE RIFILES

247
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,540
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

248
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,390
WE CAN ALSO GET RIFILES.

249
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,880
8 MUSKETS FOR 4 PONIES.

250
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,370
8...

251
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,410
FOR 4...

252
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,130
OUR JOURNEY FROM VIRGINIA TO INDEPENDENCE

253
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,060
TOOK 3 YEARS.

254
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,920
LIKE MOST OTHER FOLKS
IN THE RESTLESS YOUNG AMERICA,

255
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,920
WE STOPPED AND SETTLED FOR A WHILE,

256
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,130
WORKED,THEN PUSHED ON AGAIN.

257
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,810
HOUSES WERE BUILT THEN ABANDONED

258
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,850
BEFORE THE TREES CAME INTO BERRY.

259
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,200
FIELDS WERE PLANTED,

260
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,770
THEN LEFT FOR OTHERS TO REAP THE HARVEST.

261
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,890
ON THE WAY,WE HAD ANOTHER CHILD,A BOY,

262
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,780
JACOB JR.

263
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,160
INTO THE DEEP

264
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,910
BLUE CLEAR WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

265
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,690
WELCOME,FRIENDS!

266
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,040
IS IT THE GOLDEN COAST YOU SEEK?

267
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,360
THE SHANGRI-LA OF THE WEST?

268
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,340
CALIFORN-EYE-AYE?

269
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,860
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?

270
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,390
NO,NO,CAN'T SAY AS I HAVE.

271
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,950
WELL,I'VE BEEN. I'VE SEEN.

272
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,220
AND WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT?

273
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,130
BY COMPARISON,EVERYTHING ELSE IS A DUNG HEAP.

274
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,630
WELL PUT! WE'RE IN AGREEMENT,SIR!

275
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,650
WELCOME! WE CAN USE A MAN
WHO'S BEEN DOWN THAT TRAIL.

276
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,140
WE HAVE CLOSE TO THE MAKINGS OF A TRAIN HERE.

277
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,440
DON'T WANT TOO BIG A COMPANY.

278
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,480
WE WISH TO TRAVEL LIGHT AND FAST.

279
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,510
AND SAFE?

280
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,250
YES,SIR!

281
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,190
THAT'S IT,EXACTLY.

282
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,740
SIGN UP. CONTRACT'S THERE.

283
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,000
LIST YOUR MEMBERS,YOUR INTENTIONS,

284
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,190
EQUIPMENT,SKILLS.

285
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,570
YOU ACCEPT FREE MEN OF COLOR?

286
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,890
WHERE ARE YOU FROM,SIR?

287
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,390
ILLINOIS.

288
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,580
THEY LOVE US AS A RACE THERE,

289
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,040
BUT HATE US AS PEOPLE.

290
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,820
WE'RE HEADIN' WEST FOR ACCEPTANCE.

291
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,420
JOIN US.

292
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,910
YOU JOINING THIS TRAIN,MISTER?

293
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,480
I'M THINKING ON IT.

294
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,290
THERE'S A LOT OF RULES
AND REGULATIONS HERE,MISTER.

295
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,610
HOXIE'S THE NAME. STEPHEN HOXIE.

296
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,470
I'M PROVIDING WAGONS,HORSES,CATTLE,STORES,

297
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,980
AND DOING THAT I FIGURE TO CAPTAIN THIS TRAIN.

298
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,760
NOT TO PILOT,MIND YOU.

299
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,010
NOT OUR GUIDE.

300
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,130
BUT THE MAN IN CHARGE?

301
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,880
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE.

302
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,420
MIGHT AS WELL BE THE FELLOW
WHO CAN PROVIDE FOR ALL.

303
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,720
A WAGON TRAIN IS LIKE A PASSENGER SHIP

304
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,660
ON A LONELY PRAIRIE OCEAN.

305
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,090
ALWAYS A CAPTAIN ON THE SHIP.

306
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,640
WE NEED RULES,STANDARDS,

307
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,510
ORGANIZATION,YOUNG MAN.

308
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,280
EVERYONE NEEDS A TASK.

309
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,540
JETHRO,THEY GOT A MEMBER'S COUNCIL.

310
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,930
"REPORT TO CAPTAIN."

311
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,310
$10 TAX PER PERSON?

312
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,750
MORAL CLAUSE?

313
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,210
AS THE SAYING GOES,

314
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,010
WHEN ALIEN PEOPLES MEET,FIRST THEY FIGHT,

315
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,820
AND THEN THEY FORNICATE.

316
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,490
WE NEED TO PRESERVE
OUR DIGNITY OUR CIVILIZED WAYS.

317
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,680
CAN'T LET SAVAGERY INFECT US.

318
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,010
WE INTEND TO SIT OUT THE RAINS,

319
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,730
DEPART COME SPRING.

320
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,890
THAT WAY WE BEAT WINTER IN THE SIERRAS.

321
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,000
WELL,COME SEE ME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

322
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,240
AT COLONEL NOLAN'S HOTEL AND TAVERN.

323
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,540
WHAT ABOUT MISSOURI?

324
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,380
WE'RE IN MISSOURI.

325
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,300
THE LAND IS RICH.

326
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,200
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE,

327
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,220
FARMS,SETTLEMENTS.

328
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,880
WHY NOT STAY HERE?

329
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,660
IT'S SWAMP COUNTRY.

330
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,140
MALARIA,PESTILENCE. DON'T WANT IT,DON'T NEED IT.

331
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,480
NO FEVER IN CALIFORNIA.

332
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,760
I HEARD ONE FELLA TALKIN',

333
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,210
SAID FOLKS ROUTINELY LIVE
150,200 YEARS IN CALIFORNIA,

334
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,000
THE CLIMATE'S SO GOOD.

335
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,830
FALDERAL.

336
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,960
NOBODY CAN LIVE THAT LONG.

337
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,690
ONE OLD COOT,THEY SAY,WAS 250 YEARS OLD.

338
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,940
AND HE PLUM HAD ENOUGH DECIDED HE WANTED TO DIE.

339
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,980
WHAT'D THEY DO,FEED HIM MEXICAN FOOD?

340
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,190
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR OREGON.

341
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,050
I MEAN,AT LEAST THEY SPEAK ENGLISH.

342
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,990
TRUE.

343
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,490
WHO'S GONNA TALK SPANIARD

344
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,150
WHEN WE GET TO CALIFORNIA?

345
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,570
YOU,JACOB?

346
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,610
THOSE DONS ARE EDUCATED. THEY SPEAK ENGLISH.

347
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,630
CALIFORNIA OR BUST.

348
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,610
DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE A COOPERSMITH.

349
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,340
WE'RE OBLIGED TO THE PROPRIETOR

350
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,010
FOR LETTIN' US USE THE SHOP.

351
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,800
MAKE ANOTHER WAGON FOR THE JOURNEY.

352
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,640
WE'RE WHEELWRIGHTS. THAT'S MY BROTHER JETHRO.

353
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,220
NEXT TO PILOTS AND INDIAN FIGHTERS,

354
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,240
THERE'S FEW THINGS AS CRUCIAL
TO THE SUCCESS OF A TRAIN

355
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,800
AS A SKILLED WHEELWRIGHT.

356
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,480
YOU HADN'T COME BY NOLAND'S.

357
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,430
WE INTEND TO LEAVE IN A MATTER OF DAYS.

358
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,860
HOW MANY WAGONS?

359
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,280
18.

360
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,350
I'VE HIRED A PILOT NAMED JOSIAH BELL.

361
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,150
HE RAN WITH FITZPATRICK
TRAPPING BEAVER,FIGHTING INDIANS.

362
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,750
HE'S BEEN EVERYWHERE. HE'S GOT 2 SCOUTS WITH HIM.

363
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,530
INCLUDING THE OTHERS,WE HAVE 22 ARMED MEN.

364
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,510
OH,YEAH? HORSES OR OXEN?

365
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,750
HORSES AND MULES.

366
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,420
THINK THOSE WHEELS CAN HANDLE THE TRAIL?

367
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,770
I EXPECT SO.

368
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,730
IRON TIRES,2 AND A HALF INCHES,BOLTED.

369
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,980
WELL,THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL WAGON.

370
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,630
CONESTOGA,WE CALL IT.

371
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,820
WELL-SEASONED WOOD,FALLING TONGUES,

372
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,000
WELL-STEELED SKEINS.

373
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,350
WHAT ABOUT EXTRA AXLES?

374
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,100
CAN'T DO WITHOUT 'EM.

375
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,900
TIRES BUCKLE,WAGON TONGUES SNAP,FRONT AXLES FAIL.

376
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,020
THE LOWER HALF OF THE WAGON,MR. HOXIE,

377
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,020
THAT'S WHERE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS ALL.

378
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,690
THE RUNNING GEAR,WE CALL IT.

379
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,760
WE CAN SURE USE FOLKS LIKE YOU ON THIS JOURNEY.

380
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,610
I GOT A PART-TIME COOPERSMITH,

381
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,730
AND A HALF-ASSED WAINWRIGHT,

382
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,850
BUT NO WHEELWRIGHT.

383
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,740
WELL,WE SURE WOULD LOVE TO COME,

384
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,920
ONLY WE DON'T HAVE $80.

385
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,160
I'LL LOAN YOU.

386
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,270
WON'T BE INDEBTED,EITHER.

387
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,330
THEN WHAT?

388
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,420
WELL,YOU PAY FOR THE EXTRA AXLES,SPOKES,

389
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,430
AND TONGUES AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT.

390
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,770
ME AND JETHRO'S LABOR FOR THE JOURNEY

391
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,830
WILL COME TO ABOUT $80,I RECKON.

392
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,030
DON'T YOU FIGURE,JETHRO?

393
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,350
RIGHT ABOUT 80,BROTHER.

394
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,530
YES,SIR.

395
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,570
AND SO,THE WHEELER PARTY
ROLLED OUT OF INDEPENDENCE,

396
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,720
HEADING WEST,NORTHWEST ON HOXIE'S TRAIN.

397
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,570
WAGON-MASTER HOXIE WAS
A REGULAR NAPOLEON OF THE PLAINS

398
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,340
WANTED EVERYBODY TO CALL HIM CAPTAIN,

399
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,590
EVEN THOUGH HE'D NEVER BEEN NEAR A UNIFORM.

400
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,890
HIS HIRED PILOT WAS A FRONTIERSMAN
BY THE NAME OF JOSIAH BELL,

401
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,420
AND THERE WERE 2 SCOUTS NAMED MEEKS AND SKATE.

402
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,850
BONNETS.

403
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,990
I'D SEEN THEIR KIND BEFORE.

404
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,060
ROUGH-HEWN BOYS,CHAWBACONS,

405
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,140
COME WEST NOT FOR ADVENTURE
OR RICHES OR EXPLORATION,

406
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,640
BUT FOR WOMEN AND WHISKEY.

407
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,420
AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT THEY WERE RUNNING FROM.

408
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,410
WITH US WAS HOBBES,A GERMAN PREACHER

409
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,690
WHO CLAIMED ALSO TO BE A DOCTOR.

410
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,510
HE LED US IN PRAYER
WHEN WE DEPARTED INDEPENDENCE,

411
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,840
ASKING THE LORD'S GUIDANCE
AND PROTECTION FROM DISEASE,

412
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,380
ACCIDENTS,BEASTS OF PREY,AND WILD HEATHENS.

413
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,320
WHEN HE SAID THE LAST HE WAS
STARING STRAIGHT AT THUNDER HEART WOMAN.

414
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,780
SHE DIDN'T PAY HIM NO MIND.

415
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,520
FORM UP THE WAGONS AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE.

416
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,790
FORM 'EM UP!

417
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,350
YOU HEAR THAT?! TIGHTEN UP!

418
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,290
COME UP HERE.

419
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,720
MY GOD,RACHEL. HOW MANY DO YOU THINK THERE ARE?

420
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,830
TOO MANY TO COUNT,I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

421
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,790
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

422
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,460
I CAN FEEL THEIR BREATHE.

423
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,820
OUR FIRST SIGHTING OF A BUFFALO HEARD

424
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,340
WAS A MEMORABLE MOMENT FOR ALL.

425
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,380
I'D SEEN IT BEFORE,BUT I WAS STILL IN AWE.

426
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,190
SHEER,DUMBSTRUCK AWE.

427
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,550
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?!

428
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,280
IT'S MEAT,MA'AM.

429
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,860
YOU GOT SOMETHING AGAINST MEAT?

430
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,630
WHAT DID WE BRING CATTLE FOR THEN?

431
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,860
KILLING THEM SAVES CATTLE FOR THE JOURNEY.

432
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,780
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,MA'AM,

433
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,190
THERE'LL BE SPOTS WHERE GAME IS SCARCE.

434
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,400
EVEN BUFFLER.

435
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,650
WHAT'S THAT?!

436
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,220
WOLVES.

437
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,510
MOUNTAIN MEN,WOLVES,AND BUZZARDS,

438
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,500
A REGULAR JAMBOREE OF LIKE-MINDED IDIOTS.

439
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,250
WHY DON'T YOU PRETTY LADIES

440
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,460
GO ON AND COLLECT CHIPS FOR US?

441
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,340
CHIPS?

442
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,760
BUFFALO CHIPS WERE PRAIRIE FUEL,

443
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,740
OIL OF THE PLAINS,FUEL FOR THE CAMPFIRE,

444
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,500
MANNA FROM THE BISON,FAST AND PLENTY.

445
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,490
BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO GATHER THEM.

446
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
HERE,PUT THEM IN HERE.

447
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,870
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

448
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,760
MARQUIS JONES,FROM ILLINOIS.

449
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,520
HOW MANY OF THESE DO THEY EXPECT US TO COLLECT?

450
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,630
THAT GREASY-LOOKING PIG SAID AS MANY AS WE COULD.

451
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,220
WE'LL SHOW HIM.

452
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,080
MAKE A CIRCLE.

453
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,080
CIRCLE 'EM UP,MY FRIENDS!

454
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:23,230
THE WOLVES TODAY,IT WAS BAD SIGN.

455
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,230
AND THESE PEOPLE YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO LEAD US,

456
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,770
THEY ARE BAD SIGN.

457
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,490
WE SHOULD GO BACK. TOMORROW.

458
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,120
THESE PEOPLE DON'T BELIEVE IN MAGIC OR SIGN.

459
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,600
DO YOU?

460
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,870
I CAN'T GET THESE PEOPLE

461
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,480
TO TURN BACK NOW. YOU KNOW THAT.

462
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,970
YOU'LL NOT TRY?

463
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,430
NO,I WON'T.

464
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,860
THE SENTINELS AWAKEN THE TRAIN AT 4:00.

465
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,170
BY 5 A.M.,THE ANIMALS WERE
ROUNDED UP FOR THE MORNING TREK.

466
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,290
BREAKFAST WAS FROM 6:00 TO 7:00,

467
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,560
AND AT 7:00 PRECISELY THE SIGNAL
WAS GIVEN TO ADVANCE.

468
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,580
FORWARD!

469
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,560
TEAMS WERE ROTATED DAILY
SO THAT THE WAGONS IN THE VANGUARD ONE DAY

470
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,010
WOULD BE IN THE EXTREME REAR THE NEXT,

471
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,820
AND WORK THEIR WAY UP THE COLUMN DAY BY DAY.

472
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:18,520
BEING IN THE TAIL OF THE COLUMN WAS ALWAYS WORST,

473
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,310
DUE TO THE DUST KICKED UP BY THE WAGONS.

474
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,410
CAPTAIN HOXIE WANTED THINGS ORGANIZED

475
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,150
"FOR THE WELFARE OF ALL THE OVERLANDERS,"
HE'D SAY.

476
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,230
WHEREVER YOU WERE BOUND,

477
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,450
THERE WAS ONE GOLDEN RULE FOR THE PIONEERS:

478
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,180
FOLLOW THE RIVER.

479
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,310
BRING 'EM RIGHT HERE!

480
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,010
PICK IT UP! PICK IT UP!

481
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,890
PUSH IT! KEEP IT MOVING! THAT'S IT!

482
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,250
KEEP IT ON THE ANGLE THERE!

483
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,130
KEEP IT ON THE ANGLE!

484
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,910
LET THE HOLD-ROPE PULL YOU,JETHRO ON THE ANGLE!

485
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,470
ON THE ANGLE! I KNOW!

486
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,410
YOU TOLD ME A THOUSAND TIMES!

487
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,960
EASY NOW!

488
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,200
STAY ON THE OBLIQUE,PREACHER.

489
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,780
WATCH THE CURRENT!

490
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,830
OH,NO! SOMEBODY!

491
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,130
HELP THEM!

492
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,020
HELP! GET THEM!

493
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,070
NO!

494
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:26,580
HELP! HELP!

495
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,920
LEAH!

496
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,150
SHE FELL,JETHRO!

497
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,340
STAY WITH THE WAGON!

498
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,770
SHE CAN'T SWIM!

499
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,420
NEITHER CAN YOU!

500
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,330
YOU SEE HER?

501
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,400
LEAH!

502
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,270
WHERE IS SHE?!

503
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,600
DO YOU SEE HER?

504
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,680
NO!

505
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,700
YOU WERE TO CROSS AT THE ANGLE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE

506
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,100
TO WAIT FOR THE HOLD-ROPES!

507
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,210
BUT,NO,YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN!

508
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,430
THOSE ARE GROUNDS TO CUT YOU OFF PREACHER
AND LEAVE YOU HERE.

509
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,680
DAMN IT,CAPTAIN HOXIE! THAT'S ENOUGH NOW.

510
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,240
LEAVE IT.

511
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,860
NO. NO.

512
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,170
GOD,IN HIS GREATNESS,

513
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,190
IN HIS MYSTERIOUS WORKINGS,

514
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,530
HAS TAKEN THIS CHILD FROM US.

515
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,990
WE WEEP FOR HER AND HER FAMILY,

516
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,760
AND WE KNOW THAT GOD WEEPS WITH US.

517
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,220
THOUGH WE KNOW NOT WHY,

518
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,180
WE THANK THEE,GOD,FOR THY BLESSINGS,

519
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,680
AND PRAY THAT YOU WILL PROTECT THIS CHILD.

520
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,520
SHOW US THY WILL.

521
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,330
LET THEY MERCY REST ON US.

522
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,690
AMEN.

523
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,940
AMEN.

524
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,670
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS WAGON TRAIN BUSINESS.

525
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,600
I WANNA GO BACK,JACOB.

526
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,380
ME,TOO.

527
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,050
BACK TO MISSOURI,YOU HEAR?

528
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,840
WE'RE ALL SICK OF IT!

529
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,860
THE WOMEN,ANYWAY. TAKE US BACK!

530
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,370
MISS RACHEL?

531
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,640
I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW...

532
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,360
HOW SORRY I AM ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

533
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,440
THANK YOU,MR. EBBETTS.

534
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,430
YOU CAN CALL ME JAMES. OR JIM,EVEN.

535
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,130
JIM.

536
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,650
I HOPE IT'S NOT THE CASE

537
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,190
THAT YOU'RE PLANNING ON GOING BACK,MISS RACHEL.

538
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,460
'CAUSE I SURE DO ENJOY THE SIGHT
OF YOU HERE IN THIS TRAIN.

539
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,990
YOUR PRESENCE.

540
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,790
IT PLEASES ME.

541
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,810
MY PRESENCE?

542
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,690
THE SIGHT OF ME?

543
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,350
I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO FEEL LIKE A WOMAN AGAIN.

544
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,080
CLEAN HAIR,SMOOTH SKIN,

545
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,940
WEARING MY SUNDAY BEST.

546
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,720
MAYBE GO ON A PICNIC.

547
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,000
THAT'S AS MUCH PRAIRIE
AS I EVER WANNA SEE AGAIN.

548
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,590
AND THEN RIGHT BACK HOME.

549
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,680
A PLACE THAT DOESN'T WEAVE
AND ROLL TO THE SWAY OF THE LAND.

550
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,970
SOMETHING FIXED AND PERMANENT.

551
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,620
A PLACE TO REST.

552
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,230
LEAH'S RESTING NOW.

553
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,730
SHE'S THE LUCKY ONE.

554
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,400
STORM'S A-COMING!

555
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,630
BETTER TAKE SHELTER IN THAT COVER UP AHEAD.

556
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,020
TREES ARE GETTIN' SCARCE,CAPTAIN.

557
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,690
WE GOTTA GRAB THE ONES WE GOT.

558
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,240
CAN WE NOT OBTAIN A FEW MORE MILES,AT LEAST?

559
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,070
LAST THING YOU WANT IN THE WIDE OPEN IS A STORM.

560
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,900
HE'S RIGHT,CAPTAIN HOXIE!

561
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,160

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,670
HANG ON TO IT! DON'T LET IT GO!

568
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,830

572
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,270

00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,800
IT'S SAFER UNDER THERE!

00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,010
GET UNDERNEATH! EVERYBODY,UNDERNEATH!

575
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,030

576
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,120
NAOMI!

577
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,070
KILL ME!

578
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,250
PLEASE,GOD,HIT ME WITH A THUNDERBOLT!

579
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,550
GET BACK HERE!

580
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,280
LEAVE ME BE!

581
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,790
I WANNA DIE!

582
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,780
NAOMI!

583
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,210
GOOD,SKATE! THANKS!

584
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,360
NO!

585
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,140
CATTLE STOMPED MY BOY.

586
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,110
RAN RIGHT OVER HIM.

587
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,560
COME ON,BOYS!

588
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,840
PUSH!

589
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,340
IT'S UP!

590
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:07,860
PUSH!

591
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,130
ALL OUR CORN AND MEAL,RUINED.

592
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,780
MIGHT AS WELL DUMP IT.

593
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,180
EVERYBODY!

594
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,370
WE ARE READY NOW.

595
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,320
YOU DIDN'T WANNA DIE LAST NIGHT
DID YOU,MISS NAOMI?

596
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,600
I DON'T KNOW,SKATE.

597
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,070
YOU WERE THE ONE CAME RIDING AFTER ME.

598
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,090
I GUESS YOU THOUGHT SO.

599
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,180
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.

600
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,880
A WOMAN LIKE YOU HAS GOT
TOO MUCH LIFE AHEAD OF HER.

601
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,060
GOOD LIFE.

602
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,950
GET IN THE WAGON.

603
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,660
I WON'T LEAVE MY BABY BEHIND.

604
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,910
I WANT TO STAY WITH HIM!

605
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,020
PLEASE LET ME STAY WITH HIM!

606
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,820
WHY'D YOU BRING US HERE?

607
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,040
WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS THIS?

608
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,420
BETTERIN' OURSELVES,IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

609
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,860
WHY CAN'T A NIGGER JUST KNOW HIS PLACE?

610
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,860
WHY CAN'T A MAN JUST KNOW---

611
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,310
WE WILL COME BACK AND VISIT HIM.

612
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,380
AND PLACE FLOWERS.

613
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,900
WHEN? HOW?

614
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,990
I COULD NEVER FIND THIS PLACE!

615
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,710
I COULD FIND IT FOR YOU,MA'AM.

616
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,830
ANYTIME YOU WANT,I'LL BRING YOU BACK HERE.

617
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,270
YOU CAN VISIT YOUR BOY.

618
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,560
WOULD YOU REALLY?

619
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,760
ANY TIME.

620
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,220
WOULD YOU DANCE WITH ME,MISS RACHEL?

621
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,630
NO.

622
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,310
LET'S JUST WALK FOR A BIT.

623
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,290
NICE MOON TONIGHT,ISN'T IT?

624
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,990
NICE ENOUGH.

625
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,970
I'D HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THE WEST,

626
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,760
I COULDN'T WAIT TO GIVE IT A GANDER.

627
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,680
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER GETTING MARRIED SOME DAY?

628
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,950
YES,SOME DAY,I IMAGINE.

629
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,830
WOULDN'T YOU?

630
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,640
THAT'S WHY I ASKED.

631
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,930
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

632
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:22,090
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

633
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,870
NOW?

634
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,340
WELL,NOT RIGHT THIS MINUTE.

635
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:32,680
MAYBE IN A COUPLE DAYS WHEN TIME PERMITS.

636
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,390
I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ME.

637
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,500
WE'LL HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT.

638
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,410
WHEN WE GET TO CALIFORNIA,

639
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,320
I INTEND TO FARM.

640
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,720
I'LL BUILD YOU A PROPER HOUSE.

641
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,890
I HEARD THE GRASS IS SO GOOD,

642
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,820
YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT UP HAY.

643
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,590
ALL RIGHT,THEN.

644
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,470
I'LL MARRY YOU.

645
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,370
THAT WENT EASIER THAN I THOUGHT.

646
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,130
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

647
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,460
AND NOW,WITH THE POWER

648
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,270
GRANTED BY THE GREAT CREATOR HIMSELF,

649
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,350
I HEREBY PRONOUNCE YOU

650
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,810
MAN AND WIFE.

651
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,890
YES! EXCELLENT! WELL DONE!

652
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,250
WHO'S NEXT?

653
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,290
YOU HAVE A RING?

654
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,350
YES,SIR. I DO.

655
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:49,250
VERY WELL.

656
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,480
I NEED YOUR CHRISTIAN NAME,SKATE.

657
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,510
ALFRED BERTRAM GUTHRIE,JUNIOR.

658
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,960
FOLKS GOT MARRIED,PEOPLE DIED,

659
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,620
BABIES WERE BORN.

660
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,900
IT WAS THE WHEEL OF LIFE.

661
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:05,970
SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLAINS

662
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,390
MADE PEOPLE CLING TO ONE ANOTHER,

663
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,560
AND LEAVE THE GRIEF BEHIND.

664
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,320
HELL,GRIEF WAS A LUXURY NONE OF US COULD AFFORD.

665
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,180
WE HAD TO MOVE ON,

666
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,720
TOIL AND DRIVE,PLOD AND PUSH.

667
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,390
JUST KEEP MOVING.

668
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,350
AND WHEN A WEDDING HAPPENED,

669
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,960
WE'D ALL CELEBRATE.

670
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,730
"SHIVAREE," WE CALLED IT.

671
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,380
DOG STAR!

672
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,670
DOG STAR!

673
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,900
THERE'S TROUBLE IN THE OTHER CAMP!

674
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:48,180
COME!

675
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,150
QUICK!

676
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,170
CROW!

677
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,310
CROW DID THIS?

678
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,220
WITH RIFLES THEY KILLED OUR WARRIORS.

679
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:40,680
ARROWS AND KNIVES FOR THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN

680
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,500
NOW THAT THE CROW HAVE RIFILES

681
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:49,440
THEY INVADE OUR HUNTING GROUND AND KILL LAKOTA?

682
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,290
WHY?

683
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:59,420
WHY?!DO I HAVE TO MAKE WAR UPON
THEM TO GAIN THE ANSWER?

684
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,920
ALL RIGHT,STEADY.

685
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,130
LET'S GO!

686
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,290
LOOK OUT BELOW!

687
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:46,350
EASE UP ON YOUR SIDE,MR. HARPER!

688
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,800
STEADY!

689
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,580
RACHEL,LOOK OUT!

690
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,730
RACHEL,JUST LIE STILL. NOW JUST LIE STILL.

691
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,720
SHH. HUSH NOW.

692
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,600
STOP!

693
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,600
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT SHE'S IN AGONY?

694
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,790
IT'S A COMPOUND FRACTURE.

695
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,570
I CAN DRESS IT AS BEST AS I CAN,

696
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,560
BUT IT'S BAD.

697
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,110
TWO,PREACHER.

698
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,150
SHE CAN'T SLEEP,JACOB.

699
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,170
SHE SAYS THERE'S SOMETHING CRAWLING IN THERE.

700
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,810
CRAWLING WHERE?

701
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,220
RACHEL,JACOB AND THE PREACHER ARE HERE.

702
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,730
JIM?

703
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,470
JUST LIE BACK.

704
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:38,860
TRY AND GET SOME REST.

705
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:49,000
GANGRENE HAS SET IN.

706
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,350
WHAT ABOUT SURGERY?

707
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,350
YOU MEAN AMPUTATE?

708
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,870
WELL,YOU'RE A DOCTOR THAT'S
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN CLAIMING.

709
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,280
CAN SHE BE SAVED?

710
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,050
I DON'T BELIEVE SO. IT'S SPREAD TOO FAR.

711
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,490
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY.

712
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,950
THERE'S NO POINT TO NEEDLESS AGONY.

713
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,770
SHE'S SUFFERED LONG ENOUGH.

714
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,980
SO WE JUST LET HER DIE?

715
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,720
SHE'S MY WIFE! SHE'S MY COUSIN!

716
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,240
SHOULDN'T WE LEAVE THIS TO HER?

717
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:12,180
IT'S HER LEG,HER BODY.

718
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,780
HERE. LAUDANUM.

719
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,570
IT'S NOT MUCH,BUT IT'S ALL I'VE GOT.

720
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,110
YOU'D BETTER TAKE IT.

721
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,350
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT,RACHEL.

722
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,910
WE'RE GONNA FIX YOU UP.

723
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,930
BITE DOWN HARD.

724
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,220
THAT'S IT.

725
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,070
ALL RIGHT THEN.

726
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,790
IT TOOK AN HOUR AND A HALF

727
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,280
FOR HIM TO HACK THROUGH THE BONE,

728
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,330
BUT BY THAT POINT RACHEL HAD DIED.

729
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,050
SEEKING ANSWERS,AS WISE MEN DO,

730
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,300
DOG STAR TRAVELED TO PAHA SAPA,

731
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,110
THE HEART OF ALL THINGS,

732
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,730
A PLACE WHERE MEN PRAYED FOR VISIONS.

733
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,500
THERE HE FOUND HIS BROTHER,

734
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,340
LOVED BY THE BUFFALO,

735
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,780
WHO WAS OVERJOYED TO SEE HIM.

736
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,690
RUNNING FOX,OUR BROTHER,LEFT THE TRIBE

737
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,950
BECAUSE HE BELIEVED
IF WE DO NOT LEARN THE WHITE MAN'S WAYS

738
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:56,810
WE WILL BE UNABLE TO RESIST THEM.

739
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,860
I INSISTED TAHT WE REMAIN TRUE
TO THE GRANDFATHER SPIRIT.

740
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,470
TO THE ANCIENT WAYS OF THE LAKOTA

741
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:06,680
WAS I WRONG?

742
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,020
DOES WAKEN TANKA SPEAK WITH YOU?

743
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:16,070
I SEEK HIM EVERY DAY.

744
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,560
THEN TELL ME ...DO YOU NEED TO ALTER OUR WAYS?

745
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,070
NO...NEVER...

746
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,070
YOU ARE SURE OF THIS?

747
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,600
IN MY HEART I KNOW THIS WELL.

748
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,290
I HAVE DEVOTED MYSELF TO PRESERVING OUR WAYS.

749
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,850
IT IS MY MISSION TO DO THIS.

750
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,730
I SHALL LIVE LONG ENOUGH
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MISSION

751
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,710
AND NO LONGER

752
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,710
HOXIE!

753
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,400
HOLD THE WAGONS! SKATE,STAY WITH THEM!

754
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,050
THAT'S THE CHOLERA IF EVER I SEEN IT.

755
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,150
PREACHER?

756
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,700
SHE HAD BOWEL TROUBLE?

757
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,220
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?

758
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,870
I WAS HOPING IT WOULD PASS.

759
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,080
YOU TELL HIM,PREACHER.

760
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,320
THAT'S THE DREAD CHOLERA.

761
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,760
AS FAR AS THIS HOSS IS CONCERNED,

762
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,070
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

763
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,530
YOU'D BETTER CALL A COUNCIL,CAP'N.

764
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,220
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS

765
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:54,530
ARE WITH MR. JONES AND HIS DAUGHTER.

766
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,670
CHOLERA WAS THE MOST FEARED DISEASE ON THE TRAIL,

767
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:59,330
FOLKS NOT KNOWING WHAT BROUGHT IT ON,

768
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:04,030
BAD AIR,BAD WATER,FEVER IT KILLED INDISCRIMINATELY

769
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,670
AND THE ONLY RESPONSE AT THE TIME WAS QUARANTINE.

770
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,720
OUR REAR GUARD WILL REMAIN BEHIND.

771
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,630
WE WILL AWAIT YOUR RETURN

772
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,740
WITH OPEN ARMS.

773
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,290
THE WAGONS THAT HAD NO CONTACT

774
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:24,210
WITH THE DEAD WOMAN WOULD LEAVE

775
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,260
WHILE THE REMAINDER WOULD STAY BEHIND FOR A SPELL,

776
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,040
BEFORE GOING THEIR OWN WAY.

777
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,390
WE WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH.

778
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,960
AND GODSPEED.

779
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,680
TO THE WAGONS!

780
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,150
NAOMI,WHO'D BEEN UP FRONT WITH HER NEW HUSBAND,

781
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,720
BID US FAREWELL

782
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,750
AND NO ONE BLAMED HER.

783
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,410
WE WERE LEFT TO FEND FOR OURSELVES

784
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:07,830
AND WAIT TO SEE WHO AMONG US

785
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,940
MIGHT BE THE NEXT TO BECOME INFECTED.

786
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:38,890
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

787
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,390
I'M GONNA SEPARATE HIM FROM US,SEE TO HIM.

788
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:42,760
IT'S ALL I KNOW HOW TO DO.

789
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:44,230
YOUR FAMILY'S HERE.

790
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,340
YOU ARE THE REASON WE ARE HERE,WHY WE CAME.

791
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,440
SHE'S RIGHT. LET ME BE.

792
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,660
IF I GET SICK YOU'D BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME.

793
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,740
BUT YOU ARE NOT SICK.

794
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:56,300
HE IS!

795
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,150
I'LL KNOW IF I AM SOON ENOUGH.

796
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,870
WITH CHOLERA IF IT DON'T GET YOU IN THE FIRST DAY,

797
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,850
CHANCES ARE YOU RECOVER.

798
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,270
WHAT IF YOU DO NOT? WHAT DO WE DO?

799
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,370
BOIL YOUR WATER BEFORE YOU DRINK IT.

800
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,100
GO ON WITHOUT ME,CATCH UP WITH THE OTHERS.

801
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,590
THEY WILL NOT TAKE US BACK.

802
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,700
THEN GO ON YOUR OWN. FIND YOUR OWN PEOPLE.

803
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,440
IS THAT WHY YOU BROUGHT ME OUT HERE?

804
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,740
TO FIND MY OWN PEOPLE?

805
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:16,960
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN?

806
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,550
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME,WOMAN?!

807
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,520
I WANT MY HUSBAND.

808
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:35,560
LET ME BE,JACOB. GO TO THE OTHERS.

809
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,180
NOPE.

810
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,560
I LOST RACHEL,I LOST LEAH,

811
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:44,310
I AIN'T LOSING NO MORE.

812
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,280
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET 'EM COME.

813
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,520
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT THEM IN VIRGINIA.

814
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:50,840
THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY GIVE YOU A CHOICE.

815
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,780
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ENVIOUS OF YOU,BROTHER.

816
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,920
YOU ALWAYS HAD THAT SPARK,

817
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,630
THAT SENSE OF ADVENTURE.

818
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:12,040
I ALWAYS WISHED I COULD BE LIKE THAT,

819
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,760
LIKE YOU.

820
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,850
YOU ARE LIKE ME,JETHRO.

821
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,250
THAT'S THE NICEST THING YOU COULD SAY TO ME.

822
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,030
WE'RE GONNA BE LIVING IN THE WEST TOGETHER,

823
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,850
AND HAVE FARMS BESIDE ONE ANOTHER.

824
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,040
YOU GONNA BE RAISING A FAMILY

825
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,350
NEXT TO MINE.

826
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,720
JACOB?

827
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:46,040
JACOB?

828
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,000
WAKE UP. JACOB?

829
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,670
HOW IS HE?

830
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,690
BETTER. HONEST.

831
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:59,250
CAN YOU STAND UP?

832
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,650
YOU ALL RIGHT?

833
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,310
WHAT ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE?

834
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,340
GOOD.

835
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:12,140
WE HAVE BEEN BOILING OUR WATER.

836
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:13,710
WE'LL CATCH UP WITH THE OTHERS THEN.

837
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,460
THE WAY I FIGURE IT,THEY'RE ABOUT A DAY AHEAD.

838
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:19,100
I'LL GO AHEAD ALONE,GET 'EM TO SLOW UP,

839
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,180
THEN COME BACK FOR YOU.

840
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,290
YOU FOUGHT 'EM HARD,DIDN'T YOU,SKATE?

841
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:19,960
BET YOU KILLED MORE THAN YOUR SHARE OF 'EM.

842
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:29,980
IS IT 'CAUSE THEY TOOK NAOMI?

843
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,420
COME ON,JACOB! COME ON!

844
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,630
DID YOU FIND THEM?

845
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,340
THEY'RE WIPED OUT.

846
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,560
NOW THEY WANT US.

847
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,580
THEY'RE CHEYENNE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

848
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:16,400
THE DISEASE. CHOLERA.

849
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,780
BY KILLING US,IT WILL NOT SPREAD TO THEM.

850
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,700
ARE THEY GONNA COME OR WHAT?

851
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,630
MAYBE THEY JUST WANT TO FRIGHTEN US A BIT.

852
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,700
WITH EACH CIRCLE,THEY COME CLOSER.

853
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:48,700
MOVE! GET DOWN!

854
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:12,220
JACOB!

855
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,470
PULL IT OUT,JETHRO. UHH!

856
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,740
PULL IT--AAH!

857
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:49,710
ARE YOU SICK WITH FEVER?

858
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:51,180
NO.

859
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:53,340
HOW ARE YOU CALLED?

860
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:56,400
NAOMI WHEELER--

861
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,860
GUTHRIE. MRS. SKATE GUTHRIE.

862
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,850
HE WAS MY HUSBAND.

863
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,030
YOUR WARRIORS KILLED HIM.

864
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:08,680
HE,TOO,HAS LOST A LOVED ONE.

865
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,120

866
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:22,260
YOU WILL NOW BE CALLED FIVE HORSES.

867
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:25,230
THANK YOU KINDLY.

868
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,110
WHAT IS THAT?

869
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,820
SPECIAL OILS.

870
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,640
MAKE PRAIRIE FIRE BURN ALL NIGHT.

871
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,400
AM I TO BE MARRIED TONIGHT,IS THAT IT?

872
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:23,510
HEY,DIDDLE DIDDLE,THE CAT AND THE FIDDLE,

873
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,300
THE COW JUMPED OVER THE MOON.

874
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,190
LITTLE MISS MUFFET SAT ON A TUFFET

875
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,510
EATING HER CURDS AND WHEY,

876
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:30,550
ALONG CAME A SPIDER,SAT DOWN BESIDE HER,

877
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:32,790
AND FRIGHTENED MISS MUFFET AWAY.

878
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,760
LITTLE MISS MUFFET SAT
ON HER TUFFET EATING HER CURDS AND WHEY,

879
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:38,400
ALONG CAME A SPIDER,SAT DOWN BESIDE HER,

880
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,650
AND FRIGHTENED MISS MUFFET AWAY.

881
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,590
...EATING HIS PUMPKIN PIE,

882
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,070
PUT IN HIS THUMB,PULLED OUT A PLUMB,

883
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,630
AND SAID,"GEE,WHAT A GOOD BOY AM I."

884
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,760
OLE KING COLE WAS A MERRY OLD SOUL,

885
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,490
A MERRY OLD SOUL WAS HE,

886
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,110
HE CALLED FOR HIS PIPE,HE CALLED FOR HIS BOWL,

887
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:05,080
HE CALLED FOR HIS FIDDLER'S THREE.

888
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,610
HE BELIEVES YOU CHANNEL EVIL SPIRITS

889
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:13,170
WITH THESE RHYMES.

890
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:16,880
MORE LIKE KEEPING EVIL SPIRITS AWAY.

891
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,170
OLD MOTHER HUBBARD WENT TO HER CUPBOARD

892
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:22,140
TO FETCH HER POOR DOG A BONE,

893
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:23,870
BUT WHEN SHE GOT THERE,THE CUPBOARD WAS BARE,

894
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,420
SO HER POOR DOG HAD NONE.

895
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,850
AAH! I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

896
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,410
STOP THE WAGON!

897
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,680
LEAVE ME HERE.

898
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:46,460
LEAVE ME HERE.

899
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,020
WE WILL NOT.

900
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:49,830
I--UHH!

901
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:51,720
THE WAGON. I CAN'T TAKE THE PAIN.

902
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,040
I GOT TO GET OUT.

903
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,620
WE WILL CAMP HERE UNTIL YOU ARE WELL.

904
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,490
NO. NO.

905
01:10:58,330 --> 01:10:59,150
WINTER'S COMING.

906
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:00,860
YOU GOT TO GET PAST THE MOUNTAINS.

907
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,950
TAKE THE CHILDREN.GO WITH JETHRO

908
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:03,750
I'LL FIND YOU.

909
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:04,520
LORD ALMIGHTY.

910
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,960
HOW COULD YOU ASK ME TO DO A THING LIKE THAT?

911
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,910
HUH? JUST ABANDON YOU HERE?

912
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,450
THE TRAIL'S GONNA KILL ME QUICKER
THAN IF YOU LEAVE ME BEHIND.

913
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:11,780
AT LEAST HERE I CAN REST.

914
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,400
I CAN HEAL UP ON MY OWN TERMS.

915
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,600
PLEASE JUST LEAVE ME HERE.

916
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,590
THANK YOU

917
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,550
FOR FINDING ME.

918
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:33,550
FOR SAVING ME,AND FOR LOVING ME.

919
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:37,050
LOVING YOU IS EASY,IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN,

920
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,610
BUT I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN.

921
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,210
I KNOW IT.

922
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,110
JACOB...

923
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,290
YOUNG MARGARET LIGHT SHINES,

924
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,560
YOU MIND YOUR MOTHER.

925
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:50,750
OK.

926
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,530
AND NEVER FORGET WHO YOU ARE.

927
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:59,250
YOU'RE ONE PART LAKOTA,ONE PART VIRGINIA.

928
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:03,200
ABRAHAM HIGH WOLF,

929
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,630
REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE ALWAYS,

930
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,390
AND REMIND YOUR BROTHER JACOB.

931
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,290
I LOVE YOU

932
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,660
I DOUBTED I WOULD MAKE IT.

933
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:49,330
I THOUGHT OF GRANDFATHER TWO ARROWS
AND GRANDMOTHER GOOD PATH,

934
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:53,850
HOW THEY HAD ACCEPTED DEATH
AS THEY'D ACCEPTED LIFE.

935
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,690
NOW IT WAS MY TURN.

936
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,850
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

937
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,550
HOT. FEVER. YES.

938
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,740
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR CHILD

939
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:06,440
HE LIVES...BUT NOT LONG...

940
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,790
CHEYENNE?

941
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,000
A GIFT FROM WAKAN TANKA.

942
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,170
NO OTHER WAY TO EXPLAIN MY WIFE'S BROTHER

943
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:24,580
COMING UPON ME LIKE HE DID.

944
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:25,780
FOR 3 DAYS,

945
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,230
HE AND HIS BAND CARED FOR ME

946
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,770
AND I SHARED THE STORY OF MY FAMILY'S DEPARTURE

947
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,030
AND MY MISSION TO FIND THEM.

948
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,930
IT HURT TO TRADE A RIFLE FOR A HORSE,

949
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,920
BUT I KNEW I COULD NEVER CATCH UP TO MY FAMILY

950
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:44,700
ON FOOT.

951
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,300
WINTER WAS IN THE AIR,

952
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:48,470
AND IF I COULD NOT CROSS THE SIERRAS,

953
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,480
THEY WOULD BE LOST TO ME UNTIL SPRING.

954
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:55,200
BEST LAID PLANS,PEOPLE CALL 'EM.

955
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,770
WELL,WINTER DID COME EARLY.

956
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,190
20-FOOT SNOW DRIFTS CLOSED THE PASS.

957
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,390
IT'S TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE REAL.

958
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:28,240
WHAT IS IT,MAMA?

959
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,090
BEYOND THAT,

960
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,140
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE,

961
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,940
IS CALIFORNIA,

962
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,750
JUST AS YOUR FATHER SAID.

963
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,540
WILL DADDY EVER SEE IT?

964
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:11,080
HOW CAN YOU TURN DOWN NINE HORSES,PRAIRIE FIRE,

965
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,440
WHEN YOU ONLY PAID FIVE FOR HER?

966
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,520
TELL ME SOMETHING.HOWLING COYOTE.

967
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:19,310
CAN ANY OF YOUR HORSES SING LIKE FIVE HORSES?

968
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,190
THIS MOST SACRED POSSESSION
HAS BEEN IN MY FAMILY...

969
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,760
...FOR GENERATIONS.

970
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,130
CAN IT SING?

971
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:09,820
LET'S GO!

972
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,660
NATURE'S UNFORGIVING TEMPEST AND MY OWN RUINS

973
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,160
CONSPIRED TO DEFEAT MY PURPOSE,

974
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,310
AND SO I BECAME A CREATURE OF THE WILDERNESS,

975
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,790
NOT A SOUL TO ANSWER TO.

976
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,470
I TRAPPED. I HUNTED.

977
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,500
I SURVIVED.

978
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:20,980
WHAT SHALL WE CALL YOUR SON,HUSBAND?

979
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:24,840
MY SON...OUR SON...SHALL BE...

980
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,900
ONE HORN BULL!

981
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:39,150
THE MOUNTAINS CLAIMED MY COMPANY FOR 2 SEASONS,

982
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:43,640
AND EVENTUALLY THEY CLAIMED MY MIND.

983
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,060
THE EYES OF MY CHILDREN HAUNTED ME,

984
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,910
HAUNTED ME BECAUSE I KNEW THEIR LITTLE EYES

985
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:59,340
STILL HELD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD SEE ME AGAIN.

986
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,000
SOMETIMES I LOST CONTROL
WHEN I REMEMBERED THEIR FACES

987
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,750
AND THE LIFE I WANTED TO LIVE WITH THEM.

988
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:10,450
THOSE LITTLE EYES WOULD ALWAYS
BE LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD FOR ME.

989
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:46,610
YOU ARE HAPPY HERE?

990
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,740
WITH OUR FAMILY? OUR TRIBE?

991
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,060
I AM GLAD TO BE HERE.

992
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,390
YOU ARE HAPPY?

993
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:03,660
YES

994
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:22,720
AFTER THAT AWFUL SECOND WINTER,

995
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,730
I TRADED PELTS FOR GOODS AND ANIMALS

996
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,910
AND HEADED TO CALIFORNIA TO FIND MY FAMILY.

997
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:29,420
I INQUIRED AFTER THEM

998
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,340
IN EVERY MISSION AND EVERY FARM HOUSE,

999
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:34,160
EVERY TOWN,EVERY STRANGER ALONG THE ROAD.

1000
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:36,460
I LIVED FOR THE MOMENT
WHEN I COULD REDEEM THE HOPE

1001
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,950
IN THE EYES OF MY CHILDREN,

1002
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:42,740
BUT IT SEEMED CALIFORNIA
HAD JUST SWALLOWED THEM UP.

1003
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,790
WAR BROKE OUT BETWEEN MY COUNTRY AND MEXICO.

1004
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,000
WHILE LOOKING FOR MY FAMILY,

1005
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,290
I GOT CAUGHT UP IN A STRUGGLE

1006
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:55,350
BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIOS AND MEXICO CITY.

1007
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,760
I FELL IN WITH CAPTAIN JOHN FREMONT

1008
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,680
AND HIS BEAR FLAG VOLUNTEERS.

1009
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,840
WE SAW NO ACTION TO BRAG ABOUT

1010
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,870
AS THE HOT WAR WAS ON THE TEXAS BORDER.

1011
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:09,040
WHEN IT WAS OVER,AMERICA HAD ACQUIRED TEXAS,

1012
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,960
CALIFORNIA,AND THE SOUTHWEST,

1013
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,790
BUT I LOST EVERYTHING.

1014
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:25,210
MA'AM,I'M CAPTAIN FREMONT
AND THESE ARE MY VOLUNTEERS.

1015
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,230
WE'D BE MUCH OBLIGED

1016
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:29,430
IF YOU'D ALLOW US TO FILL OUR CANTEENS.

1017
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,550
DISMOUNT!

1018
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:03,160
WELCOME. I'M THE LADY'S HUSBAND.

1019
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:05,440
YOU THE HERO OF MONTERREY?

1020
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,020
SOME CALL ME THAT.

1021
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,560
JACOB!

1022
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,490
GIVE THESE TO THE MEN.

1023
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,740
FRUIT,MISTER?

1024
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,810
PICK ME A GOOD ONE.

1025
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:49,290
SAY,BOY?

1026
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,010
YES,SIR?

1027
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:54,020
THAT'S THE BEST DAMN APPLE I EVER HAD.

1028
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,700
YOU PICKED ME A REAL WINNER,

1029
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,620
SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A GIFT

1030
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:59,520
TO SHOW YOU MY APPRECIATION.

1031
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,170
GIFT?

1032
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:01,870
YEAH,PUT THAT DOWN.

1033
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,130
IT'S A MAGIC NECKLACE,

1034
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:06,720
AND THE MAGIC'S STRONGER

1035
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:10,070
IF YOU TELL NO ONE ABOUT IT.

1036
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,360
TELL NO ONE?

1037
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,200
THAT'S RIGHT.

1038
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:16,840
THANKS.

1039
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,380
THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS,SIR.

1040
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:21,860
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1041
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,760
I SAW A FAMILY,

1042
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,640
A HAPPY FAMILY.

1043
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
I SAW THE HOME I DREAMED OF FOR ALL OF US,

1044
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:37,660
A PEACEFUL PLACE WITH SUN AND RAIN FOR CROPS.

1045
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:40,090
I SAW A COUPLE WHO CARED FOR EACH OTHER

1046
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,360
AND LOOKED AFTER THEIR CHILDREN.

1047
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:45,730
WHAT MORE COULD A MAN WANT FOR HIS FAMILY?

1048
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,730
SO I TOOK MY HEARTBREAK TO THE MOUNTAINS.

1049
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,170
ONLY THEY COULD UNDERSTAND THE IMMENSITY.

1050
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,810
JACOB?

1051
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:05,560
YES,MAMA?

1052
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:09,810
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

1053
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,330
ONE OF THE MEN GAVE IT TO ME.

1054
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,070
WHICH ONE?

1055
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:16,930
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE? DESCRIBE HIM TO ME.

1056
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:22,470
HE WAS TALL LIKE UNCLE JETHRO.

1057
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:26,780
WHAT DID HE SAY?

1058
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:30,110
HE LIKED MY APPLE.

1059
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,040
WHAT'S WRONG,MAMA?

1060
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,470
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?

1061
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:42,660
YES,IT IS PRECIOUS.

1062
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:44,990
KEEP IT.

1063
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:56,600
WHITE HIDE HUNTERS CAME WITH THEIR LONG GUNS

1064
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,220
AND KILLED THE BUFFALO,

1065
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:02,220
LEAVING CARCASSES TO ROT
ACROSS THE ENDLESS PRAIRIES.

1066
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,760
WITHOUT IT'S FLESH AND SPIRIT TO SUSTAIN THEM,

1067
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:10,800
THE PEOPLE OF THE BUFFALO NATION
BEGAN TO LOSE THEIR WAY.

1068
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,260
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR THESE?

1069
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:18,490
DO YOU HAVE ANY HAND RIFLES?

1070
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,940
YOU WANT PISTOLS? COLT PISTOLS?

1071
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,630
PISTOLS.

1072
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:27,530
FOR ALL.

1073
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:31,110
BY LAW,I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SELL THEM TO INDIANS.

1074
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,420
CAN'T HELP YOU THERE,

1075
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:33,980
BUT...

1076
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,490
WHISKEY.

1077
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,810
WHISKEY.

1078
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,540
A PINT EACH. HOW ABOUT THAT?

1079
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,010

1080
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,730
THIS IS GOOD TO DRI...

1081
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,010
DID YOU SEE HIM?

1082
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,660
NO.

1083
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:46,800
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS HIM?

1084
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:48,940
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYBODY.

1085
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,200
WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?

1086
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:54,540
WHO ELSE BUT JACOB WOULD BOTHER?

1087
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:57,890
SO HE'S ALIVE AND HE KNOWS WE'RE HERE?

1088
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:01,590
AND WISHES TO LEAVE US ALONE.

1089
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:05,450

1090
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,640
DOES JETHRO KNOW?

1091
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:12,790
HE SAW IT ON THE BOY. IT EATS HIM INSIDE.

1092
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:16,110
I SHOULD HAVE BURIED IT,KEPT IT FROM HIM.

01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:21,780
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

1094
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:23,530
I HAVE TO FIND HIM.

1095
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,240
HE'S MY FATHER.

1096
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:17,390
IT HAS BEEN MANY YEARS,BROTHER.
