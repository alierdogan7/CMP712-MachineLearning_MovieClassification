1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
<i>- Previously on Wynonna Earp.
- What the sweet hell is this?</i>

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:03,890
I'm ready to help.

3
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:05,895
<i>(Wynonna): You're supposed
to be normal, Waverly.</i>

4
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:07,568
<i>I scoured every archive in the country,</i>

5
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:09,013
<i>and you know what I never found?</i>

6
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,459
The reason why I can't break the curse.

7
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:13,577
- (Wynonna): What is that?
- Maldito, New Mexico.

8
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:15,830
This is what victories
might have to look like.

9
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,883
<i>(Waverly): There's something about him.</i>

10
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:19,107
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

11
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:22,303
<i>A trailer park proprietered
by one Bobo Del Rey.</i>

12
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:23,685
You do not know what I am.

13
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,280
I know what you're supposed to be.

14
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,591
<i>My name is John Henry, but most people</i>

15
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,343
just call me Doc.

16
00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,150
I'm gonna tell you a
tale about the last time

17
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,185
I saw my best
friend, the man who happens

18
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:40,354
to be your forebear.

19
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:41,822
I'm all ears, Hank. Hit me.

20
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:44,742
(coughing)

21
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,160
(door closing)

22
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:51,499
I'm all packed up, ready to go, Doc.

23
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,618
Headed for a burg called Purgatory.
See, a corrupted

24
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,704
lawman there out of fix

25
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,673
and in need of a little adjustment.

26
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:01,789
I've heard some things of
the particular corruption

27
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:04,595
of that damn sheriff.

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,681
Save your hoodoo-voodoo
talk for your Calico Queens.

29
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:09,717
They say he's part devil.

30
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,970
Ain't no such thing as devils.

31
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:15,222
Only men and the good and evil

32
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:17,975
they do in this
world. What say you, huh?

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,561
You got enough breath in
you for one more fight?

34
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,980
I think this is farewell, Wyatt.

35
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,232
Ah, fiddle-faddle. You'll be fine.

36
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,319
Farewell, old friend.

37
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,827
I'll see you on the other side, Doc.

38
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:48,255
It's a cute story.

39
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,424
But if you want me to
believe you're Doc Holliday,

40
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,927
you're gonna have to prove
it. Not only was Doc famous

41
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,062
for having the quickest
draw in the West but also...

42
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:57,681
- For the sharpness of my eye.
- (gunshots)

43
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:02,570
Now, has my little
demonstration convinced you?

44
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,104
(rock music playing)

45
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,941

Well then, what are you?

56
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,107
'Cause if you were a
revenant, you'd be blown off my land.

57
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:41,775
So what? A ghost?

58
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:44,028
Now, if I were a ghost

59
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,697
would my heart be pounding like it is?

60
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,870
You were reported dead 130 years ago.

61
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:55,072
I made a barter for eternal longevity.

62
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,992
Cured me of chronic tuberculosis

63
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,960
and freed me from the ravages of time,

64
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,746
unless I catch a bullet, a
knife, or an oncoming train.

65
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,465
With that mouth, I give you 10 minutes.

66
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,834
What did Wyatt think about that?

67
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,504
I brokered the deal long after

68
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,506
Wyatt and I bid our fare thee wells.

69
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,758
What about the curse?

70
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,311
Did Wyatt say anything about
why his descendants

71
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,647
have to battle the
outlaws he killed over

72
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,682
and over and over again?

73
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,818
Wyatt never mentioned it. I am sorry.

74
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:28,656
Why are you here? Why Purgatory?

75
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:31,025
Unfinished business.

76
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,193
Well, that makes two of us.

77
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,278
Ma'am.

78
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,749

79
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:42,920
I didn't mean to do it,
Sam. It was an accident!

80
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:45,005
Please! Please, forgive me!

81
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,624
Please! Say it!

82
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,044
You need help, Megan.

83
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,762
I do.

84
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,215
I do.

88
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:03,640
Forgiven? Or not?

89
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,784
I need more time.

90
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:15,369

- Good times.
- Mm-hmm. Neighbour found

101
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:03,394
the body, and Nedley's
outside keeping rubberneckers at bay.

102

He is slowly learning how this works.

103
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,589
And I haven't seen this
much blood since Kandahar.

104
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:11,125
- What were you doing in Iraq?
- Afghanistan,

105
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,128
and I'm gonna get you a map.
And I'm not at liberty to discuss.

106
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,963
You've brought it up.

107
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,384
God damn. Megan Halshford.

108
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,853
- Friend of yours?
- Hell, no. Couldn't stand her.

109
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,394
Megan Halshford?! Aww,
I always loved her.

110
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,613
You didn't know her like I did.

111
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,781
Waverly, do you know any revenants

112
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,949
that leave messages like that?

113
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:37,234
Do I!

114
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,286
Father Robert Malick.

115
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:42,239
A hellfire revivalist
minister known to rail against women,

116
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:45,159
demanding they repent. Wyatt hung Malick

117
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,044
for murdering his wife

118
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,962
and his girlfriend,
and some hookers too.

119
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,165
Any idea where this guy is so
I can shoot him in the dong?

120
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,417
Don't know. Hiding like the rest of 'em?

121
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:55,419
So we flush him out.

122
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:57,504
Yeah. Ooh! Hey!

123
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,139
Uh, I was kind of

124
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:02,009
wondering if I could tag
along with you guys today.

125
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,844
Uh, don't you have to work?

126
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,429
Well, you know, it's super slow,

127
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:08,265
and Gus said I could. Plus
seeing as I've done

128
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,684
the research, you know, I
know what questions to ask.

129
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:12,519
I think we got this.

130
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,022
Sure.

131
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,324
- (door closing)
- Ok, so don't freak out.

132
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,277
Our friend, Henry, I
spent the morning testing him,

133
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,279
and it's offish. He is...

134
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,530
What? Doc Holliday?

135
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,480
You knew and you didn't tell me?!

136
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:28,607
Well, I bet he can help us.

137
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:30,003
Look, I don't think so. OK, Wynonna?

138
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,706
I followed him to a
secret meeting with Bobo Del Rey.

139
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,626
And something happened.

140
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,544
Oh, my God, what did he do to you?

141
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,180
He kind of shot at my head.

142
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,715
And there was some pinching.

143
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,375
- Let's just talk about this.
- You threatened my sister!

144
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:47,554
- What's to talk about?
- I will confess only to this,

145
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
a sorry state of
finances, which compels me

146
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,642
to ply my trade.

147
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,810
- Dentistry?
- No. My other trade, poker.

148
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,646
Now, I have spied, lurking
in those dark corners,

149
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:58,315
a number of
revenants, so my aim was to steer

150
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,317
little sister from their foul company.

151
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:02,152
Back up a sec.

152
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:05,072
You're saying Bobo's hiding revenants
in the trailer park?

153
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,407
I'm only speculating on a hypothesis.

154
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,660
All right, I get it. But let's just say,

155
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,879
hypothetically, that I was looking

156
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:13,714
for a certain revenant,

157
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:15,999
let's call him Father Malick,

158
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:18,001
should I look in the trailer park?

159
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:21,054
Hypothetically? I'd say yep.

160
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:24,141
So who told you Malick's here?

161
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,426
Not at liberty to discuss.

162
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,562
So it's your friend Henry? One
of these days I'm gonna have

163
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:30,564
- to meet this guy, right?
- One of these days you will.

164
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,127
- Let's go "talk" to Bobo.
- Look, I

165
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,567
know you got a score to settle.

166
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:36,270
You think? Give me one good reason why

167
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,605
I shouldn't just walk in
there and shoot Bobo in the face.

168
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,607
Because we're outgunned and outnumbered.

169
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:46,780
Rules of engagement... we do
not fire unless we are fired upon.

170
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:49,416
- Yeah, but if I take him out?
- Then, you'll die

171
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,868
- in a hail of gunfire.
- Blaze of glory.

172
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,670
More like a blaze of stupidity.

173
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,455
If you want to win this war,

174
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,457
- we do it my way.
- Party pooper.

175
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,466
Bobo.

176
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,438
Wynonna Earp.

177
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:16,226
Hello.

178
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:17,811
It's been a while.

179
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,983
No?

180
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,401
I see.

181
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,205
Baby sister has better manners.

182
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,990
- Don't talk about Waverly.
- Why is that?

183
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,460
It's not like I'm a
stranger to your clan.

184
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,582
I knew your Daddy Ward very well

185
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,834
- while he was alive.
- Yeah, you know

186
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,136
- damn well how he died too.
- Now you see,

187
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,492
that's that wild
imagination, always gets you into trouble.

188
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,522
You'd think that after all the months in

189
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:48,642
St. Victoria's Psychiatric,

190
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:51,511
you would know the
difference between what is real

191
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,513
- and what ain't.
- OK.

192
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,515
So you want to get real?

193
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,234
Yeah.

194
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,525
Black star.

195
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,828
Wow!

196
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,496
You're a long way from home,

197
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:12,165
Marshal, uh... "Dolls."

198
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,117
Deputy Marshal Dolls.

199
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,837
And you don't

200
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:19,589
have much in the way of, uh,

201
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:22,592
back-up. Just one crazy girl.

202
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:25,545
"One crazy girl" and a very big gun.

203
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,383
Look, this badge is
all the back-up I need.

204
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,436
One phone call and I can cause
your world a whole lot of pain.

205
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,388
Let me guess,

206
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,723
black choppers,
Tomahawks and one steaming crater

207
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,725
in the ground. Am I right?

208
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,862
Did you know I had friends in Maldito.

209
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:44,398
We're looking for Father Robert Malick.

210
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,234
We thought you might know where he is.

211
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,153
Say... I did know

212
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,289
where Father is,

213
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,324
and let's say that I gave you

214
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,377
permission to speak to him,

215
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:00,297
I would suspect that if
he came to harm in any way,

216
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:03,250
there would be, uh, consequences.

217
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,886
(guns cocking)

218
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:09,005
Now, the good Father doesn't
believe that cleanliness

219
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,924
is next to Godliness, so you will find

220
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,926
his tent by way of smell.

221
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,145
Oh.

222
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:17,848
You have my permission.

223
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:25,989
We'll see you soon, Bobo.

224
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:28,108
Time will tell.

225
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:30,110
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

226
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,289
(insects buzzing)

227
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:45,926
(Dolls coughing)

228
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,047
Robert Malick?

229
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:54,017
- Father Malick to you.
- We're here to talk

230
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,520
- about Megan Halshford.
- Sounds like a whore!

231
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:59,639
Then again, you're all whores.

232
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:02,809
You had me at whore. Still,
would you take a look?

233
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,566
Struck down by the
blade of immortal reckoning.

234
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:11,451
It was her guilt sharpened the knife.

235
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,456
Always the guilt.

236
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,792
- Guilt about what?
- Sinners sin.

237
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,161
Killers kill.

238
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,130
Whores whore!

239
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:25,582
Only she can tell you why she needed

240
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,634
- to repent.
- Is that why you killed her?

241
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:30,587
Me?! I'm always here,

242
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:33,590
ever since they took my legs!

243
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,510
OK. Put the sheet back on, stumpy,
I just ate breakfast.

244
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,395
(Malick laughing)

245
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,180
So you're not the killer.

246
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,432
But you know him, don't you?

247
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,068
His blade thirsts for you.

248
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:47,654
He will drink from the cup

249
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:50,190
of your sins, whore!

250
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,709
- (Dolls): What just happened?
- I saw him in the mirror.

251
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:17,884
<i>(Dolls): Earp?</i>

252
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,307
He was here, the psycho with the razor,

253
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,693
and on the night of the attack.

254
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,478
He's another one of the Seven.

255
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:31,031
Or Reverend Skanky's not the crazy one.

256
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:36,276
Okay, you think I'm
bonkers, right. Seeing mental shit

257
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,084
like revenants
appearing and disappearing?

258
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:40,946
But as far as we know, they
don't have that power.

259
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:42,034
No.

260
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:44,483
So what? We're dealing with the
David Blaine of revenants?

261
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:46,485
Well, we better not
be 'cause that would be

262
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,070
- a game-changer.
- (ringing)

263
00:12:49,907 --> 00:12:52,208
A neighbour saw a car leave
Megan's home around the time

264
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,826
she was killed. Officer Haught

265
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:55,878
ran the plates, and got us a name.

266
00:12:55,963 --> 00:12:58,497
Samantha Baker.

267
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,049
(imitating gunshot sound)

268
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,051
Samantha "Perky Tits" Baker.

269
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:04,086
Another one of the
Britneys that froze me out.

270
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,340
Let me guess, you two were real close?

271
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:09,258
Like this.

272
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,345
I've barely spoken to
Megan since high school,

273
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:16,015
and out of the blue, she calls me,

274
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,150
says I have to come over right away.

275
00:13:18,186 --> 00:13:20,770
She's freaking right out, saying
she needs to confess.

276
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:21,904
Confess for what?

277
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,107
Sorry, I'm still
trying to wrap my head around

278
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,109
why anyone would
give Wynonna Earp a badge.

279
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:29,862
- Me too, sister.
- What did she need to confess?

280
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,948
OK.

281
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:35,000
On the last day of school in 11th grade,

282
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:37,586
there was this big bash.

283
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,922
You were there, right? Getting destroyed

284
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,373
as usual?

285
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,708
Go on.

286
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:44,593
I remember walking home,

287
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,379
seeing the red lights, spinning.

288
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:51,767
The officer talking to my mom.

289
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,853
My dad was killed in a hit-and-run.

290
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,471
I remember.

291
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:58,023
Last I heard, they didn't
find the person responsible, right?

292
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,192
That's what Megan
wanted to confess to me.

293
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:04,396
It was her. She was the one.

294
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,366
She begged me to forgive her,

295
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:10,202
- like her life depended on it.
- So did you?

296
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:13,405
She killed my dad.

297
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,324
And some people you
just can't forgive...

298
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:18,961

Yeah, we have all made mistakes, friend.

318
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,938
I have spent many a night

319
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,940
wherein I ruminated on
the errors I've made.

320
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:23,943
But then it strikes me,

321
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,978
it was the wrongs done
to me that put me down

322
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:28,397
the well of
tribulations. So I set myself

323
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,816
upon a mission of
vengeance. And let me tell you,

324
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,618
friend,

325
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:34,537

331
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,673
Forgiven? Or not?

332
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,842
(unsettling music)

333
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:15,778

No. No.

338
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,554
No!

339
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,523
No! No!

340
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,725
This is why I never
wanted to come back here.

341
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:49,528
Spit it out, Earp. We
don't get overtime.

342
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:51,530
OK, I was 16 and fresh out

343
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:53,532
of my 8th foster home,

344
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,067
and even for Purgatory High,

345
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:57,069
Megan was... Ugh!

346
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:00,990
You know, her dad owned
the local slaughterhouse,

347
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,908
and she used to fill

348
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,994
my locker with entrails.

349
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,962
Every Friday.

350
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:09,965
Because my clothes were
wrong. Because I'd been in juvie.

351
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:12,885
Because I was the crazy
girl who killed her own father.

352
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Where are you going with this?

353
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,424
Uh, that bash Samantha talked about...

354
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:20,759
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I was there.

355
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,728
But I wasn't getting wasted,

356
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:25,264
I was hooking up with
Megan's boyfriend, Brad.

357
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,434
Didn't even like him. Really.

358
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,436
I just wanted to hurt Megan

359
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,438
the best way I knew how.

360
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,441
And so she found
me on top of him, and...

361
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:38,911
Payback's a bitch. She lost it.

362
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:41,363
Bawled her eyes out, total mess.

363
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:43,415
Grabbed Brad's car keys and peeled out.

364
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,336
Problem is
Megan... (clearing her throat)

365
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:49,088
Megan couldn't drive.

366
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:52,791
And I never thought about how she
got home that night, and now

367
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,426
- I find out...
- Wynonna...

368
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:56,382
No, stop. I have heard
that tone my whole life.

369
00:17:57,682 --> 00:18:00,299
Actually, I was gonna
say you were only 16.

370
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,773
We all make mistakes.

371
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,180
It's the most un-Dolls
thing you've ever said to me.

372
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:12,561
(small chuckle)

373
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:14,363
Pardner, they're looking

374
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,315
to settle up the tab.

375
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,290
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

376
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:32,297
What a shit.

377
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:38,470
Waverly, I can explain.

378
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,701
There is a face that I
didn't want to see again.

379
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,463
Jay Novak, my probation officer.

380
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:48,944
Why would your friend Henry kill him?

381
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:51,332
- He didn't.
- The only other person in here.

382
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,009
Yeah, but we know he's
not a revenant, and the killer

383
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,594
- has to be.
- I still don't trust him.

384
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,145
Why not?

385
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:01,683
What are you two not telling
me about your friend Henry?

386
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,904
OK. Guess I'll have to
find out for myself.

387
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:12,611
(Dolls whistling a tune)

388
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,052
Wynonna's told me a lot about you.

389
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,037
Peculiar. She has told me

390
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:24,039
- nothing about you, Mr...?
- Dolls.

391
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:26,625
Deputy Marshal
Dolls. And you're in serious

392
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:28,627
trouble, Henry. You are looking good

393
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,796
for two homicides.

394
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,848
Oh, now, that is one thing we can

395
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,801
- agree on. I do look great.
- You know, I ran your prints

396
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:37,969
through IAFIS, then Interpol,

397
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:40,305
then every single
national database I could think of.

398
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:42,474
And you know what I found on you?

399
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,394
Nothing.

400
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:47,396
You're a non-entity,

401
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:50,399
which means you have no rights.

402
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:52,067
So start talking.

403
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,703
I am a professional card
sharp, Mr. Dolls,

404
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:57,122
so I can read a man's eyes.

405
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:00,575
And I do not like what I see in yours.

406
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:02,160
No shit.

407
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:03,995
- (knock on metallic table)
- Tell me.

408
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:06,047
(chair scraping the floor)

409
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:10,168
Ooh, I see a captain

410
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,170
piloting a ship full of secrets

411
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,389
through a stormy sea.

412
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:16,591
And as a gentleman who
cares about Wynonna,

413
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:18,677
I will recommend that she quit you,

414
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,679
lest she drown.

415
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:23,682
(Dolls laughing loudly)

416
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:27,519
Is Deputy Marshal Dolls laughing?

417
00:20:27,571 --> 00:20:29,855
I've never been so scared in my life.

418
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:34,276
You know what I see in your eyes?

419
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,448
A man who doesn't like small spaces.

420
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,450
You been in prison?

421
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:45,754
Solitary confinement, ooh.

422
00:20:46,707 --> 00:20:48,757
Was that fun?

423
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:52,461
I have said all I intend to say.

424
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:55,764
Mm-hmm.

425
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,849
It's nice talking to you,

426
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,384
"Hank."

427
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,854
(door closing)

428
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,976
You're gonna release him?

429
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,562
He's still a suspect.

430
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:12,814
Earp, when were you gonna tell me

431
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,400
you were kicking it with
the ghost of Doc Holliday?

432
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,738
How did you find out?

433
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:24,326
He's not a ghost. He's
got eternal longevity.

434
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:26,578
I was definitely gonna tell
you before Christmas.

435
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,362
Because then you could be
each other's Secret Santas.

436
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,188
How cute would that be?

437
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:31,049
(knocking on door)

438
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:33,168
- (door opening)
- Poor dead sucker's wife

439
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:34,669
just called, asking for Wynonna.

440
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:37,339
- For me?!
- Did I stutter?

441
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:40,225
I said I wanted to talk to you,
Wynonna, who's this fella?

442
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,260
Boss-man. Package deal.

443
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:44,930
OK, Suzie, start from the beginning.

444
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:47,732
This afternoon, my husband comes to me,

445
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:50,402
says for 10 years he's
been a big time drug dealer.

446
00:21:50,437 --> 00:21:52,354
I thought he was a probation officer.

447
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:54,406
Yeah, well, that's a
good cover, isn't it?

448
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:57,025
Sometimes, Jay would put his
probationers to work too.

449
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,660
Unpaid minions.

450
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:00,662
Making a delivery one
night, I got arrested.

451
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:02,664
Didn't snitch.

452
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:04,833
Got sent back to
juvie for the third time.

453
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:07,238
- Another nail in my coffin.
- Did you know he was dealing?

454
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,421
Oh, a little weed. I didn't know

455
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:11,256
he'd become Purgatory's
answer to Walter White.

456
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,625
Not until today. It was like

457
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:16,628
he'd lost his mind! He
kept going on about this spectre

458
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,464
coming for him, that
I need to forgive him.

459
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,552
And then, the spectre comes to me.

460
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,937
- The mirrors.
- Oh shit, Wynonna.

461
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:27,305
Gives me two hours.

462
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:29,307
I only have a few minutes left!

463
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,142
We need to split up, cover
every reflective surface

464
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:33,945
you can find. We gotta block his
way from going in. Go! Now!

465
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:42,237
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, can it wait?

466
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:44,239
I'm kind of trying to
save your ass here.

467
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:46,825
You're gonna save me, all
right. I need you to forgive me.

468
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,577
Why?

469
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:50,962
Because I... I was to blame for

470
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:53,665
- you being sent back to juvie.
- What?!

471
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:56,418
One day, Jay comes to
me. He says that the police

472
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:59,838
are starting to circle him,
that he's needing something.

473
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:02,173
I called an anonymous tip on you.

474
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:04,759
- You ratted me out?!
- It was you or my husband.

475
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:06,094
You selfish...

476
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,680
You need to forgive
me before it's too late.

477
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,268
Yeah? I don't know that I can.

478
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:14,769
(man's voice): Tick-tock.

479
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:16,321
Tick-tock.

480
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:18,189
Forgiven? Or not?

481
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:21,076
Yeah, I forgive her! OK? I forgive her!

482
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:23,111
(man's voice): No, you don't.

483
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:25,363
Not in your heart.

484
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,750
I can't move!

485
00:23:28,835 --> 00:23:31,036
(whispering) Help me.

486
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:35,206
(man's voice): Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

487
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:37,258
Time's up.

488
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:48,053
I can taste it. Guilt!

489
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:49,521
Gross!

490
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:52,023
Repent, Wynonna Earp.

491
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,808
Two hours to find forgiveness

492
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:56,061
from the souls you've hurt.

493
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:58,480
- (glass shattering)
- Tick-tock.

494
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:04,285
Earp, what the hell happened?

495
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:07,405
She's gone.

496
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:09,457
And I'm next.

497
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,957
It's Simple. I take
peace maker and right

498
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,682
- between the revenant's eyes...
- You shoot.

499
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:18,791
Boom! Back to Hell they
go. This guy can't throw in

500
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:21,213
a reflection clause. That's not fair!

501
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,182
Fair? He's a demon, and
you shot a mirror.

502
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:25,301
Yeah, that he traveled through!
Totally cheating.

503
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:27,273
No, no, no. What I mean
is you shot a reflection,

504
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:30,522
- not the revenant itself.
- So what does that mean?

505
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,308
- Itself, itself, itself.
- Dolls!

506
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,443
Shhh! Just give me a minute, OK?

507
00:24:34,478 --> 00:24:36,395
OK, but too many more
minutes, and he turns me into a plate

508
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,948
- of sashimi.
- Unless we transmogrify him.

509
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:40,950
Do you come with a translation app?

510
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,118
We have to draw him from his
reflection to make him flesh

511
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:46,121
- and blood. Yes!
- So we need

512
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:49,124
his body? How hard is that for
you to say, "We need his body"?

513
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,320
I've encountered this before
at the BBD. In Kandahar,

514
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:54,296
we dealt with an
Iblis with a similar power.

515
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:56,165
You were fighting
demons in the Middle East?

516
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,717
Now, the ritual wasn't a
total success, four people died.

517
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:01,170
That's like saying the
Titanic almost made land.

518
00:25:01,222 --> 00:25:02,805
But I know why it failed.
They didn't have the right tools.

519
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,807
But leave that to me. That is plan A.

520
00:25:04,842 --> 00:25:07,476
- And what's plan B?
- You need to find

521
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:09,228
everyone you've hurt and
beg for their forgiveness.

522
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:11,597
- It didn't work for the others.
- That's why it's called plan B.

523
00:25:11,682 --> 00:25:14,516
We need the killer's
name. It's very important.

524
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:16,101
I'll put Waverly on it.

525
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:18,437
Meet me back here in 90 minutes.

526
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:21,190
- Also, bring extra hands.
- Dolls!

527
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,994
How bad is this?

528
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:27,913
I'll get what we need.

529
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:32,868
Here I go!

530
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,837
Plan B for begging.

531
00:25:34,872 --> 00:25:37,539

532
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,511
Pete. Pete?

533
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,547
Oh, my God! Hey, it's
been a long time. Can we talk?

534
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,549
I'm kind of busy, Wynonna.

535
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:49,518
- Hey!
- Hey!

536
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:50,996
I know it's been, like, a million

537
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:52,354
years since we dated, but, um,

538
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,141
remember your 19th birthday
party? I left early.

539
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:58,060
- You said you had cramps.
- Yeah.

540
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:00,813
- "Mega cramps."
- Mega lied. I, uh...

541
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,148
Oooh, I

542
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:05,868
- I went home with another fella.
- Bro, the table's

543
00:26:05,903 --> 00:26:07,619
- getting cold.
- Shut up, Kyle.

544
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:10,739
Who'd you go home with?

545
00:26:10,825 --> 00:26:12,875
Hmmm... Ohhh...

546
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:15,544
Brother.

547
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,579
You are such a shit, Wynonna!

548
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:23,635
Wait! You have to forgive... me.

549
00:26:24,722 --> 00:26:26,722
Hey, what just
happened with the York boys?

550
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:29,641
Funny story, g-good
story. Uh, we found the killer.

551
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:32,428
He gives his victims two hours to, uh,

552
00:26:32,513 --> 00:26:34,897
be forgiven for their
sins, or he cuts them up!

553
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:36,899
- Oh, not that funny!
- He also travels through

554
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:38,684
mirrors, and guess who
his next victim is.

555
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,009
Wynonna, we need to get you
on the first bus out of town!

556
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:43,405
No, I'm done running. And
there's a lot of mirrors

557
00:26:43,441 --> 00:26:45,607
on busses. God, I hate busses.

558
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,776
- OK, what's the plan?
- OK. I need you

559
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:49,828
to find the revenant's original
human name and then

560
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,748
meet me back at Black Badge. Dolls
says we need extra hands.

561
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:54,833
Wait! For what? Hey, Wynonna,

562
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,336
- I need more to go on!
- Uh...

563
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,789
Uhhh, scary guy, mutton chops.

564
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:03,292
Sorry, I'm supposed to go
find all the people I've hurt

565
00:27:03,344 --> 00:27:05,094
and beg their stupid forgiveness!

566
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:08,097
- But everyone hates you Wynonna!
- I'm aware.

567
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:18,724
I used to get a good night's sleep
in the old grey-bar hotel,

568
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,309
but now it's pure torture.

569
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:23,062
Which I gather you've
come to enjoy watching.

570
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,030
You said some really mean things.

571
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:26,982
You tracked me like
a common horse thief.

572
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:29,535
- Then you shot at me.
- No, I shot near you.

573
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,071
Nonetheless, I regret the episode.

574
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:33,989
Is that why you came down here?

575
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,290
No. No.

576
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:37,292
I come with a proposition.

577
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:40,412
You saw the revenant,
right? The guy in the mirrors?

578
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:43,665
So you help me identify
him, I'll get you out of here.

579
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:44,666
Ha!

580
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:47,302
I will most happily oblige.

581
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:49,888
OK. Here.

totally not supposed to have.

00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:58,981
Waverly, you have put
together the most thorough resource

585
00:27:59,016 --> 00:28:02,601
on the revenants. You are one
natural-born investigator,

586
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:04,603
just like your great-great-granddaddy,

587
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:06,605
and I reckon, the true keeper

588
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,607
of the Earp flame.

589
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:10,859
Can't blame you for being miffed.

590
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:13,862
What? "Miffed"? Who said I was "miffed"?

591
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,531
Well, I'll be damned.

592
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,866
Here.

593
00:28:17,918 --> 00:28:19,751
This is the face of the man I saw.

594
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,541
- "August Hamilton"?
- Everybody went to see Auggie

595
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,458
for a shave and to confess their sins.

596
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:28,234
What was he?

597
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:30,429
- Like, the Father Confessor?
- Well, in a town

598
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:32,514
with no church, you needed
one. But Wyatt found out

599
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,134
about a cattle rustler
who confessed his crimes

600
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,386
to ole Father Auggie.

601
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:40,055
So Wyatt aimed to put
Auggie on the witness stand.

602
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:42,524
Let me take a wild guess.

603
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,527
- Auggie never made it to court?
- Mm-mm.

604
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:47,813
Disappeared the night before the trial.

605
00:28:47,898 --> 00:28:50,399
People say foul play was involved.

606
00:28:50,451 --> 00:28:52,985
Wait. How can August be a revenant,

607
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,987
I mean, if Wyatt didn't kill him?

608
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:57,156
Oh, but he did. Most definitely.

609
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:59,124
See, by forcing him to testify,

610
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,126
Wyatt signed his death certificate.

611
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:08,333
- Wynonna needs my help.
- Hey, you promised my release.

612
00:29:11,722 --> 00:29:13,055
You know,

613
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,973

You let me out of here,

616
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:21,847
we go see him
together? He won't mind a bit.
