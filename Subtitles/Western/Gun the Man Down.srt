1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,550
There it is.
$40,000 just sitting
there waiting for us.

2
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:19,087
All we have to do
is ride in and get it.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,754
Now, this is the
main teller's cage.

4
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,856
He's got a sawed-off
shotgun under the counter.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,093
Farley, you'll see
he never gets his
hands on it.

6
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:27,695
Rem, you keep one eye
on the Sheriff's office
across the street,

7
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,397
And the other on
the bank guard.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,899
Here, once we're
inside, I'll move
straight to the vault.

9
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,367
Farley, you cover me.

10
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,035
Shouldn't take more
than five minutes,

11
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,437
If everything goes right.

12
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,671
What if it doesn't?

13
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,373
Then it's every
man for himself

14
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,175
And we'll get back
here to the cabin
the best way we can.

15
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,710
Let's get moving.

16
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:59,127
Rem, are you sure
you want to go
through with it?

17
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,062
Too late to
back out now.

18
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,332
What if something
goes wrong?

19
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,439
Nothing is going to
go wrong, Jan.

20
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:15,809
We get our hands on
that money, everything's
going to be all right.

21
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:16,844
Oh, Rem.

22
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,414
MATT: Come on, Rem.

23
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,722
You be ready to leave
as soon as I get back.

24
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,291
Be careful, Rem.

25
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,400
(GUNSHOTS)

26
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,124
Get those saddlebags
and canteens under the horses.

27
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,225
Right.

28
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,327
What happened?

29
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,295
What does it look like?

30
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,899
He's lost a lot of blood.
We'll have to...

31
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,067
There isn't time.

32
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,235
We've got to take time.

33
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,571
I killed a man
at the bank.

34
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,573
I couldn't help it.
The fool went
for his gun.

35
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,074
The whole town
came alive.

36
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,743
There was a lot
of shooting.

37
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,910
He can't be moved.

38
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,145
That we know.

39
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,415
Then we'll have to stay.

40
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,318
Don't be crazy. There'll be
a posse riding down on
this cabin in a few minutes.

41
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:45,919
You're not going
to leave him.

42
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,488
Well, we can't take
him with us. If we do,
he'll slow us down.

43
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,689
We'll all be caught.
What'll that prove?

44
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:50,524
He wouldn't leave you.

45
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,259
Maybe not,
but we got our hands
on a lot of money,

46
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,261
And I'm not
going to spend it
at the end of a rope.

47
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,129
I won't leave him.

48
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,699
Then stay. Stay and watch
them drag him out to the
nearest tree and hang him.

49
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,701
No, Matt. I won't
leave him!

50
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,536
You're going with us.

51
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,709
I've always
admired this horse.

52
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,479
Besides, Remmy ain't
going to need it.

53
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,982
I'm not going
to leave him.

54
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,850
Yeah, that little
affair's over.

55
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,386
Now it's my turn.
Oh, you...

56
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,154
Hold it, Farley.

57
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,023
Two of us might
get together to
spend this money,

58
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,792
But now's no
time to decide it.

59
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,893
Let's go.

60
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,761
(COMMANDING HORSE)

61
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,075
(HORSES APPROACHING)

62
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,320
Still warm.
Let's go in.

63
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:17,237
I heard someone in
the bank say those three
got away with over $40,000.

64
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,339
Poor old Bill.
They shot him right
through the middle.

65
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,242
Well, you wouldn't
catch me going for
my gun the way he did.

66
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,077
They could
have the money.

67
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:28,115
Slim says he thinks
he hit one of them as
they rode out of town.

68
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,349
One of them has
got a hole in him.

69
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,653
That'll slow 'em down.
Come on.

70
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,856
SHERIFF: They'll be
traveling slow.
One of them is wounded.

71
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,599
SHERIFF: Come on.

72
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,734
Sheriff.

73
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,379
Tell us, where are they?

74
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,114
It's no good, Sheriff.

75
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,183
You and Charlie get
him in to Doc Turner.

76
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,418
The rest of you,
come with me.

77
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,595
Any luck, Sheriff?

78
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,429
They headed south
of the Pedro.

79
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,464
We lost them
in the dark.

80
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,603
He's one of them, all right.

81
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,883
Well, what do you
have to say for
yourself, mister?

82
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,052
There's not
much I can say.

83
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,288
You plain-face admitting
you rode with them
that held up the bank?

84
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,190
Would it do me
any good to deny it?

85
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,059
What about
the others?

86
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,460
What about them?

87
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,630
They rode off
and left you,
didn't they?

88
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,932
Did they?

89
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,935
Man did me that way,
I'd get even if I could.

90
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,938
I plan to.

91
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,240
What names they go by?

92
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,208
Who?

93
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,544
Now, you look
here at me, mister.

94
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,979
Only thing keeping you
from a hang rope,

95
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,382
Is that bank teller
being too ornery to die.

96
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,817
But that don't mean
we can't turn that key

97
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,053
And keep you jailed
up here till hell freezes.

98
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:51,058
Look, young man,
those others, they
got off with $40,000.

99
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,894
So having you
means very little to us.

100
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,229
The important thing
is the money.

101
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,931
Meaning?

102
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:01,635
Meaning that folks
about here had almost all
they owned in that bank.

103
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,336
Just natural they'd
take kindly to you

104
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,074
If you was to tell us
who the others were
and where to find them.

105
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,075
I can't do that.

106
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,176
You mean you won't?

107
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,845
I mean I can't.

108
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,247
I don't even know
where they are.

109
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,516
You asking me to believe
that you outlawed
with those gents?

110
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,919
I'm not asking you
to believe anything.

111
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,354
But you could give
the Sheriff here
their names.

112
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,323
Their description.

113
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,159
If I did that,
he might catch up to them

114
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,531
Before I did.

115
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,002
Well, mister,
you ain't leaving
us much choice.

116
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:38,371
Facing a robbery
charge alone,
gonna go hard on you.

117
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,678
Not as hard as it's
gonna go on them.

118
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,127
(WHINNIES)

119
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:08,962
I see him.

120
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,916
Hello, Rem.

121
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,451
Hello, Billy.

122
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,290
Ain't seen you
around much lately.

123
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,092
I ain't been around.

124
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,629
That could be a reason.

125
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,431
Coffee?

126
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,099
Yeah.

127
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,850
Lot of lonely
country out here.

128
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,719
Peaceful, though.

129
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,190
Makes a man quiet inside.

130
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,962
You still killing, Billy?

131
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,832
I'm alive.

132
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,734
Are you?

133
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,139
Much as you.

134
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:31,344
I dug a grave for a man
back in Palace City
a year or so ago.

135
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,447
Folks there were
saying words
about a holdup,

136
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,350
And how the others
rode away rich,

137
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,019
Left you in jail.

138
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,488
That a fact?

139
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,425
Something like that.

140
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,262
You found him yet?

141
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,365
Who?

142
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,035
Matt Rankin.

143
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,873
(SIGHS)

144
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:03,210
You make good
coffee, Billy.

145
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,345
You know, that's the trouble
with this territory.

146
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,846
It's too big.

147
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,051
Man goes looking
to find somebody,

148
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,353
It can take him
near forever.

149
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,058
Yeah.

150
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,928
Thanks for the coffee.

151
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,740
Rem, you tried
Gunther Wells?

152
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,384
Sun ain't half high,
already we got us
a scorcher.

153
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,486
Yeah.

154
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,056
It's just too blamed hot
in this country.

155
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,225
Getting hotter
all the time.

156
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,294
Sure seems that way,
don't it?

157
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:31,598
One of these days,
so help me, Lee,
I'm going to ride north.

158
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,101
Up toward Montana
and that way.

159
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,736
They say a man
can freeze out there.

160
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,638
That sure
would be nice.

161
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,073
Yeah.

162
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,443
Well, leastways the heat
keeps the peace.

163
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:46,579
Too blamed hot
for people to go
breaking laws.

164
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,681
See you at
the office, Lee.

165
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,187
Sheriff?

166
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,227
Look.

167
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,198
Know him?

168
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,234
Never saw
him before.

169
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,051
Morning.

170
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,552
Morning.

171
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,555
Town seems deserted.

172
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,723
Everybody's in the shade.

173
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,892
That sun pours down
on a man.

174
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,397
Yeah, I hadn't noticed.

175
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,867
I'm Sheriff Morton.
This is my deputy, Lee.

176
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,069
Howdy.

177
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,870
Howdy.

178
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,638
You got a name?

179
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,207
Anderson.

180
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,908
Remington Anderson.

181
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,410
Heard of you.

182
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,213
Where's your hotel?

183
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,449
Down the street
on the right, just
past the saloon.

184
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,521
Well, be seeing you.

185
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,626
That's more than likely.

186
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,936
Yeah. It's gettin'
hotter all the time.

187
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,098
Thought I told
you to knock.

188
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,433
Rem's in town.

189
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,535
What?
I said, Rem's in town.

190
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,374
Then you're crazy.

191
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,142
I tell you,
I saw him.

192
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,144
What are we
going to do?

193
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,449
That's up to Rem.

194
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,451
Well, we can't
just sit here.

195
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,885
You got any
better ideas?

196
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,354
Maybe.

197
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,955
Maybe if you
went to him.

198
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,691
Sure. Sure,
I'll go to him.

199
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,661
Walk up, slap him
on the back, and say,
"Remember me?

200
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,897
"I'm the one who left
you behind. The one you
went to jail for."

201
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,199
What about the girl?

202
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,967
What about the girl?

203
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,637
Well, leaving Rem
behind, that was
bad enough,

204
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,205
But when he
finds out that Jan
and you have been...

205
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,906
Been what, Farley?

206
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,845
Look, he has a
fair quarrel with me.

207
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,882
But I'm not about to
get myself dead for
somebody else's woman.

208
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,917
I'm pulling out.

209
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,953
You ought to
do the same.

210
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,261
I wonder how far
he'll get.

211
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,597
What was
that all about?

212
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,069
Rem's in town.

213
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,047
You haven't forgotten
him, have you?

214
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,283
I tried.

215
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,286
You're a witness to that.

216
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,755
Yeah, I guess I am.

217
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,425
Not now, Matt.

218
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,161
Jan.

219
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,469
If you've got any ideas
about going back to him,
forget them.

220
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:40,707
There's probably only
one person in the world
he hates more than me.

221
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,774
You.

222
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,054
(HORSE WHINNIES)

223
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,499
Hello, Farley.

224
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,697
Look, Rem...
Shut up.

225
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,298
Where's Rankin?

226
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:49,936
Where's Rankin?

227
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,471
In the saloon.

228
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,039
Jan...

229
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,607
Jan's with him.

230
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,342
All right,
you get back there,
and you tell him

231
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,210
They're not going
to have a chance to
run out on me this time.

232
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,311
Sure.

233
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,456
Sure. I'll tell him.

234
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,419
What was that all about?

235
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,722
He was riding my horse.

236
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,757
Just a minute,
young fellow.

237
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:49,328
This town may not look
like much to you, but we got
laws and I enforce them.

238
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,263
You going to
arrest me, Sheriff?

239
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,732
I figured on it.

240
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,501
What for?

241
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:58,170
I seen that Farley
fellow riding this horse
for near a year.

242
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,973
Well, I got a bill of
sale on this animal.

243
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,776
Description,
markings, brand.

244
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,480
He's even got my initials
on his saddle.

245
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,782
You saying Farley
stole your horse?

246
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,751
I'm saying he
was riding him.

247
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,587
Meaning you don't
intend to charge him
with horse taking?

248
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,288
That's right.

249
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,725
You need me,
I'll be at the hotel.

250
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,134
What do you
make of him, Sheriff?

251
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,902
I ain't at all sure.

252
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:43,883
Well, I guess
we better go over
to the saloon

253
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,653
And find out if that
Farley's got a bill of
sale for that animal.

254
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,120
No need.
No need?

255
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,488
No.

256
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,057
Maybe that Anderson
fellow was lying.

257
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,792
Maybe.

258
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,561
Still wouldn't do
no harm to check.

259
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:56,529
Look, I figure if
Farley had a bill,

260
00:24:56,563 --> 00:25:00,199
He would have come storming
into my office, demanding
I do something about it.

261
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,168
Anderson beat him
clear of it.

262
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,236
Say, that's right.

263
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,839
Never thought of that.

264
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:10,677
It's sure a mighty
funny way to let a fellow
know he's riding your horse.

265
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,378
Tell you what, Lee,

266
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:16,148
You keep an eye on
the saloon and that
young fellow in the hotel.

267
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,717
I'll be in the office.

268
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,886
Let me know if you see
anything out of the ordinary.

269
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,721
Sure thing, Sheriff.

270
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,392
It's sure going to
be a scorcher.

271
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,516
Are you sure
that's all he said?

272
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,384
Well, ain't
that enough?

273
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,887
You ask me,
come dark, we ought
to pull out of here.

274
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,056
A day will put us in...
No.

275
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,557
But why can't...
Shut up.

276
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,026
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

277
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,127
RANKIN: Yeah?

278
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,231
He still hasn't come
out of the hotel.

279
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,966
He will.

280
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,434
Look, Rankin, I don't
know about you,
but I want to get...

281
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,069
Jake.
Yes, sir?

282
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,138
Can you find Billy Deal?

283
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,607
JAKE: Guess so.

284
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,945
Why don't you just
shoot him in the back
and get it over with?

285
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,614
What am I supposed
to do? Run?

286
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,149
You did, once.

287
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,186
Well, Mr. Rankin?

288
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,431
Find him.

289
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,740
Sheriff?

290
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:31,543
That woman, that Miss Janice,
from the saloon,

291
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,212
She just went in the hotel.

292
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,047
She did, eh?

293
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:38,217
Well, you told me to
let you know if anything
out of the ordinary happened.

294
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,652
That's right, I did.
Thanks, Lee.

295
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:47,159
Say, you don't suppose
she knows that Anderson
fellow, do you?

296
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:49,762
She probably does.

297
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:56,202
Well, maybe I'd
better get back and
keep my eyes open.

298
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,937
That's a good idea.

299
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,110
I'll be out in front
of the hotel if you
need me, Sheriff.

300
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,311
Right.

301
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,680
(SLAMS)

302
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,520
I had to see you, Rem.

303
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,224
Get out.

304
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,526
Rem, I can explain.

305
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,096
Explain?

306
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,799
You mean, there's a
reason to run off and leave
a half-dead man to a posse?

307
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,602
There's a reason for that?

308
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,737
I didn't want
to leave you.

309
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,809
But you did, didn't you?

310
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,012
Why?

311
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,119
I...

312
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,789
I've asked myself that
a thousand times.

313
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,525
Couldn't have been
the money, could it?

314
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,528
You can't believe that.

315
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,263
Can't I?

316
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,968
I should have left you
where I found you.

317
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:38,370
In a saloon?
Is that what you mean?

318
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,139
Now, look...
No.

319
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,208
No, you look.

320
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,543
I'm every dirty thing
you think I am.

321
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,378
Only worse.

322
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,915
All right,
so I ran out on you.

323
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:52,151
You think you're the first man
I played for a sucker?

324
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,721
I've rolled drunks
in every cheap saloon
in this territory.

325
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,925
I've cheated and lied
my way, ever since
I can remember.

326
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:02,361
And there's not one
sin I haven't done
at least once.

327
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:05,531
But I loved you.

328
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:09,235
You're the only
clean thing that ever
happened to me.

329
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,537
You wanted to settle down.

330
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,605
Live respectable.

331
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,875
You wanted to own
your own ranch.

332
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:20,947
Then you had to ruin it
by throwing in with
Rankin and his kind.

333
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,582
You wanted to own
your own ranch, all right.

334
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:27,253
But you wanted to steal
the money to buy it.

335
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,389
You're no better
than the rest of us.

336
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,424
I'm sorry I came up here.

337
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,928
Why did you come, then?

338
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,265
Why?

339
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:44,236
Because Rankin
sent for Billy Deal.

340
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,939
He's going to blow
your head off, Rem.

341
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:53,079
And you don't have
to believe that, either.

342
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,383
Sheriff?

343
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,251
Slow down, Lee.

344
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:40,319
Billy Deal's in town.

345
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,487
Billy?

346
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,821
Just rode in,
big as life.

347
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,390
Bigger.

348
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,924
Wonder what
brings him to town?

349
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,694
He tied up and
went into the saloon.

350
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,362
You suppose that
Farley sent for him

351
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,831
'Cause he's sore
about that Anderson fellow
doing him like he did?

352
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,366
Well, it's a thought.

353
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,735
Farley's the kind of man
who wouldn't fight
his own fight.

354
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,538
Yeah, Farley's also
the kind of man who
wouldn't have enough money

355
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,274
To hire Billy to gun a man.

356

Oh, uh, he's six.

359
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,081
Say, you don't
think Billy might be...

360
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,882
Six, huh?

361
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,518
Nice to be six.

362
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,954
Six? Well, yeah,
I guess so. Six.

363
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,589
Nice day today.

364
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:19,925
Why don't you
take him fishing?

365
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,727
Fishing?

366
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,229
Yeah.

367
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:26,265
There's a great big
bass that just sort
of lazes around

368
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:28,734
Under that bridge
at Higgins Crossing.

369
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,437
It's about the
biggest bass I ever
seen in these parts.

Oh, now, Sheriff, look...

371

You be back
before it's dark.

372
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:41,280

there's trouble, I always
have to take the kid fishing.

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,053

be here a long time
after I'm gone.

375
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,055
You can take
care of it then.

376
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,590
You understand?

377
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,560
Yeah. I guess so.

378

Yeah?

389
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,668
He's here to kill me.

391
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,779

at the hotel.

he's buried real good.

No.

wouldn't have you?

what you were.

Just what am I?

465
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,394
A woman.

had to make her way
the best she could,

like we did.

explain it to myself.

explain it to him?

you this, Jan.

it'll be another one.

And if it isn't me,
it'll be another just like me.

486

You may get away living with
the high-minded for a while,

487
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,458
But you'll be back.

488
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,228
Think about that, Jan.

489
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:26,397
Think about it real good.

490

about this, us having to
lock you up and all.

495
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:03,501
Here you go, doing
Billy Deal like you did,

496
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,237
And us treating you
like a common outlaw.

497
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,045
Truth is, we've been trying
to get rid of Billy Deal
ever since I can remember.

498
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,315
Same goes for Rankin
and his crowd.

499
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,884
I ain't at all narrow
thinking, Mr. Anderson,

500
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,687
But some of the things
that goes on up
in that saloon

501
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,190
Make a man blush all over.

502
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:27,225
You wouldn't believe this,

503
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:31,329

when Gunther Wells was as
peaceful and quiet as Sunday,

504
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,531
Every day in the week.

505
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,900
Then this Rankin
comes along.

506
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:39,204
Next thing you know,
folks start drinking,

507
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:41,139
Playing cards,
fighting,

508
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:45,476
Cahootin' all over
the doggone place.

509
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:50,047
Saturday nights,

510
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:54,252
He used to send a whole
wagonload of them gals
from Indian Springs.

511
00:50:56,254 --> 00:51:00,558
It was worth
a man's life to walk by
them swinging doors.

512
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:04,229
I been after the sheriff
to close the place up.

513
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:06,864
He claims there's no law
that says a man can't
run a drinking hall.

514
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,499
Maybe he's right.

515
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:12,337
Where is the sheriff now?

516
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:18,576
Seeing to it
that Billy's put
under proper.

517
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:21,746

will probably read
words over him.

518
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:27,218

going to help Billy
too awful much, though.

519
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,553

520
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,087
No, thanks.

522
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:33,591
Huh?

523
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,127
Oh.

524
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:41,566
Leave it open, Lee.

would never get
through talking.

00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,947
There are things
that sure keep
bothering me, though.

531
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:58,616
That so?

532
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:02,753
You ride into town,
and you find
a missing horse.

533
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:06,691
Then all of a sudden,
Billy Deal comes along
and draws on you.

534
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:07,725
Why?

535
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:09,927
I wouldn't know.

536
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,662
Wouldn't you?

537
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,864
Can I go now?

538
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:15,400
Door's open.

539
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:22,307
Young fellow.

540
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,008
Yeah?

541
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:27,378
Keeping the law
in this town is
my business.

542
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:30,181
I intend to do it,
no matter what.

543
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:31,949
Meaning?

544
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:36,053
Meaning that gunning
a man like Billy Deal in
self-defense is one thing.

545
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,023
Plain killing is
altogether something else.

546
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:41,459
I'll remember that.

547
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,494
You'd better had.

548
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,730
I'd hate to have
to hang you.

549

(HORSES APPROACHING)

550
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,238
I brought the horses.
They're out back.

551
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:02,440
Good.

552
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:04,775
Where's Jan?

553
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,416
I don't know.

554
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,650
You don't know?

555
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,485
That's what I said.

556
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,721
You mean, she's not
going with us?

557
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,055
That's what I mean.

558
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,991
I thought you two
were straightened out.

559
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,527
Yeah, so did I.

560
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,011
(HORSES WHINNYING)

561
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,586
I'm going with you.

562
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,855
You don't have to run.
He won't hurt you.

563
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,958
I don't think anyone
could ever hurt me again.

564

Coffee?

565
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:24,982
You thinking about Rem?

566
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,053
Leave me alone.

567
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:33,758
We get to Sonora,
I'll make you forget
all about him again.

568
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,694
May take time
and money, but...

569
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,796
I said, leave me alone.

570
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,566
It's no use
getting upset.

571
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,003
You could have stayed
behind, and Rem, he might
have even taken you back.

572
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:47,905
Would he?

573
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:50,240
What difference
would it make?

574
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:53,878
You weren't cut out
to be a ranch woman.
It ain't a fit life.

(SCOFFS)

576
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,414
This is, I suppose?

577
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:59,784
It's all in how
you look at it.

578
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:01,919
Take Farley, there.

579
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,455
He hadn't met me,
he'd probably
gone through life

580
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,757
Honest, upstanding
and poor.

581
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,827
By this time,
he'd have more
than likely

582
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,729
Worked himself
to death for
somebody else.

583
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,566
And they'd have to
take up a collection
to bury him.

584
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,468
Same goes
for Rem, too.

585
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:22,272
But you and me,
we like nice times.

586
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:24,108
Like back there,
we had everything.

587
00:57:24,141 --> 00:57:26,811
Money, clothes,
each other.

588
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:32,983
There was a while
back there, I thought
you'd forgotten

All those crazy
ideas about settling
down respectable.

590
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:38,623
Yeah.

591
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,458
So did I.

about us, Jan. We want
something, we take it.

You were the one.

606
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,360
Only one.

607
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,799
We would have
been respectable,
wouldn't we, Rem?

608
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:25,903
Sure.

609
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:29,006

up this early?

says he thinks they
headed for Sonora town.

They'll never
get there.

head start on us.

they're headed.

like fish either.

to get out of it.

to come out the same
way they went in.

when you said

do that Anderson fellow
that way, did you?

Don't seem at all
right to me.
Nice fellow like that.

Probably he had
a reason for all this.

Probably.

for killing, Lee.

guess there is.

have to hang that boy.

to do with him?

brought him in.

meant what you said
about plain killing.

You did right, Rem.

681
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:36,032
Finally.

682
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,712
Take good care of him.

01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:50,379
I will.

be all right.

He'll make
a good citizen.

in our town.
