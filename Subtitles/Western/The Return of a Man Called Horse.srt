00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,936
(Screams)

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,256
(Screaming)

(Yelling in Sioux)

11
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,578
(Screaming and gunshots
continue in distance)

12
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,810
(Whistles)

13
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,779
(Sioux) Take their
horses and young squaws.

14
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,818
Yellow Hands must leave
here or we kill them all.

15
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,696
(Talks in Sioux)

16
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,816
(Shouting, hammering)

17
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,137
Zenas! Zenas Morro!

18
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,132
Viens ici. Les sauvages...

19
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,609
They are coming.

20
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,900
- Gryce.
- Zenas.

21
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,971
It's all over.

22
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,329
Them Yellow Hands won't be
bustin' up your traps no more.

23
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,889
That Owl. Will he work for us?

24
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,373
I don't know. He did a good job this
time. Them that ain't dead's runnin'.

25
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,817
Chemin, tell the chief that he'll be
well rewarded for helping us out today.

26
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,609
Tell him that we claim
all these beaver creeks

27
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,578
and Yellow Hand country
by right of discovery.

28
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,131
Tell him we'll buy the Yellow Hand squaws
and use them around here for slaves.

29
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,212
But put a mark on them so we
can tell them from the Ricks.

30
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,532
And tell Owl him and his Ricks can live
outside the fort. We'll take care of them.

31
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,977
I know that Hudson Bay Company
- they'll be wantin' to move in on the territory,

32
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,051
so you tell this
savage son of a bitch

33
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,691
we'll pay him to protect our trappers
from all hostiles, red or white.

34
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,658
You tell him we'll pay
his Ricks with gold.

35
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,459
(Chemin) They don't
care about no gold.

36
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,531
Then give them some whiskey.

37
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,179
(Weeping and wailing)

38
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,218

(Baby crying)

40
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,698
(Sioux) We leave our
blood on the sacred land.

41
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,776
(Hunting horn)

42
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,696
(Hounds barking)

43
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,416
Here we are! Here we are!

44
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,534
(Huntsmen shouting indistinctly)

45
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,413

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,214
# Sanctify this water, Lord, we pray

50
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,373
# In the fullness of thy grace

51
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,020
# Of thy grace

52
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,378
# O Lord, we pray

53
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,054
# Sanctify... #

54
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,529
Thank you for coming.

55
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,850
I love you.

56
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,252
# In the fullness of thy grace

57
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,412
# Of thy grace

58
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,097
# O Lord, we pray

59
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,176
# Sanctify

60
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,414
# Sanctify this
water, Lord, we pray #

61
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,933
I'm sorry.

62
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,251
# In the fullness of thy grace

63
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,410
# Of thy grace #

64
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,692
Yes.

65
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,930
Denham. Get me Denham.

66
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,576
I see you've made your decision.

67
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,130
Yes, Denham, I have. I'm going back.

68
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,099
- How soon will you be leaving?
- Soon. Right away.

69
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,775
- How long will you be gone?
- How long?

70
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,292
- One year, and no more.
- I understand.

71
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,453
And, Denham, look after the
place for me while I'm gone.

72
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,498
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

73
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,332
Thank you.

74
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,377
(Sioux) Shunkawakan greets
the Yellow Hand people.

75
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,452
(Voice echoes)

76
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,977
(Sioux) A son of the
Yellow Hands has returned.

77
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,576
(Distant hammering)

78
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,656
(Lord John) Hello there!

79
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,012
Could you tell me who the
proprietor of this residence is?

80
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,056
What the hell is that?

81
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,816
Could I come in, please?

82
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,335
Thank you.

83
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,772
Thank you. That's most civil of you.

84
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,091
- Mon dieu!
- Bonjour, monsieur. Comment Ã§a va?

85
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,299
I say, could you look at
the foreleg of my horse?

86
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,336
(Laughter)

87
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,088
Blazing hot, the sun. I brought
this for the rain, you know.

88
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,656
My horse?

89
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,214
Come on. Get up here. Hurry!

90
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,653
See? The woman is ours.

91
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,657
Absolutely not done,
old boy. Not done.

92
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,015
Get off of me!

93
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,335
Gryce! Quiet!

94
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,015
Are you going to waste
your time with that?

95
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,738
What an extraordinary beast.
I'm so glad you stopped him.

96
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,058
- Now, who in God's name are you?
- I am doing a survey of the West.

97
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,371
It appears your president -
Jackson, I believe his name is -

98
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,372
regards everything west of
the Missouri as worthless.

99
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,576
Two dollars, I believe,
is all it's worth.

100
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,050
- So William sent me for a
look-see. - William? William who?

101
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,019
The fourth, old boy.
His Majesty. Our King.

102
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,094
I do beg your pardon. My name is
McClory, Seventh Duke of Kildare. And you?

103
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,819
Morro. Zenas Morro. I run this place.

104
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,779
Ah. And a jolly
little fort it is, too.

105
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,897
You're wrong, friend. This
is a peaceful trading post.

106
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,175
We're friendly to all
trappers and Indians.

107
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,969
How could you be so naive? There is
no such thing as friendly natives.

108
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,370
- I must move on. My horse?
- (Blacksmith) Nothing wrong with it.

109
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,610
Thank you, old boy.

110
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,775
Maybe you ought to
stay here for the night.

111
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,055
Another time, old boy, another time.

112
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,978
- Do you know the Hudson Bay Company?
- No.

113
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,133
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, old boy. Quite sure.

114
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,692
Oh! By the by... As a matter
of historical reference,

115
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,932
what happened to that band of savages,
the ones that were camped nearby?

116
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,853
Something "Hands," they were called.

117
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,488
- Yellow Hands.
- Precisely.

118
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,969
I knew it was some
vulgar colour like that.

119
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,254
They moved on.

120
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,457
I was told that Indians never
leave their sacred burial grounds.

121
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,532
- Well, you were told wrong.
- Oh, good.

122
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,535
I did think it rather unhygienic to
reside amidst one's decaying ancestors.

123
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,334
You knew them, these Yellow Hands?

124
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,059
- Come back here!
- (Screaming and crying)

125
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,259
Now, there's one of your Yellow
Hands. Nothing but trouble.

126
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,252
Open the gates!

127
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,698
You know, fraternising sexually
with a native is not done, old boy.

128
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,055
In the best of circles, that is.

129
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,815
Well, good luck with
your little fort.

130
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,060
Gryce, get your mind off that squaw.

131
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,053
I want you to track that
dandified son of a bitch.

132
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,416
He's a spy for the Hudson's
Bay Company. I swear it.

133
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,568
He's not alone. Find out
who's with him and how many.

134
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,220
Then we'll send out a scalping party.

135
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,298
Son of a bitch. He's alone.

136
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,936
Hey.

137
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,811
(Sioux) Go back, tell Zenas the
Englishman is travelling alone.

138
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,255
I will bring his scalp... Go!

139
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,296
(Lord John whistles merrily)

140
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,020
Get out of here...
(Mumbles indistinctly)

141
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,096
It's you.

142
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,136
(Continues whistling)

143
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,056
What the hell are you doing?

144
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,450
Well, I'm not making
a spot of tea, old boy.

145
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,691
The Yellow Hands. Where are they?

146
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,573
The Ricks massacred them.

147
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,972
- And the survivors?
- There wasn't any.

148
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,173
Where are the survivors?

149
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,535
There was a few women and kids. The
Ricks slaved them and sold some to us.

150
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,536
Where are they?

151
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,217
What the hell difference does it
make? They're gone! They're finished!

152
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,816
Where are they?

153
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,373
South... southeast! Into the
Badlands! Now cut me loose!

154
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,534
Come on! Cut it!

155
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,816
(Yelping and gasping)

156
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,977
(Lord John) Her name was
Wi-Wacapi, by the way.

157
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,853
The young girl you
shot... in the back.

158
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,856
You been here before.

159
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,769
It means "Moonstar".

160
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,858
I knew her when she was twelve.

161
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,093
You'll never see any of your
Yellow Hand friends alive.

162
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,898
My Ricks will track you
down wherever you go.

163
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,009
Shunkawakan.

164
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,140
(Sioux) Shunkawakan has returned.

165
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,055
Come and greet Shunkawakan,
he is one of us.

166
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,736
Don't be afraid.
Shunkawakan is a Yellow Hand.

167
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,092
(Sioux) Chief Lame Wolf...

168
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,252
Remember my son, Standing Bear?

169
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,051
(Continues in Sioux)

170
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:17,090
(Sioux) No horses... no
buffalo... we eat our dogs.

171
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,819
(Speaks Sioux)

172
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,418
(Shouts in Sioux)

173
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,940
(Sioux) I bring gifts for everyone.

174
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,933
Great covering for
head of great chief.

175
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,774
(Shouts in Sioux)

176
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,533
(Clamour of voices)

177
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,296
Here. Here.

178
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,211
(Lord John continues in Sioux)

179
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,176
(lnaudible)

180
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,530
(Sioux) For fighting.

181
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,697
(Sioux) For hunting. For fighting.

182
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,370
(Rattles)

183
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,568
Raven.

184
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,451
Morgan.

185
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,935
Go, friend. There is
nothing here for you. Go.

186
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,576
(Speaks Sioux)

187
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,852
(Old woman calls out in Sioux)

188
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,455
(Sioux) Is it not a good
omen that he returns?

189
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:51,376
No! The evil spirit watches
us... We offer the gifts to him!

190
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,495
(Chants in Sioux)

191
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,816
(Raven continues chanting)

192
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,018
(Raven chanting and wailing)

193
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,377
Sign say Yellow Hand spirit fly away.

194
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,291
Lose sacred rock and
old burial ground.

195
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,814
Cannot go back.

196
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,698
Have no place.

197
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,900
Elk Woman, I have
brought horses, guns.

198
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,050
We'll hunt the buffalo again.

199
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,134
We'll have meat,
teepees, and a new life.

200
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,497
Buffalo spirit gone.

201
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,536
No hunt.

202
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,339
Heart full of pain.

203
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,136
Elk Woman...

204
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,133
to give up hope is to die.

205
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,930
We must wait for
sign from evil spirit.

206
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,010
There is no evil
spirit, only evil men.

207
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,935
Tomorrow, when the gifts I have
brought for the people are returned,

208
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,854
then the Yellow Hands will be
strong again and destroy the enemy.

209
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,096
You talk like white man, Shunkawakan.

210
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,932
Guns no good against evil spirit.

211
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,456
(Chanting and drumming)

212
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,176
(Shouts in Sioux)

213
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,848
(Boys shout)

214
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,894
(Chanting and drumming stops)

215
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,890
Everything is gone.

216
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,336
Gone.

217
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:07,128
Well, if everything is gone,
then the evil spirit is satisfied

218
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,415
and the Yellow Hands are free.

219
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,413
(Speaks Sioux)

220
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,855
He wants more?

221
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,135
You've hidden everything,
haven't you, Raven?

222
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,096
You've hidden everything.

223
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,496
Now, where are they?

224
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,536
Where are they?

225
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,576
Where are they? (Echoes)

226
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,656
(Chants)

227
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,373
- Everybody!
- (Chanting and drumming resumes)

228
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,215
Come up here and help me find
the guns! Help me find the guns!

229
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,258
(Shouts in Sioux)

230
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,010
Elk Woman, help me! Talk
to the people! Tell them!

231
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,934
(Sioux) I have brought horses...
we can hunt the buffalo again.

232
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:28,289
(Sioux) You need the Buffalo
Spirit to fight the men at the fort.

233
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,170
Tell them, Elk Woman! They
must fight back! They must!

234
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,458
Or they will die!
The people will die!

235
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:00,937
Shunkawakan, why you come back?

236
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,854
- You look for something?
- Oh, yes.

237
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,133
Look for something that I
found when I was here before...

238
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,210
the power of the great spirit.

239
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:26,491
I tried to take it back with me to
England, but when I got there, it left me.

240
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,093
And now I'm lost.

241
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,136
I'm lost.

242
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,376
So I came back.

243
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:44,730
I came back, only to find
the people as broken...

244
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,573
and as lost as I am.

245
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,613
All waiting to die.

246
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,135
- We wait for sign.
- For what sign?

247
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,494
For lightning to strike the fort?

248
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,133
If evil spirit go away,

249
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,016
Yellow Hand kill enemy.

250
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,457
Go back to sacred land.

251
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,293
Your enemies are not afraid
of the evil spirit, Elk Woman.

252
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,374
They've got guns, cannon, power.

253
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,533
If Yellow Hands all die...

254
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,020
that is way it will be.

255
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,334
You're not afraid of death?

256
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,458
Are you afraid to die?

257
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,170
You have forgot much.

258
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,296
Elk Woman...

259
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,536
Help me.

260
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,809
- Help me.
- You must forget yourself.

261
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,818
Fast four days and four nights.

262
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,731
Purify your body.

263
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,856
Seek your vision.

264
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,819
You must suffer for the people.

265
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,739
Then you will be reborn.

266
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,772
(Chanting and drumming)

267
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,930
I send my voice to the four
corners of the universe,

268
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,580
to the earth and sky

269
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:13,734
and all that breathes and grows
on the land and flies above it.

270
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,812
In these things, your spirit lives.

271
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:23,930
Send me the vision so I may earn
the right to hold the sacred pipe...

272
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,057
and through it, find the way.

273
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,936
(lmagines piano recital)

274
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,976
(Silent)

275
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,656
(Panting and whimpering)

276
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,852
This is the centre of the universe.

277
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:04,818
It is a circle without
beginning and without end.

278
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:14,058
And in it you will
find your own centre...

279
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:19,737
where there is no future and no past.

280
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,733
(Sioux chanting and drumming outside)

281
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:25,133
The smoke from the sacred
pipe, mixed with my breath,

282
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:29,133
will rise and spread
throughout the universe,

283
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:35,056
and become one with the
breath of the great spirit,

284
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,298
who has now shown me the way.

285
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,735
(Chanting and drumming resumes)

286
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,416
(Drummer speaks Sioux)

287
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:19,898
(Lord John) Oh, WakhÃ¡n ThÃ¡nka,
you see here a sacred place.

288
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:26,698
You see here a sacred
centre which we have fixed,

289
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,214
and in which I shall suffer.

290
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,776
O great spirit,

291
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,694
on behalf of the people,

292
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:40,011
I offer all my suffering.

293
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,056
(Chanting)

294
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,896
(Blows whistle)

295
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,176
(Raven chants)

296
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,890
(Blows whistle)

297
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:49,810
(Sioux) Great Evil Spirit... free us!

298
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,656
(Blows whistle)

299
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:21,656
(Chanting, drumming
and whistling continues)

300
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:44,016
(Chanting and drumming)

301
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,896
(Thunder)

302
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,338
(Screaming)

303
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,976
(Raven chanting)

304
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,618
(Speaks Sioux)

305
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,336
(Raven chanting)

306
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,254
(Sioux) O Thunder God...

307
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,654
Do not destroy the Yellow Hands.

308
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:06,097
I give my life so
the people may live!

309
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:07,613
Stop!

310
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:32,137
- My God.
- Morgan.

311
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,772
Morgan.

312
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:53,538
(Mumbles in Sioux)

313
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:56,418
Shh, Raven, Raven...

314
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:04,899
(Whispering) Raven... the Yellow
Hands have suffered enough.

315
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,936
I understand now.

316
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,256
(Sioux) My people are free.

317
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:56,380
(Sioux) What you have done is sacred.

318
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:06,493
You have suffered for your people.

319
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,935
Now the Great Spirit is within us.

320
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,055
We are reborn!

321
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,735
(Distant animal groaning)

322
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:08,496
(Yelling)

323
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,856
(Shouts in Sioux)

324
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,740
(Screams)

325
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,616
(Rickaree whoops)

326
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,496
(Children shouting)

327
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,738
(Man yelling and grunting,
children laughing)

328
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:40,297
Buffalo give his
spirit to our people.

329
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,655
So the children can play at revenge?

330
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:49,096
No. For fighting.

331
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,776
We're too few, Elk Woman.

332
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,256
We're too few.

333
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,296
(Sioux) Like brothers we share
the smoke of the sacred pipe.

334
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:14,332
All the Lakota people are happy
that our Yellow Hand brothers...

335
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:17,890
again hunt the buffalo.

336
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:26,574
Red Cloud, the Rickarees
who now live near the fort...

337
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:30,130
are strong and keep us from our land.

338
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:35,172
You should fight to the death
to keep your sacred land.

339
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,491
Red Cloud...

340
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:40,856
That is precisely why they're here.

341
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,170
They want help to
fight the white trapper.

342
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:49,377
- White men of river?
- Yes.

343
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,212
Our brothers.

344
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:56,657
Give us knives. Arrowhead.

345
01:21:56,740 --> 01:22:00,619
Take few furs. They give us gun.

346
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:06,889
The white man has come to
strip the land and to own it.

347
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,776
Own land?

348
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,610
How can land be owned?

349
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:17,092
Can man own rock? Tree?

350
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:21,497
Bird? Mountain?

351
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,529
Own man's heart?

352
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:29,659
Where the sun rises and
the great rivers flow,

353
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:35,258
I have seen land and all that
grows there and lives on it

354
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,218
owned by the white man.

355
