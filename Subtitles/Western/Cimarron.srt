through this country.

a big handful of that earth and smell it.

1174
01:35:49,474 --> 01:35:52,136
It's a present to me from Alaska.

1175
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:56,644
And there's a letter in it too. I'll bet you
anything that your daddy's coming home.

1176
01:35:56,814 --> 01:35:58,748
I bet you anything.

1177
01:35:59,851 --> 01:36:01,478
What is it? A bearskin?

1178
01:36:01,653 --> 01:36:06,352
Yes, a lovely bearskin.

1179
01:36:11,262 --> 01:36:14,129
- It's a lovely bearskin.
- What am I supposed to do with that?

1180
01:36:14,298 --> 01:36:16,698
Now, don't be rude.
You know better than that.

1181
01:36:16,868 --> 01:36:19,098
It's not the gift,
it's the thought that counts.

1182
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:22,762
Now, be careful with the letter.
There must be a letter somewhere.

1183
01:36:24,242 --> 01:36:26,369
I don't see any letter.

1184
01:36:29,914 --> 01:36:32,246
Then it's somewhere around.

1185
01:36:38,756 --> 01:36:41,224
Oh, boy, look at this.

1186
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,755
Boy, look at those teeth.

1187
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:49,422
Oh, God, look at these claws.

1188
01:36:51,235 --> 01:36:53,328
Bet he was 8 feet tall.

1189
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,369
Reckon he could eat a man.

1190
01:37:00,478 --> 01:37:03,242
Give my best to your husband
the next time you write to him.

1191
01:37:03,414 --> 01:37:04,472
Yes, I will. Thank you.

1192
01:37:04,649 --> 01:37:06,082
Do you expect him back soon?

1193
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:07,774
Well, it's hard to say.

1194
01:37:07,952 --> 01:37:10,318
He's away on business, as you know.

1195
01:37:10,488 --> 01:37:14,049
It's difficult to foresee the complications
when you're away on big business.

1196
01:37:14,225 --> 01:37:17,592
It must be really big, to keep a man
away from home for five years.

1197
01:37:17,762 --> 01:37:18,786
Good evening.

1198

I am.

Why don't you get married, hmm?

01:38:21,826 --> 01:38:24,090
Is that a proposal?

1213
01:38:24,262 --> 01:38:26,059
It would be, if I had any sense.

1214
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:28,824
Ah, sense. Ha-ha-ha.

Do you know what water is to fire?

1217
01:38:33,905 --> 01:38:36,465
That's what sense is to love.

1218
01:38:36,808 --> 01:38:39,675
Some people in love aren't crazy.

1219
01:38:39,844 --> 01:38:41,368
Love.

1220
01:38:41,546 --> 01:38:45,505
There's love and there's love.

1221
01:38:45,683 --> 01:38:47,446
Me? A woman might love.

1222
01:38:47,618 --> 01:38:52,749
But Yancey,

It all comes out in the wash.

01:39:36,801 --> 01:39:38,359
How can a woman walk like that?

1234
01:39:38,536 --> 01:39:40,060
You'd think she'd be embarrassed.

"It pays to advertise. "

Can I ask you a favor?

01:39:54,352 --> 01:39:56,445
You know everything I've got.

Would you-?

- I mean, would you ask your friend?
- No.

You don't even know
what I'm going to ask you.

Am I stupid?
Does she know where Yancey is, right?

- What else?
- So she does know.

- You have discussed it with her.
- Please, Sabra, don't ask for trouble.

So she does know.

1248
01:40:14,472 --> 01:40:16,940
Well, I better go and ask her myself.

an excuse for my being here.

But I don't think
you'd believe me anyway.

That's good.

1261
01:41:12,296 --> 01:41:14,526
You seem to know me
and how I operate.

...you know, with the heart of gold?

1264
01:41:22,006 --> 01:41:24,406
If I had a heart of gold,
I'd have sold it long ago.

For twice what it's worth.

You want me to know something,

that you know where my husband is.

- And?
- Naturally, I'd like you to tell me.

I mean, I haven't heard from the man
in two years.

I don't know whether he's dead or alive.

Would you address me

- Not without worrying what people think.
- I didn't know I was getting a lecture too.

Is it free?

I don't give nothing free.

1288

In that case, I'd better check the price
before you continue.

Maybe I don't wanna be the governor.

I'll try.

02:17:56,899 --> 02:18:00,858
Sabra, this is Jacob Krubechoff,
the famous sculptor.

1835
02:18:01,036 --> 02:18:02,264
I'm very honored.

1836
02:18:02,437 --> 02:18:03,836
How do you do, Mr. Krubechoff?

1837
02:18:04,006 --> 02:18:05,098
He's the best there is.

1838
02:18:05,274 --> 02:18:07,401
Half a million is nothing
to ask for his stuff.

1839
02:18:07,576 --> 02:18:10,909
He wouldn't even pick up a chisel
for a quarter of a million.

1840
02:18:11,079 --> 02:18:15,015
My work, I'm afraid, doesn't impress them
half as much as my price.

1841
02:18:15,184 --> 02:18:16,845
Oh, dear Mr. Krubechoff.

1842
02:18:17,019 --> 02:18:20,045
The thing is, Sabra-
You know I'm building a university?

1843
02:18:20,222 --> 02:18:24,283
With all the children I got, it's cheaper to
build one than to send them all to college.

1844
02:18:24,459 --> 02:18:29,158
Well, anyhow, I hired Mr. Krubechoff here
to put me up some kind of a statue...

1845
02:18:29,331 --> 02:18:31,799
...something that'll stand
for the Oklahoma pioneer.

1846
02:18:31,967 --> 02:18:33,696
- That's wonderful.
- We got to talking.

1847
02:18:33,869 --> 02:18:35,700
We all decided, the whole committee...

1848
02:18:35,871 --> 02:18:38,806
...that nobody stood
for the spirit of the pioneer like you did.

1849
02:18:39,408 --> 02:18:42,605
So that's how come we wanted
Mr. Krubechoff to talk to you and all...

1850
02:18:42,778 --> 02:18:46,270
...and we thought
maybe you'd pose and everything for him.

1851
02:18:46,448 --> 02:18:48,882
- Am I right, Sol?
- Yeah, yeah, yes, you know.

1852
02:18:49,051 --> 02:18:52,111
Something nice, like you and the little boy
in a covered wagon.

1853
02:18:52,287 --> 02:18:54,619
Something nice, very simple.

1854
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:56,587
But you're out of your minds.

1855
02:18:56,758 --> 02:19:00,751
I haven't decided yet
what should be the best to represent-

1856
02:19:00,929 --> 02:19:02,396
Whatever it is, the spirit...

1857
02:19:02,564 --> 02:19:06,398
...but I would appreciate,
maybe you'd talk to me.

1858
02:19:06,568 --> 02:19:07,967
Talk.

1859
02:19:08,870 --> 02:19:12,101
I'm afraid they have given you
the wrong idea.

1860
02:19:12,274 --> 02:19:15,801
I was just sitting here thinking,
as a matter of fact, you know...

1861
02:19:15,978 --> 02:19:18,947
...nothing really has turned out
the way I thought it would.

1862
02:19:19,114 --> 02:19:21,344
My son and- Look at this.

1863
02:19:21,516 --> 02:19:23,347
That's my son.

1864
02:19:23,518 --> 02:19:27,079
My son, he had to run away to get married,
to do what he wanted to do.

1865
02:19:27,256 --> 02:19:29,349
They won't live
in the same state with me.

1866
02:19:29,524 --> 02:19:32,152
He won't even write me a letter
once in a while.

1867
02:19:33,095 --> 02:19:35,290
And my husband. This is my husband.

1868
02:19:35,998 --> 02:19:38,125
He had to run away too.

1869
02:19:38,634 --> 02:19:40,693
I haven't heard from him
in about 10 years.

1870
02:19:40,869 --> 02:19:42,860
- The newspaper, nothing, noth-?
- The news-

1871
02:19:43,038 --> 02:19:44,699
What's the newspaper? The newspaper.

1872
02:19:44,873 --> 02:19:48,274
Oh, my dear.
I've made it bigger, louder, more profitable.

1873
02:19:48,443 --> 02:19:51,105
Yes, I have made it more profitable.

1874
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:54,408
But it hasn't got the spirit it had
when my husband was here.

1875
02:19:54,583 --> 02:19:57,814
But, Sabra, please,
I mean, this whole thing-

1876
02:19:57,986 --> 02:20:02,446
And that's what you want to symbolize,
the spirit of the pioneer, with me?

1877
02:20:02,624 --> 02:20:03,818
Oh, Tom.

1878
02:20:03,992 --> 02:20:05,550
This is very sweet of you, Tom.

1879
02:20:05,727 --> 02:20:07,024
What Sabra means is-

1880
02:20:07,195 --> 02:20:09,459
I think he knows what I mean.
Don't you?

1881
02:20:09,631 --> 02:20:12,395
- Let's all go and have a cup of coffee.
- I have no time.

1882
02:20:12,567 --> 02:20:14,967
- I'm sorry, I have to-
- Have you got the editorial?

1883
02:20:15,137 --> 02:20:17,367
No, I haven't got the editorial, but-

1884
02:20:17,539 --> 02:20:20,667
I'm trying to squeeze out
something at least.

1885
02:20:20,842 --> 02:20:23,538
- Please forgive me-
- Look, this will take five minutes.

1886
02:20:23,712 --> 02:20:25,179
The newspaper will not run away.

1887
02:20:25,347 --> 02:20:27,542
- You will have a cup of coffee.
- That's enough.

1888
02:20:27,716 --> 02:20:29,081
You might as well go ahead.

1889
02:20:29,251 --> 02:20:31,344
- They've waited this long.
- What's happening?

1890
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:33,579
- Coffee will make us all think.
- Off you go.

1891
02:20:33,755 --> 02:20:36,485
- You are out of your mind, all of you.
- Come on.

1892
02:20:36,658 --> 02:20:37,784
What's come over you?

1893
02:20:38,193 --> 02:20:41,185
You know what I ought to run tomorrow,
in place of the editorial?

1894
02:20:41,363 --> 02:20:43,388

We just go down for a cup of coffee.

1896
02:20:46,201 --> 02:20:48,328
One little woman told me once-

1897
02:20:48,503 --> 02:20:50,300
You remember her, Sol, Jessie?

1898
02:20:50,472 --> 02:20:53,669
Her name was Mrs. Pegler
and she told me-

1899
02:20:53,842 --> 02:20:57,005
It was on the day when her husband
got killed in the land rush.

1900
02:20:57,179 --> 02:20:59,704
" It's not worth it," she told me.

1901
02:20:59,881 --> 02:21:01,280
"I'm a woman," she said.

1902
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:03,748
"Where are my children?

1903
02:21:04,052 --> 02:21:06,714
I'm a woman," she said.
"Where is my man? "

1904
02:21:08,290 --> 02:21:10,781
"It's not worth it," she said.

1905
02:21:11,593 --> 02:21:14,289
And I'm beginning to think
that she was...

1906

"You stick with it, little lady. "
