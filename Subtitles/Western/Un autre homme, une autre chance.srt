1
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,680
ANOTHER  MAN,  ANOTHER  CHANCE

2
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,400
On July 19, 1870...

3
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
...Napoleon III
declared war on Prussia.

4
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,200
He lost the war in 6 weeks.

5
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,400
In Paris, legislative
representatives...

6
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,200
...formed a new government...

7
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,920
...under the presidency
of General Trochu.

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,480
The republic was proclaimed
at the City Hall of Paris.

9
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,600
Empress Eugenie has fled.

10
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,120
The Prussians encircle Paris along...

11
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
...50 miles of continuous front...

12
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,000
...manned by 150,000 troops...

13
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,200
...and 700 artillery weapons.

14
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,360
Paris is completely cut
off from the rest of France.

15
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,600
Two million Parisians...

16
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,720
...deprived of fuel and food...

17
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,320
...are suffering the worst fate...

18
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,520
...the city has ever known.

19
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Horses and household pets...

20
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
...are killed for food...

21
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,920
...so are animals in the zoo.

22
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,520
Butchers sell dog, cat and rat meat.

23
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,320
Today, January 5, 1871...

24
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,120
...Paris is under artillery
attack for the first time.

25
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,160
People are taking
refuge in the cellars.

26
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,720
The Prussians demand a huge ransom...

27
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
...in gold to raise the siege.

28
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Coming down to the cellar?

29
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,560
No...I'm more afraid of crowds...

30
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,120
...than of cannons.

31
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
Will I get to read your diary one day?

32
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,000
No...since it's my diary.

33
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,720
Sure you won't come down?

34
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
- No.

35
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,360
The war deprives
everyone of everything.

36
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
I'm deprived of the
thing I love most...

37
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,840
...music.

38
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,760
It's not a time for concerts.

39
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,760
The news isn't good.

40
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,040
There's no bread to distribute...

41
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,480
...before tonight...at best!

42
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
We're sorry, there's nothing left.

43
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,240
Nothing before tomorrow morning...

44
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,160
...maybe tonight...
we're terribly sorry.

45
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
How can you take pictures of that?

46
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm a photographer...so
I take pictures.

47
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Could you take my picture?

48
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,800
It's for my fiancé.

49
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,720
Come see me later...after the war.
- Thank you.

50
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,320
The first hundred will be served now.

51
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,320
There will be a second
serving this evening.

52
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,360
Later we'll talk of hope...

53
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,880
...and the Promised Land...

54
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,960
Follow me to see it firsthand.

55
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,200
Hey, J.B., I've rarely tasted
anything as bad as this!

56
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,120
Your pessimism is alarming.

57
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,160
A pessimist is an optimist...

58
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,920
...with experience.

59
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,640
After the war with Prussia...

60
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,200
...France will have a civil war.

61
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,800
That's nothing new...

62
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Peace is always harder to win
than war.

63
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,080
"Build your own future...

64
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
...in a new land."

65
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
"America is within reach...

66
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,120
...via the French line...

67
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,360
...in 17 days for 135 francs."

68
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Ever thought of going there?

69
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,360
"Photographer"

70
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,520
Your head there...don't move!

71
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,560
How many pictures do you want?

72
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,200
For my fiancé...his family...five.

73
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,200
That's expensive.

74
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,520
Can I pay you with bread.

75
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
...or any other food?

76
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,960
Well, well...the little baker-maid!

77
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Yes, and I still don't
understand why...

78
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,600
...you took those pictures that day.

79
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,560
Photography wasn't invented...

80
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,080
...just to immortalize fiancées.

81
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,280
Don't move...don't talk.

82
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,120
What does your fiancé do?

83
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,560
What does your fiancé do?

84
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,360
You said not to move or talk.

85
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
If I ask, you can answer.

86
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,680
He's in the military...a lieutenant.

87
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:58,761
- Lieutenant?
- Yes.

88
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,808
I always wanted to cuckold
a lieutenant.

89
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,360
One...

90
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,320
Two...

91
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,520
Three...

92
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,640
Four...

93
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,760
Five...

94
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,600
Come get them next week.

95
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
Finished?
- Yes.

96
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
My most beautiful picture
since the war.

97
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,120
Thank you.

98
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,520
There aren't many cakes like this...

99
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,200
...in Paris tonight.

100
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,480
In honor of the
father of the fiancé...

101
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,280
My first all-butter cake...

102
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,840
...since the war began.

103
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,320
And in honor of the
sister of the fiancé...

104
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
...with the rose!

105
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
And now the time has come...

106
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
...to talk about the marriage.

107
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,520
Here's what I've
decided should be done.

108
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,120
May I say something first?

109
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,120
The fiancée has the floor...

110
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,600
I don't want to get married.

111
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,760
Delivering croissants for breakfast?

112
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,111
Sit down.

113
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,637
I'll get you a blanket.

114
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,720
What is it?

115
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,160
I want to learn to be a photographer.

116
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,800
You came to the right
place... I'm the best in Paris.

117
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,640
And I make the best coffee in Paris.

118
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,760
It's nice of you to take
up photography at 6 A.M.

119
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Are we going to
cuckold the lieutenant?

120
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,600
The noblest part of the
camera: the objective lens!

121
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,680
One drawback: When there's
no sun, It has no memory.

122
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,040
It projects the image upside-down...
I'll show you why...

123
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,640
Sir?

124
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,080
- No sun...no pictures.
-I came about your advertisement.

125
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
All right.
- How are you.

126
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,361
- So this is it...
- Yep, this is it.

127
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:08,260
- Dirty, isn't it?
- Well, uhm... No.

128
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,520
- Photographer?
- Yes...sort of.

129
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,440
Madam.
- Good day to you, Sir.

130
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,720
Do you get lot of sun?

131
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,160
- Two hours...on clear days.
- As much as that...

132
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,800
I'll just have a look...

133
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,520
And the clientele?

134
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,720
Like the sun...like
Paris...like France.

135
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,680
The bedroom...

136
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,440
- How much?
- Two thousand.

137
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,080
- As much as that...
- Know how to haggle?

138
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,360
- A little.

139
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,920
If you haggle, I'll make It 1500.

140
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,640
With all accessories?

141
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,520
Except two cameras I'll take with me.

142
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,560
At 1500, I'd be Interested.

143
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,560
You shouldn't be!
It's falling apart.

144
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,120
I'm handy with tools...

145
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,160
People who aren't intelligent
can't understand...

146
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,520
...even when you tell them
they aren't intelligent.

147
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,920
You mean me?  - Yes.
- 1300 then?

148
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,320
Much better!

149
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
I leave with a clear conscience.

150
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,320
Where are you going?

151
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,800
Where the sun always
shines for photographers!

152
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,760
- Where's that?

153
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,000
- Out West in America.

154
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,600
- Indians!
- One thousand! All right?

155
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,880
Wait a second! One thousand...

156
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,960
Will that get you
there and set you up?

157
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,120
- You bet.

158
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,200
You've just given me an idea...

159
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,880
Maybe I'll leave, too...
instead of setting up here.

160
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,600
Can't you see I'm in
love with this lady?

161
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,600
That I want to tell her to?

162
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,440
I want to take her with me.

163
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
- Very well.

164
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,840
Have a nice trip!

165
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,320
And... Good luck!

166
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,280
You don't know me.
- What?

167
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,800
You don't know me.

168
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,720
I don't know America either.

169
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,600
For the trip.

170
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,680
- What's your name?
-Jeanne.

171
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,960
Could you stop moving for two seconds?

172
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,520
Will we ever see France again?

173
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,360
It's easier to return than to leave.

174
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,160
To talk about the future
spoils the present.

175
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,480
Is there nothing but numbers?

176
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,960
Where we're going we'd better
know how to count.

177
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,960
Not feeling well?

178
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,040
America's starting badly?

179
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,560
- I did an idiotic calculation.
- I'm not surprised.

180
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,640
At age 60, we'll have
spent 20 years in bed...

181
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,760
...3 years at table
and 6 months peeing.

182
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,160
I feel a little like vomiting.

183
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,040
But the sea is calm today.

184
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,920
Must be something else then.

185
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,920
That would be fine with me.

186
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,320
Really?

187
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,440
You know you're charming?

188
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,280
Is that why things happen
to me that I don't expect?

189
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,480
A man...

190
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,680
...a country...and perhaps a child.

191
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,267
- Let me through, please.

192
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:55,681
Excuse me, please.

193
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:58,102
- I'm feeling sick.
- Again!?

194
00:32:58,337 --> 00:33:00,359
- I'm stopping when we reach New York.
- Oh.

195
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,516
- So does the sea.

196
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:03,840
Yes, but I'm staying in 
New York anyway.

197
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,400
Going to lose him at last.

198
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,760
As these pictures show, civilization
has crossed the Atlantic.

199
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,560
The hardest part was the quarantine.

200
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,120
We're getting married soon.

201
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,600
I don't regret France or the fiancé
with the bright future.

202
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,600
Nor your fortune so curiously made
in time of war.

203
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,480
I'm happy, I'm expecting a child.

204
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,440
Tomorrow we start out West by train.

205
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,080
- What are these pictures?
-That's New York.

206
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,520
It looks dirty.

207
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,920
I hope that in time...

208
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,840
...you'll forgive me for
deciding my own destiny...

209
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:09,276
Jeanne.

210
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
- Can't understand a word
- Neither can I.

211
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,400
- Do you love me?

212
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,160
-Yes, I love you.

213
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,200
She loves me.

214
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,760
I don't understand a word you say,
but that's quite a face.

215
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,800
France is full of your
kind...that's why I left.

216
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,600
I wouldn't take your picture.

217
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Want to rob us, huh?

218
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,400
You won't get that...
you won't get my cameras.

219
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,920
- Can we get rid of him?

220
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,280
- I don't know.

221
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,000
What will we name her if it's a girl?

222
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,240
- Sarah.
- Why Sarah?

223
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,800
You're sunburned.
Your nose is all red.

224
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,720
You haven't seen yours.

225
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,400
We're lucky we could go
partway by a wagon train.

226
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,160
Otherwise, it would've
taken us 6 months.

227
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,280
How much time has the train saved us?

228
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,200
Two months.

229
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,640
We still have 4 months in this wagon?

230
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,760
Yes...unless we stop
before we reach the Pacific.

231
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,720
Have you any ideas
about where we might stop?

232
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,920
I'm waiting for destiny
to give me a sign.

233
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,920
Four months...in this...

234
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,920
Is that good for the child
I'm carrying?

235
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,880
It's a hard country...
get it used to a hard life.

236
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,080
If there are Indians,
they're well hidden!

237
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,680
- Make a wish!
- Why?

238
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,400
Because you're going to
see your first Indian.

239
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,120
It's true, they are well hidden.

240
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,720
And?

241
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,800
Since the beginning, I've had a
bad feeling about the wagon master.

242
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,200
What was your wish?

243
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,120
You're not supposed to say your wish.

244
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,200
But there haven't been any Indians.

245
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,800
That we never be apart.

246
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,800
This afternoon,
in one of the wagons...

247
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,680
...a Polish woman read our palms.

248
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,920
I'm always impressed by people
who can see the future.

249
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,200
Where does their knowledge end,
and their imagination begin?

250
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,400
According to her, Francis and I...

251
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,480
...will be the characters
in a melodrama.

252
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,640
The things that happen to us will be
simple and dramatic.

253
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,320
America is the country
where Francis will die...

254
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,680
...and where I will live.

255
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,600
She said that...

256
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,240
...the child I'm expecting,
will be a girl.

257
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,000
She also said that
we'd never see France again.

258
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,040
I'm reassured by one contradiction
in all that.

259
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,880
Why would I live in this country
without Francis?

260
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,320
What's he saying now?

261
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,760
All I know is
he still doesn't like the French.

262
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,200
Three months since we've seen a town!

263
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,760
It's time for your destiny
to manifest itself.

264
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,640
What if that Polish woman was right.

265
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,040
- You'd make a pretty widow.
- Don't joke about such things!

266
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,680
If I can't joke about death,
what can I joke about?

267
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,000
You wouldn't mind knowing
everything in advance.

268
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:41,320
Destiny is only human...
it can make mistakes, too, sometimes.

269
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,200
Anyway, remember what I said
on the boat?

270
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,720
"Let's not spoil the present,
dicussing the future."

271
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,000
- What's he say?
- I can't understand him.

272
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,720
It smells bad.

273
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,760
No, thank you. Go ahead.

274
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,480
No thanks. Come on we're going.
Thank you.

275
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,800
What's he saying?

276
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,640
He's so big.

277
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,400
Don't haggle with destiny.

278
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,120
It's very, very nice.
Yes.

279
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,640
Francis!

280
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,400
The sun's going down
and there's a long line!

281
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,520
Please let me take one.

282
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,840
Oh, it's perfect.

283
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,080
It's a profession.

284
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,560
But there's still that line.

285
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,440
I don't know what to say
to them anymore.

286
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,480
-  Ha?
- I don't know what to say...

287
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,880
Francis!

288
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,720
What on earth is that?

289
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,680
If they won't come to me,
I'll go to them.

290
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,920
- An egg.
- An egg.

291
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,720
- Tomato.  - Domato.
- Tomato.  - Domato.

292
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,629
Domat... Well, close enough.

293
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:53,000
- Chicken.
- Chicken.  - Very good.

294
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,760
- Bread.
- Fred.

295
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,960
- No, not Fred. Bread.
- Fred.

296
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,960
Not exactly brilliant.

297
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,320
I'll repeat it in French.

298
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,120
From now on, you and I will
speak French when we're together.

299
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,680
A promise.
We'll try very, very hard.

300
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,240
Yes? Yes, Mom?

301
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,440
Yes, Mom?

302
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,320
Yes, Mom?
- Yes, Mom.

303
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,120
Oh, yes, Sarah, we must speak French.

304
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,080
Things aren't going very well in Paris.

305
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,920
You'll see Paris one day.

306
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,400
You and I will go for walks together.

307
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,600
Do you want to come? Me, too.

308
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,800
Well, there were Poles...

309
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,560
Russians...

310
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,720
...and French people, too.
Your dad, me...

311
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,520
There were Germans.

312
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:06,200
In fact, it was a German priest
who married us.

313
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,440
You were there, as well.

314
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,960
One day,

315
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,600
I'll tell you exactly where you were.

316
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,240
Do you understand me a little?

317
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,040
You want me to speak
to you in English, huh?

318
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,400
...a long rifle like this...

319
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,200
- Is it finished?
- Yes, it's finished.

320
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,280
I didn't have the courage to go see it.

321
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,080
No one knows why they were hanged?

322
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,400
No, no one knows why...
I'll develop this.

323
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,800
They're all savages.

324
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,560
Good thing you didn't come.

325
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,240
It wasn't pretty to see.

326
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,480
- Francis?
- What is it?

327
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,040
- Open up, please.
- Just a second. It's red light.

328
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,240
What is he saying?

329
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:45,440
He doesn't want to see the picture
of his sons in the newspaper.

330
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:50,400
- Give it to him.
- Right away.

331
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,640
There, it'll be great.

332
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:24,720
Can you say that, ratatouille?

333
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:32,000
Ratatouille. All right, let's eat
ratatouille. It's ready.

334
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,240
There, he got it perfectly.

335
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:12,680
That was very good!
- Thank you.

336
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,880
You want to speak French?
I'll teach you a few words...

337
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,440
- A glass.
- A glass.

338
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,360
- A bottle.
- Hm?

339
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:32,160
- A bottle.
- A bottle.

340
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:39,160
- Knife.
- Knife.

341
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,800
Now for some sentences...

342
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,640
The sky is blue.

343
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:59,720
The sky is blue.
- The sky is blue.

344
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,080
The sky is blue.

345
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,840
Another inversion! I'm fed up.

346
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,880
Even when you make a mistake,
I love you.

347
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:17,440
What's the tritest thing
a man can say to a woman?

348
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,320
Will you marry me?

349
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:18,840
Yes, she was right...
that Polish woman...

350
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:22,680
...I never saw France again!

351
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:32,000
