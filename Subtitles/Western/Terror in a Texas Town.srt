1
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,575
You're too far away for a fair throw, Hansen.
Come a little closer.

2
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,802
Just a little closer in.

3
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,814
You wouldn't want
to disappoint your friends.

4
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,547
They all came here to see blood.

5
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,782
Why don't you bring them in a little closer?
Close, so they can see it.

6
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,516
Please, Hansen.

7
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,595
Five steps.

8
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,598
Two steps.

9
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,667
One, Hansen.

10
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,538
Just one step.

11
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,003
Just close enough so you can get
a fair chance with that meat hook.

12
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,873
How about it, Hansen?

13
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,332
No. That fire was not any accident.
That was arson.

14
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,771
Are you trying to say somebody
here had a hand in it?

15
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,865
I don't think you'd have the guts.

16
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,640
I don't think you've the guts to admit
this fella McNeil had me burned down.

17
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,840
- Take it easy, Brady.
- Take it easy, Matt?

18
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,043
What are you talking about?
Didn't we agree to stick together?

19
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,176
Well, I stuck.

20
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,448
Whose house got burned down? Mine.

21
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,717
Whose barn went up in smoke? Mine.

22
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,123
Whose livestock burnt up? Mine.

23
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,923
No. I'm taking what I got and clearing out.

24
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,157
I thought we all had a clear title here.

25
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,235
Then this McNeil stepped in
and took over half the valley.

26
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,463
I don't know what we're arguing about.
I've got nothing to claim.

27
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,234
This is a matter
that the courts will have to decide.

28
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,832
I say we hold the land any way we have to.

29
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,774
I don't know about you...

30
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,009
but I have over a thousand rounds
of ammunition and I promise you this.

31
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,450
The first McNeil man that steps
on my land, stays there.

32
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,878
Permanent.

33
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,616
Just a minute, gentlemen, please.

34
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,655
If McNeil wants to fight us with the law,
we'll use the law, too.

35
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,629
If he comes at us with guns,
we'll defend ourselves.

36
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,665
Make no mistake about that.

37
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,134
But the important thing is,
are we still going to stick together?

38
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,102
Johnson, how about you?

39
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,842
I just don't know, Mr. Holmes.

40
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:14,606
I'd sure hate to go up against the law.
That is, if McNeil's title is really good.

41
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,842
- What do you say, John?
- I got four kids, Matt.

42
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,045
I have to think it over.

43
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,113
Mr. Hansen, what do you say?

44
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,991
When everybody wants to stick together,
I stick with 'em.

45
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,025
But when nobody don't want
to stick together...

46
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,098
I stick alone, by myself.

47
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,439
Not all by yourself. I am your friend.

48
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,933
I stick too, and my family.

49
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,665
That's quite a layout. For him?

50
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,134
Came packed in ice,
all the way from the Gulf.

51
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,829
- Not bad.
- Please.

52
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,402
He ain't gonna miss just one of these, is he?

53
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,568
Please, Mr. Baxter.
You know how Mr. McNeil is.

54
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,045
All right, Shorty.

55
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,342
- Anything for you.
- Thank you.

56
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,180
You just get me some whiskey, will you?

57
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,378
Coming right up, Mr. Baxter.

58
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,223
- Drink heartily.
- I will.

59
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,588
Shorty!

60
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,158
Yes, Mr. Baxter.

61
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,733
Johnny Crale come in yet?

62
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,530
He just got in. He's up there now.

63
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,320
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

64
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,198
An event like this calls for a toast.

65
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,096
Will you join us, Johnny?

66
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,262
Anything calls for a toast.

67
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,774
- Have you any particular toast in mind?
- I do.

68
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,238
Let's drink to Johnny...

69
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,537
and the success of his mission.

70
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,178
Very good.

71
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,964
You realize conditions have changed a lot
since you and I last worked together?

72
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,866
I can see that.

73
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,563
You've got drapes on the doorway
and lobster on the table.

74
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,105
And 75 pounds more on your belly.

75
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,708
And a new secretary.

76
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,573
Private?

77
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,844
Your wit is as outdated as your profession.

78
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,010
We've moved into a new era.

79
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,657
Killing on the scale you're accustomed to
isn't fashionable anymore.

80
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,321
As long there are men like you,
there'll be plenty of work for men like me.

81
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,193
Especially me.

82
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,325
This is not Waco, and it's not 20 years ago.

83
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,696
I'm in business here. I own this hotel.

84
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,340
Hold title to a 120 sections of land
in this area.

85
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:06,969
Some of it is occupied by squatters
who've lived here 10 or 15, even 20 years.

86
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,946
I'm trying to get them
to leave as peaceably as possible.

87
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,279
I've even paid some of them to get off.

88
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,885
You paid them?
You must be pretty desperate.

89
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,012
No.

90
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,388
In this instance,
I'm quite willing to pay them.

91
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:25,129
However, some of them proved
extremely reluctant to follow my suggestion.

92
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,865
Time presses,
and I've run out of means of persuasion.

93
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,128
So you thought of old Johnny Crale.

94
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,736
Precisely.

95
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,601
I want all land grants
legally signed over to me within a week.

96
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,303
For this, we need an example.

97
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,507
Just one, mind you.
I've no taste for a massacre.

98
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,777
Just what business are we in?

99
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,583
My business.

100
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,256
You mean it will be
when you get your example.

101
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:50,722
You mean it will be
when you get your example.

102
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,922
You'll find the usual envelope
on the bureau in your room.

103
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,465
Is there a sheriff in this town?

104
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,497
Actually, there isn't.

105
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,642
But I have one.
The town likes him and I pay him.

106
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,234
So there'll be no trouble from there.

107
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,338
That takes care of everything
but the example.

108
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,180
What's his name?

109
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,986
You know I never discuss examples
when there are three people in the room.

110
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,791
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,625
You mean, you don't even trust
your own secretary?

112
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,992
I don't even trust you, Johnny.

113
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,204
You're becoming quite the dandy,
aren't you?

114
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,773
Wearing two guns instead of one.

115
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,473
And gloves.

116
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,543
I never saw you wear gloves before.

117
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,508
Tell me, do you eat in them?

118
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,907
Got a rash on the back of my hand.

119
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,546
Doctor gave me some salve
and told me to keep them covered up.

120
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,557
Couldn't be the rash is permanent, could it?

121
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,490
What are you trying to say, McNeil?

122
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,421
Nothing.

123
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,455
I just wondered if you'd changed
in any other ways, too.

124
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,301
Tell me, you still a fast draw?

125
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,833
Faster, if anything.

126
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,467
Show me.

127
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,872
Let me see you draw.

128
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,814
Draw, Johnny.

129
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,896
You were always a right-handed gun.

130
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,597
What happened?

131
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,498
This is the hardest fist in Texas.
This is solid steel.

132
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,076
Somebody blew the old one off,
and I've shot left-handed ever since.

133
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,508
I use the right to slug guys
who ask too many questions.

134
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,718
Got any objections from you?

135
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,484
No, none at all.

136
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,391
I like skill like that.

137
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,062
But I wouldn't spread it around,
if I were you.

138
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,167
Some people might take advantage
of a cripple.

139
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,778
If I've got any letters to write,
do you mind if I borrow your secretary?

140
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,743
I keep her occupied 24 hours a day.

141
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,823
Make sure he pays you overtime, ma'am.

142
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,760
Don't pay any attention to what he says.

143
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,935
He does what I tell him to do.

144
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,697
He seems so strange.

145
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,076
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like him before.

146
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,605
That's because you've never seen death
walking in the shape of a man before.

147
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,848
That's right.

148
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,942
Death, it's in his blood.

149
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,303
Are you still in bed?

150
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,734
Sure.

151
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,570
Can you think of a nicer place to be?

152
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,015
Come on, Johnny. Sit down.

153
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:43,352
If somebody ever opened up your head
to see what was inside...

154
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,591
he'd find only one thing.

155
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,984
Why don't you get dressed?

156
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,597
- Did you see him?
- I saw him.

157
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:59,059
We may stick around this town a long time.
McNeil's got something pretty good going.

158
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,930
I may go into business with him.

159
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,704
What kind of business?

160
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,402
I don't know yet.

161
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,281
My retainer.

162
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,622
It's not that kind of business again, is it?

163
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,954
- What else?
- Not again.

164
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,261
Your big days are all over.

165
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,126
One man with a gun
just can't make it anymore.

166
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,565
We're in Texas now.
They've got the state police, the Rangers.

167
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,802
You just can't walk into a town
and walk out of it the way you used to.

168
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,832
Please.

169
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,340
Let's get out of here, out of this town.
Let's go away.

170
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,641
Shut up and get back into bed.

171
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,875
Please. You've got to talk to me
once in a while.

172
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,013
If you'd only let me help.

173
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,052
If you'd only listen.

174
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,451
If you'd only let me belong.

175
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,498
You're where you belong right now.

176
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,636
Look. I'm digging in the well,
and this comes from the walls.

177
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,601
Feel it.

178
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,572
- It's oil.
- The ground is filled with oil.

179
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,235
It makes us rich. All of us.

180
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,107
Now I know why Mr. McNeil comes to town.

181
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,841
He don't want our land. He want our oil.

182
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,111
It comes close to the top of the ground.

183
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,778
I catch a bucketful
every four or five minutes.

184
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,688
We have to tell everybody about it.
We must stop Mr. Brady before he sells out.

185
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,657
We have to stop everybody.

186
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,991
I go to Mr. Holmes.
Better you go to Mr. Brady and Mr. Johnson.

187
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,526
- How rich can you be from oil?
- As rich as gold.

188
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,760
Papa!

189
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,434
- Somebody's coming, Papa.
- Who is coming?

190
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,177
The man who came to town yesterday.
The Mr. McNeil.

191
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,848
The one Mr. Holmes told us about.

192
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,050
If he comes here,
he comes to see me, not you.

193
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,884
So you two go home.

194
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,322
It is better we should be together, <i>amigo.</i>

195
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,361
This man carries two guns.

196
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,796
Then we have two reasons
for you to go home, not one.

197
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,967
Go.

198
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,035
But what are friends for?

199
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,476
It's too late.

200
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,178
It's better we go into the shed.

201
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,516
Pepe, come in.

202
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,886
Come.

203
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,924
Inside.

204
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,393
And I stand at the side of my friend.

205
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,463
A man will talk more when he's alone
with another man, than when he's with two.

206
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,838
We need to learn from this man.

207
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,937
You are a good friend.

208
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,207
Stay in the shed and listen.

209
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,964
Your name Hansen?

210
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,296
<i>Ja.</i>

211
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,805
Sven Hansen.

212
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,268
You read English, don't you?

213
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,001
Maybe better than you read Swedish.

214
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,213
Good.

215
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,015
Read this.

216
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,047
Then sign it.

217
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,514
I don't know you.

218
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,624
I don't want your paper.

219
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,725
I guess that means
you and I are gonna have a little trouble.

220
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,060
Because if you don't sign that paper,
I'm going to have to kill you.

221
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,729
Get off my land.

222
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,826
What are you doing with that?

223
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,624
I don't know.

224
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,462
Is it true, what Pepe says
about <i>senor</i> Hansen?

225
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,438
It is true.

226
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,503
We stay out of this thing.

227
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,413
Stay out of it, Rosa?

228
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,317
How can we?

229
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,682
He was our friend.

230
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,313
No.

231
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,090
One cannot stay out of things
when a friend has been killed.

232
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,832
We must tell what we saw.

233
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,626
Tell what we saw?

234
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,766
<i>Senor</i> Brady's house
has been burned down.

235
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,738
<i>Senor</i> Hansen is killed.

236
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,108
What happens next, we do not know.

237
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,574
But this I do know.

238
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,478
Your friend is dead and cannot be helped.

239
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,181
This child that comes is alive
and can be helped.

240
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,354
You will say nothing
about what you have seen.

241
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,224
You will tell no one.

242
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,966
This child will be born in peace.

243
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,075
In peace, <i>amarme.</i>

244
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,794
Here we are, partner.
Coming into Prairie City.

245
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,902
Just another name
for God's own free country.

246
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,189
Honey...

247
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:16,519
What fun do you get out of just
sitting around here all day playing cards?

248
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,028
Gives me something to think about.

249
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,867
You're losing your nerve.

250
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,461
I can tell.

251
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,527
Something's eating at you.

252
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,106
You're crazy.

253
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,234
You've already done the job you came to do.

254
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,278
It isn't safe to stay around here like this.

255
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,939
I want you to get out of this state.

256
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,144
Deal.

257
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,366
What'll it be, mister?

258
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,773
They tell me I can get a wagon here,
with a horse.

259
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,637
How long will you be holding it?

260
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,004
How long?

261
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,406
I don't know.
I'm just going out to the Hansen farm.

262
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,380
- The Hansen farm?
<i>- Ja.</i>

263
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,645
What would you be doing out there?

264
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,448
I'm going to see my father, Sven Hansen.

265
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,489
Your father?

266
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,718
I think maybe you better
go see the sheriff, mister.

267
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,255
The sheriff?

268
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,958
Sheriff Stoner, across the street.

269
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,425
Why?

270
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,634
I don't know.
Just think you'd better, that's all.

271
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,535
Is he in trouble?

272
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,175
He's dead.

273
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,609
Buy you a drink.

274
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,216
No.

275
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,393
Did you know him?

276
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,461
Not very well.

277
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,042
Not very long.

278
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,874
But you did know him.

279
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,081
Yeah.

280
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,242
How did he die?

281
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,916
Come on. Sit down and I'll tell you about it.

282
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,364
This is Molly. My name's Johnny Crale.

283
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,034
My name is George Hansen, Mrs. Crale.

284
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,404
Sit down.

285
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,650
I would like to know. How did he die?

286
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,447
Somebody shot him.

287
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,358
Why would anyone shoot a man
like my father?

288
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,822
Maybe he had a disagreement with them.

289
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,632
Maybe your father had something
the other man wanted.

290
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,035
When did this happen?

291
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,533
Let me see. Tuesday... Three days ago.

292
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,238
Nobody seems to know how it happened.

293
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,208
They just found him shot in the head.

294
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,753
The sheriff had an inquest,
but no witnesses.

295
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:10,016
What is this for a country,
where a man is killed...

296
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,396
and nobody knows anything,
nobody does anything?

297
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:17,895
It's the kind of country it is. Things like that
happen around here all the time.

298
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,664
Isn't that true, Molly?

299
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,534
Sure. All the time.

300
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,511
Did they bury him?
Did anybody bother to give him a funeral?

301
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,009
That's one thing
you can always be sure of here.

302
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,649
I've not seen him...

303
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,759
since <i>19</i> years ago.

304
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,398
We were buying the farm together.

305
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,833
After every voyage,
I would send him a few dollars.

306
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,738
All these years, I'd dream...

307
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,613
of leaving the sea and having a home.

308
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,643
Now...

309
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,087
I don't know.

310
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,452
Thank you, sir, very much.

311
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,753
Good-bye, ma'am.

312
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,895
Where are you going?

313
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,931
I must see the sheriff.

314
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,970
That's a very good idea.

315
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,039
I'd lodge a strong complaint, if I were you.

316
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,973
You can leave it there. It'll be safe.

317
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,779
Thank you.

318
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,031
Now aren't you glad we stayed around?

319
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,039
That's more business.

320
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,440
He doesn't look too easy to me.

321
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,137
Nothing looks easy to you.

322
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,914
You know why?

323
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,710
It's because you're so easy.

324
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,551
Deal.

325
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,323
Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

326
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,396
My name is George Hansen.

327
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,724
I'm the son of Sven Hansen.

328
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,133
Come on, Willie.

329
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,397
You better get back in there.

330
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,448
Willie's here most of the time.

331
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,625
- Has someone told you about your father?
- Yes.

332
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,561
I didn't know Hansen had any relatives.

333
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,893
- Who killed him?
- We don't know.

334
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:38,966
There weren't any witnesses.
He was just found lying in the yard, dead.

335
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:42,139
Isn't it your job to find out who killed him?

336
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,739
- Yes, of course.
- Then find out.

337
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,003
Just a minute.

338
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,874
We had an inquest
and there weren't any witnesses.

339
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,949
If the killer is still in these parts,
we'll find him.

340
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,578
If not, he's probably left the state
and there's nothing I can do about it.

341
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,861
How far is it to my father's place?

342
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,296
Are you...

343
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,894
figuring on going out there?

344
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,834
Of course. It belongs to me now.

345
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,837
I wouldn't be too sure about that,
if I were you, young fella.

346
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:21,378
The law here may be different
than where you come from.

347
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,278
I have a letter from my father.

348
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,812
It says here that...

349
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,389
It says the place is mine.

350
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:31,718
It says the place is mine.

351
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,584
It's in Swedish.

352
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,818
<i>Ja.</i>

353
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,261
I don't think a letter like that'll
hold up in a court of law.

354
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,561
It also says there is a will.

355
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,432
A will filed in the court of records,
in the city of Austin.

356
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,805
It says the place belongs to me.

357
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,140
The land didn't belong to him,
so it can't belong to you.

358
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,610
I know how you feel.

359
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,910
You're a stranger here.
I don't want you to get into any trouble.

360
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,211
Trouble?

361
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,721
How can I get in trouble
claiming what is mine?

362
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,686
You're afraid I will be killed.

363
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,157
If I'm killed, you'll have to find out
who did it. That is your job.

364
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:13,057
Listen. No foreigner's gonna
come in here and tell me how to run my job.

365
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,654
You understand that?

366
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,026
<i>Ja.</i>

367
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,036
I understand.

368
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,538
Where you staying? The hotel?

369
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,578
No.

370
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,472
I am staying in my own room.

371
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,513
In my own house, on my own land.

372
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,252
And nobody better try to move me.

373
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,016
I'm mighty sorry to have to tell you this...

374
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,953
but that land is under
a No Trespass order from the court.

375
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,360
You put one foot on that property
and I'll have to put you in jail.

376
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,331
The law says this, too?

377
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,934
That's right.

378
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,333
If the law made a mistake,
you have the right to hire an attorney.

379
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,941
He'll see to it that you get justice.

380
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,877
You're not in some foreign country now,
where a man has no rights at all.

381
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,176
You've got to understand that.

382
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,777
You've got a right to justice.

383
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,613
And you'll get it.

384
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,888
I think I do begin to understand.

385
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,357
All right, I will stay in the hotel.

386
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,358
But I understand justice, too.

387
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,696
I think I will get it.

388
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,377
So, I suppose this will
is registered in Austin.

389
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,953
The Swede's staying here in the hotel.

390
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,021
Looks to me like
he's just thickheaded enough...

391
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,220
to want to start some trouble.

392
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,623
Have you had legal training, Sheriff?

393
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,895
- No, sir.
- Then don't give me legal advice.

394
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,071
What are you sweating like that for?

395
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,572
Somebody frightened you?

396
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,699
No, sir, Mr. McNeil...

397
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,802
but you've got to understand
my position in this matter.

398
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,074
It's a very touchy situation.

399
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,948
I could get caught in the middle.

400
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,546
I can't afford that.

401
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:20,021
And I can't afford you
unless you stop this public shivering.

402
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,319
Now get out of here. I'm busy.

403
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,258
Swedes in this country.

404
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,735
They keep popping up like jackrabbits.

405
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,534
This one's younger, McNeil, and smarter.

406
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,137
I want to see him.

407
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,905
Sure.

408
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,467
Come in.

409
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,609
McNeil wants to see you.

410
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,735
Why?

411
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,137
Business.

412
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,210
You work for him?

413
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,980
In a way.

414
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:33,591
Then you knew about my father's land
when you talked to me?

415
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,166
I'm afraid I did.

416
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,452
Mr. Hansen.

417
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,221
My name is Ed McNeil.

418
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,655
This is my secretary, Mona Stacey.

419
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:05,251
I want to tell you how personally saddened
I was by your father's death.

420
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,694
Sit down, won't you?

421
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,631
I posted a $500 reward
for any information leading to an arrest.

422
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,630
I do not think
you will have to pay that reward.

423
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,835
I do not think there's going to be any arrest.

424
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,843
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing. Thank you.

425
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:26,447
Crale tells me that you've been asking
about your father's farm.

426
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,816
I presume you naturally thought
you had an interest in the place.

427
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,752
That's why you came here, isn't it?

428
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,416
Do I have to give you reasons for what I do?

429
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,152
No, of course not.

430
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,693
But you did think you were going to
inherit the place? Am I correct?

431
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,526
I have inherited it.

432
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,403
Let's get the facts straight.

433
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:49,996
I hold prior right, by land grant,
to all of this property.

434
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:54,771
About 20 years ago, when this country
was first settled, the squatters moved in.

435
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,110
Some of them failed,
sold their farms and went on.

436
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,445
Your father was unfortunate enough
to buy one of these...

437
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,850
which they had no right to sell.

438
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,518
I'm a man who understands...

439
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,782
the position these poor people
find themselves in.

440
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,987
So, instead of evicting them...

441
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,997
I've been paying them
to get off my property.

442
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:18,963
Wouldn't you say that's
being about as fair as a man can be?

443
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:25,406
If what you say is true,
then what you are doing is fair.

444
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:32,676
And since what I'm saying is true,
I've made out a release for you.

445
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,483
All you have to do is sign it,
and I will have $300 placed to your order.

446
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,317
I have $300.

447
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,152
I also have a farm.

448
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,419
Have you seen that land?
It's not worth $300. It isn't worth $200.

449
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,822
Then I know I could not allow you
to pay me for it.

450
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,267
I could not accept more for a thing
than it is worth.

451
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,134
Young man, you're a foreigner.

452
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,607
You're making a fresh start in a new land.

453
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,342
Let me ask you something.
Are your papers in order?

454
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:10,516
I think if they're not in order, the proper
authorities will know about it soon enough.

455
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,381
And even if they are in order,
they will also know.

456
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,459
What gives you that idea?

457
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,421
You are going to tell them about
all this that is going on, are you not?

458
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,054
Then I withdraw my offer.

459
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,861
Don't come back saying you changed your
mind. I promise you, I won't change mine.

460
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,905
I don't think we will
have any trouble about that.

461
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,548
He looks like he's my problem now.

462
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,286
But not in the way you think.

463
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:53,660
Another killing at this moment
might prove most inopportune.

464
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,930
I want him on the train tonight.

465
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,197
I don't care how you get him there,
just so long as he stays alive.

466
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,997
I never like to do half a job
when a whole job's easier.

467
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,138
But I'm always willing
to make an exception for a partner.

468
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,184
Because, that's what I think we're gonna be.

469
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,668
Hello, boy.

470
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,734
Are you going to live here?

471
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,311
Yes, I am.

472
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,107
But not right now.

473
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,449
Tell me something. Did you know the man
who used to live here?

474
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,950
He was my friend.

475
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,750
- You are neighbors.
- My house is over there.

476
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,950
Beside the railroad track.

477
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,353
Are you the man
who makes everybody move away?

478
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,787
No.

479
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,393
But you say you are going to live here.

480
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,667
You must be the man
who makes everybody move away.

481
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,772
No, you are all mixed up.

482
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,577
You see, the man who used to live here...

483
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,846
the man who was killed, he was my father.

484
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,053
<i>Senor</i> Hansen? Your papa?

485
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,786
Yes. I am George Hansen.

486
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,123
- My name is Pepe Mirada.
- I am very glad to know you, Pepe.

487
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,656
We have this cow, <i>senor.</i>

488
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:40,703
The cow of your father.
When the trouble came, we took this cow.

489
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:44,397
Not to steal, of course. To take care.
This is good, no?

490
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,305
That is good.

491
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,484
Of course, now you come back...

492
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,211
we give the cow back.

493
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:02,017
Maybe later,
but do you have a cow of your own?

494
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,321
No, <i>senor.</i> But we have this goat.
A very fine goat.

495
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,524
You just keep that cow.
Especially if she's giving milk.

496
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,537
Lots of milk, <i>senor.</i>
Why don't you come visit us?

497
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,969
I would like to.

498
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,971
Right now?

499
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,742
Right now.

500
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,203
I'll show you.

501
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,681
My father spent 30 years at sea.
Most of them on whale ships.

502
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,419
He must have kept this as a souvenir.

503
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,460
If a man knows how to throw one of these,
he can do a lot of damage.

504
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:42,862
Could it kill a man?

505
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,372
We heard the shot
and when Pepe and I got there...

506
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:53,341
it was stuck in the ground,
as though he had tried to throw it.

507
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:57,505
That is all we know.
I brought it home to remember him by.

508
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,621
Would you care for a glass of wine?

509
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,850
Yes, I would.

510
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,696
Have you killed any whales, <i>senor</i> Hansen?

511
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,700
I have killed many whales.

512
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,671
- Show us how you do it.
- I was talking to him, Pepe.

513
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:27,574
- Girls don't know anything about whales.
- Wait a minute.

514
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:30,107
Girls know something
about almost everything.

515
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,342
Perhaps even more than you and I.
Now, you watch.

516
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:40,085
You must hold it this way. You see?
With this, you do not kill a whale.

517
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,990
This is just to hook onto him.
Then you kill him with a lance.

518
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,700
- Four of them, Papa.
- <i>Con permiso.</i> Excuse me.

519
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,481
Is your name Jose Mirada?

520
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,777
Yes.

521
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,456
We've got a message for you.
Can you guess what it is?

522
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,519
No, <i>senor.</i>

523
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:20,459
You're leaving town, Jose. By Sunday.

524
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,297
By Sunday?

525
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:28,095
No, <i>senor,</i> that is not possible.
You see, we have the problem of...

526
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,773
Can't you try to make it possible?

527
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,207
Try it as a favor to me, <i>amigo?</i>

528
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,277
Of course I will try.

529
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,685
I do not like
to make disappointments for you.

530
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,579
But there is the question of my wife.
You see, any day now she...

531
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,090
Any day now, your wife could be a widow.

532
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:54,798
Why do you keep thinking of yourself?
Why don't you try to do something for me?

533
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,866
What are you doing here?

534
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:05,340
- Visiting a friend. What are you doing?
- I'm trying to help a friend.

535
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,638
Sunday, Jose.

536
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,736
Remember.

537
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,913
But my wife is going to have a baby
any day now.

538
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,046
- Maybe even today.
- Congratulations.

539
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:20,890
Sunday.

540
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,500
I know what he said.

541
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,164
- You have come to see us on a sad day.
- I am sorry.

542
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,343
- How long have you lived here?
- Lived here?

543
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,079
My people have always lived here.

544
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,912
How many hundreds of years...

545
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,110
A long time.

546
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:57,020
Can you tell me, Mr. Mirada,
why is it that McNeil wants all this land?

547
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,792
No, <i>senor.</i>

548
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,188
If we only knew that...

549
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,165
we might have the answer
to our own problem.

550
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,895
I have looked at my father's place.
I have seen your land.

551
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,367
A man can raise a crop here,
but he would never get rich.

552
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,836
And yet, one man wants it all. Why?

553
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,111
This is a mystery, <i>amigo.</i> I know nothing.

554
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,644
- And the other ranchers?
- Nobody knows nothing.

555
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,887
Somebody, somewhere, must know why.

556
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,819
I am going to find that man.

557
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,673
- Mr. Holmes?
- That's right.

558
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:57,445
My name is George Hansen.
I think you knew my father.

559
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,682
I knew your father. He was a fine man.

560
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,926
Thank you. I've been talking to people
here and there...

561
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,122
about what happened to him.

562
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,029
About what's happening to us all,
and it seems...

563
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:14,901
that you are the man who is trying
to hold these people together.

564
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:15,139
Trying. But that's all. It can't be done.

565
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,370
Trying. But that's all. It can't be done.

566
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:23,811
People are just like any other kind of animal.
When they get scared, they scatter.

567
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,675
Including myself.

568
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,582
Excuse me, I'm busy.

569
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,830
Don't you understand?

570
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:47,370
If only the men would stick together,
then maybe we would have a chance.

571
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,836
A chance at what?

572
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,931
The trouble with the people around here
is all they do is talk.

573
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,805
I've had enough talk.

574
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,041
I'd a sight rather fight all alone
than count on other people helping me.

575
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:01,447
- By then it will be too late.
- I'll take my chances.

576
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,318
You feel the same way, Mr. Johnson?

577
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,983
It's like I say,
it's not as much up to me as my wife.

578
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,620
I can't just think of myself.

579
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,314
- I will have whiskey.
- Yes, sir.

580
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,696
- Ma'am, would you have a drink with me?
- I'll be glad to.

581
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,965
I didn't know you were still here.

582
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,773
Yes. I am still here.
Is there some reason I should not be?

583
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,947
I guess not. It's a funny town, that's all.

584
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,718
People disappear or get shot
or get run out, almost every day.

585
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:16,826
Let's drink to both of us getting out of here,
just as quick as the good Lord will let us.

586
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,055
I would rather drink to you.

587
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,624
Because I am not
getting out of this town. Not ever.

588
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,704
You do not like it here, do you?

589
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,241
I hate it.

590
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,912
Then why don't you get out?

591
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,209
You know why as well as I do.

592
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,482
Go ahead. Have another one.

593
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:49,953
All right, I will.

594
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,361
Tell me a thing.
What kind of work does he do?

595
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,832
Why is it that every time
a man gives a girl two fast drinks...

596
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,964
he thinks she'll tell him
everything she knows?

597
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,673
I am sorry.

598
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,774
I guess that is what I was hoping for.

599
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:13,578
Pour. I could do this all afternoon and
never even give you the time of day.

600
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,085
Maybe. But not if we were drinking aquavit.

601
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:25,094
We're not drinking whatever it is,
we're drinking whiskey.

602
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:29,890
No matter how much I drink,
I'll tell you only one thing.

603
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,301
Stay away from him.

604
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,365
Why?

605
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:37,270
He's mean.

606
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,540
He killed my father, didn't he?

607
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,116
Naughty, naughty. Try again.

608
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,014
Why do you stay with a man like this?

609
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,854
I stay with him because I'm what I am.

610
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,662
I stay with him
because no other man would have me.

611
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,399
I stay with him because as low as I am,
I can turn around and see him...

612
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,998
and remember there's somebody lower.

613
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,143
Look at me.

614
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,854
Can't you see what's written here?

615
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:32,486
Can't you see a thousand days and nights
that never were love...

616
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,759
and never could be...

617
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,426
and never can be?

618
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,831
Molly...

619
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,607
You listen to me.
I have been all over the world.

620
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,973
I have known all kinds of men,
all kinds of women.

621
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,544
But I never knew one who could not change,
if he wanted to.

622
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,711
That's big talk.

623
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,585
- I am telling you the truth.
- The truth about what?

624
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,258
I just said "the truth."

625
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:09,626
That is not so difficult to understand.

626
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,634
You're standing in my place.

627
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,845
Nice music.

628
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,590
You like our music here?

629
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,951
I asked you a question.
Do you like our music?

630
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,194
Keeno.

631
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:47,166
What do you think of a fella
who don't like our music?

632
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,172
The way I got it figured,
a fella shouldn't have to stay anywhere...

633
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,141
where he don't like the music.
Right, Keeno?

634
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,678
A fella shouldn't stay anywhere
where he don't like the music.

635
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,031
How do you like this for service?
Got your stuff all set to put on the train.

636
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,606
Even got you a ticket right out of the state.

637
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,766
You better take it back to my room.

638
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:29,368
You ain't got no room no more.
Ain't that right, Johnny?

639
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,680
That's right.

640
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,507
You know what I better do?
I better count the towels.

641
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,382
See how many he's trying to get off with.

642
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,758
Where'd you get that, Swede?

643
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,304
No towels yet. What've we got here?

644
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,382
Look what he's got.

645
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:22,831
Molly, try this on.
If you like it, I might buy it for you.

646
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,667
- Why don't you make them stop it?
- Sure.

647
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:30,505
- Put it back.
- How much you take for it?

648
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,199
Just put it back.

649
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,740
I don't see anything so special about this.

650
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,781
Looks just like any
old piece of merchandise to me.

651
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,147
If it was mine, I'd be glad to sell.
Right, boys?

652
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,447
- Sure would.
- I'd give it away.

653
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:50,124
Come on, Swede, you can tell me,
is there something special about it?

654
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,924
It belonged to my mother.
One day, it will belong to my wife.

655
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:59,531
In that case, we might as well
just split it up between them right here.

656
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,103
Half and half.

657
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:35,134
- You got to stop them or they'll kill him.
- Sure.

658
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:39,938
When you're through with him,
put him on the train.

659
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,028
What did they do to you?

660
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,232
The hotel, last night...

661
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:18,034
- A fight?
- Yeah.

662
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:21,109
Then why do you come from that way?

663
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,442
They put me on a train.

664
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,452
First time it slowed down, I roll off.

665
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,719
Let me fix you up.

666
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,640
You stay here with us, <i>amigo.</i>
Things will clear up soon.

667
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,079
- No. I shall get back into town.
- You going to fight some more?

668
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,578
No, Pepe. I'm not exactly anxious
to fight some more.

669
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,890
But also, I'm not anxious to lose my farm.

670
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,424
This farm is not possible to be saved.

671
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,702
Pretty soon, we lose them. All of us.

672
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:23,530
You know something, Mirada?

673
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,405
There is only one reason
why we must lose our farms.

674
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,374
There is only one reason
why my father was killed.

675
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,415
- Do you know what that reason is?
- No, <i>senor.</i>

676
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,642
It is because of fear.
It is because people are afraid.

677
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:42,352
We could turn this valley inside out
if only people were not afraid.

678
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,859
Which fear do you speak of, <i>senor?</i>

679
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,889
- Being afraid to talk.
- To talk about what, <i>senor</i> Hansen?

680
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,732
Mrs. Mirada...

681
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,972
I cannot help thinking that somebody knows
why my father was killed...

682
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:00,702
and will not tell.

683
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:06,081
I also think that they know who killed him,
and also will not tell that.

684
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,713
<i>Senor</i> Hansen, you have been our friend.

685
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:13,984
Your papa was also our friend.

686
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,752
But we have been bad friends.

687
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:24,233
This is my fault,
so I will tell it to you myself.

688
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,897
Jose, he wished to say it all the time.

689
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,864
There is oil in this place.

690
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,043
Oil?

691
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:39,547
It leaks down the side of my new well.
I tell this thing to your papa.

692
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,753
Then, the one with the black gloves
rides up and shoots him.

693
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,423
All your papa has is the harpoon.

694
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,894
We see this, Pepe and I.

695
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,858
- We see it and are afraid to tell.
- I was afraid.

696
00:58:56,566 --> 00:59:00,127
I was afraid for the baby.
So, we have spoilt our honor for this fear.

697
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:04,070
That doesn't matter.
What matters is that you do tell now.

698
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,542
I think something...

699
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,670
I think that when the people
know there is oil in the valley...

700
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,543
then they will fight.

701
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:28,392
Can I be of any help?

702
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,361
Then I must be getting back.

703
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,240
Is it all right if I tell the sheriff
this other thing?

704
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,935
About my father?

705
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:50,307
You tell them
Jose Mirada is no longer afraid.

706
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,048
I will.

707
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,600
Papa, why can't I help, too?

708
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,334
No, Pepe.

709
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,367
This moment, your mama does not love us.

710
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,479
She loves only the baby.

711
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,594
Sure you can get the preacher
to open the church?

712
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,291
He will. Leave it to me.

713
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:42,132
I'm the deacon. I can call a meeting
to tell the town it's floating on oil.

714
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,570
- How soon?
- We ought to have them ready by 8:00.

715
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,700
I'll have them ring the bell
as soon as I can get a man there.

716
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,404
I'll go and call Barnaby and Johnson.

717
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:54,745
If Mirada's gonna identify the killer,
maybe he shouldn't ride into town alone.

718
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:58,753
After I finish with the others, I'll stop by
and take him with me. Anything else?

719
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:03,155
Can't think of anything. I'll be out of here
in five minutes. Good luck.

720
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:04,885
Martha.

721
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,278
The little baby, she is born yet,
<i>amigo</i> Mirada?

722
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,253
The little brown baby?

723
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,093
That is to say...

724
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:44,430
it is about to be. The pains are coming.

725
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:48,593
My daughter, she is taking care of it.
Maybe any minute now, <i>senor.</i>

726
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:55,476
I wish the little one
has eyes as sharp as his father.

727
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,515
I do not think I understand, <i>senor.</i>

728
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:06,411
Sometimes, this early in the morning,
English gives me much trouble.

729
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:10,518
Not as much trouble
as you're planning to give me.

730
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,454
Trouble?

731
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,630
You're going to be a witness
against me, aren't you?

732
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:19,033
What's the matter? Can't you talk?

733
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:29,375
You just told Mr. Hansen you will talk,
and all of a sudden you can't talk.

734
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,508
Or can you?

735
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:45,952
Would you be so good as to listen
one moment...

736
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,220
what I want to say?

737
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,265
What do you want to say?

738
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:53,668
Speak up.

739
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,331
Don't be afraid.

740
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,569
Please...

741
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,301
do not kill me.

742
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,678
Whatever gave you such an idea?

743
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:14,623
Was it because you think
you saw me kill somebody else?

744
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,890
Get down. Get down on your knees.

745
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:23,930
Get down on your knees
and swear by this unborn child...

746
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:27,730
that you'll never testify
against me. Get down.

747
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:30,372
Down.

748
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,568
Get down, Mirada!

749
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,549
You will kill me...

750
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,947
because you must kill me.

751
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,192
If I swear...

752
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,057
you will kill me.

753
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,530
If I beg...

754
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,895
you will kill me.

755
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,770
If I stand as a man...

756
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:08,209
still you will kill me.

757
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,476
I stand as a man.

758
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,521
Papa, it's come.

759
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,800
Good morning. I'm very glad to see you.

760
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:43,805
Pardon me a moment,
I'm just paying these gentlemen off.

761
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:47,569
It appears that we've come upon new times
in Prairie City.

762
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,239
- Violence is passe.
- You hope.

763
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:52,807
Keeno.

764
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,209
Weed...

765
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,816
and Baxter.

766
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:01,413
To repeat our agreement, so there shan't be
any misunderstandings, it is this.

767
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,890
You are to leave Prairie City within the hour.

768
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:07,053
You're not to return
as long as I'm a resident. Am I correct?

769
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,222
- We understand that.
- Agreed.

770
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,799
Well, gentlemen.

771
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,666
Just so we should not prolong
the unhappy moment of farewell...

772
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,038
- Good-bye, gentlemen.
- Anytime, Mr. McNeil.

773
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,373
- See you, Johnny.
- Thanks a lot.

774
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:28,375
We seem to have stirred up
quite a little excitement.

775
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,746
A little.

776
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,787
Where's your secretary?

777
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:37,953
Sent her to Dallas last night.
Same train you put Hansen on.

778
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:43,622
You know, I'm somewhat disappointed
by your disposition of Hansen.

779
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,728
My passenger got to Dallas.
Why didn't yours?

780
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:51,631
Why didn't you say
that there was a witness around...

781
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,834
when you killed the old man?

782
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:01,477
That was a mistake.
And they hang men for such carelessness.

783
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,446
They won't hang me.

784
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,683
The witness is dead.

785
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:11,721
Baxter tells me that
the good citizens of this community...

786
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,125
are forgathering in the local church.

787
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:18,860
Don't you think the death of that Mexican
might somewhat inflame them against you?

788
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,162
And you?

789
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,600
I think not.

790
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,171
You know, there are two ways
to skin any cat.

791
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:30,268
The first way having failed,
I'll now put the second into effect.

792
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,113
In a short time,
they'll hail me as their savior.

793
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:36,082
I'll be the most popular man in the valley.

794
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,816
And the richest, too.

795
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,154
But not you.

796
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,618
I fear that before the morning's out...

797
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,254
we'll hear the sound of marching feet
outside this hotel.

798
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,091
They'll be marching for you.

799
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,560
Here's your money, Johnny.

800
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,736
Go on, run.

801
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,474
Run!

802
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,141
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

803
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,146
Something I saw this morning...

804
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,982
something rather remarkable.

805
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,418
Sit down.

806
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,504
I think this may interest you.

807
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:39,014
What I saw this morning
was really remarkable.

808
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,355
I saw a man who wasn't afraid to die.

809
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,032
The man on the black horse.

810
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:40,587
I saw something this morning
I've never seen before in my life.

811
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,658
You've told me that over and over again.

812
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,858
- Can I get up now?
- No.

813
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:50,427
I'm trying to tell you.
Why don't you listen to me?

814
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,693
Why don't you try to understand?

815
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,828
I saw a man who wasn't afraid to die.
Do you know what this means?

816
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,403
A man who wasn't afraid to die.

817
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,740
Did he die?

818
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,613
There's a lot of people
who aren't afraid to die.

819
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:17,217
That's not true. Every man
I ever held a gun on was sweating with fear.

820
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,918
Every single one.

821
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,054
Except this one man. Even McNeil.

822
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:25,733
Not this man.

823
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:30,694
Do you mind if I get up now?

824
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,733
Sure. Get up. Anything you want.

825
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,779
Good-bye.

826
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:07,901
See?

827
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,643
It doesn't work.

828
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,874
It just doesn't work anymore.

829
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,253
Amen.

830
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:04,191
Although we have opened with prayer,
we are not here today for religious services.

831
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:07,029
We are of many faiths, and of one hope.

832
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,836
The church edifice has been thrown open
that we may freely discuss...

833
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:14,670
a most unusual situation,
upon which our futures...

834
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,411
and the futures of our children depend.

835
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,571
And the futures of our children depend.

836
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,118
I'm sorry to interrupt...

837
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,345
but could I say something?

838
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,391
I came here because...

839
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:38,190
I don't think you know something,
and I think you ought to know it.

840
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:43,367
Mr. Mirada was killed this morning,
in front of his own house.

841
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,402
Mr. McNeil was killed in his hotel room.

842
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:56,340
The killer is still at the hotel...

843
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:59,650
and a man named George Hansen
is walking down the street...

844
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,781
with nothing but a whale harpoon
to fight with.

845
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:11,193
I didn't mean to interrupt a church service,
or anything like that.

846
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:16,061
I just thought you'd like to know.

847
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,908
I thought you might want to help.

848
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,688
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm going down that street.

849
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,198
- What about the oil?
- The oil be hanged.

850
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:15,779
You're a little too far for a fair throw.

851
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:18,782
Come a little closer.

852
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,746
Come on, Hansen.

853
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,654
All of you, come closer.

854
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,996
You wouldn't want
to disappoint your friends.

855
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:32,096
They all came here to see blood.

856
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:36,835
Why don't you bring them in a little closer?
Close, so they can see it.

857
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:38,504
Please, Hansen.

858
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,174
Five steps.

859
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,407
Just five steps.

860
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,642
Two steps. Two.

861
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:50,907
One.

862
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:53,085
Just one step.

863
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:57,284
Just close enough so you can get
a fair chance with that meat hook.

864
01:19:58,593 --> 01:19:59,992
How about it?
