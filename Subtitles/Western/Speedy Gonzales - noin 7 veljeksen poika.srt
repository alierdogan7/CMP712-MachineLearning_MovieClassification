1
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,620
Speedy Gonzales
- The son of the approximately
seven brothers

2
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,970
a bottle of whiskey and a coke for the kid.

3
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Another ones, water suffices.

4
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I can't believe I missed you.
- Maybe you just can't shoot?

5
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,350
Or maybe I dodged?

6
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Speedy Gonzales?
- Yeah.

7
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,380
I pay for the bottles.
- No, they're free.

8
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,990
On the contrary: do you want
some more? On the house.

9
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,630
How about the tip?
- Of course.

10
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,250
By the way, why did you shot at me?
- Wrong guy.

11
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,350
Yes?

12
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,370
Right! Pour me a beer, sonny.

13
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,170
You're just passing by I suppose?

14
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,030
I'm afraid that you have gone
too far away from home now -

15
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,480
- and you might never find your
way back unless you leave soon.

16
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,770
Okay, okay. This New York
is still a small town

17
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,500
but I can assure you it will get bigger

18
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,040
and I can't protect all the passerbys

19
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,340
- unless they pass by very quickly
like you surely will? Right?

20
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,000
How about it?
I didn't hear your answer.

21
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,570
Ok, sheriff. Who killed my brother?

22
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,790
Who?

23
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,590
Moses Gonzales. Someone here
shot him in the back. Who was it?

24
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,220
Well...

25
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,370
The investigation is still going on...
- Yes, and I'll continue it.

26
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:55,557
What's up, Clyde?

27
00:10:56,785 --> 00:11:00,679
You recognised me again?

28
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,177
It was nothing. Bye.
- Bye then.

29
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,682
Goddamn boys! The End of the world must
be near as the horses are shrinking.

30
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,274
Maybe it ate something bad.

31
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:29,823
Or maybe it has too small hide.

32
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,493
Let's unbutton it so it can grow more.

33
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,766
Maybe it's a kangaroo since it has
bags under the eyes.

34
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:46,146
Yes, and there's bags on the knees too.
It must be a kangaroo.

35
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,633
Those are good at jumping, I tell you.

36
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:54,538
Here's the stick. Try to jump over it!
Go on! Go on!

37
00:11:55,044 --> 00:12:00,576
I think that the owner of this kangaroo
is reaching to see over the saloon door.

38
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,186
He must be leaving town soon.

39
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:09,523
Hey, animal. Do you eat some hay? I'll give
you some. - No, don't give so long canes.

40
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:16,675
Such a small animal can't eat so long canes. We have
to cut 'em shorter. Here you go. Eat some short hay.

41
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:28,615
If you're the owner of this draisine I'll
tell you it's ready to go.  -Thanks.

42
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:33,049
We haven't introduced ourselves yet.
I'm Speedy Gonzales.

43
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,617
Goddammit!

44
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:47,612
Yes, gentlemen. He's called Pony.
And you're? - Rud...

45
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:51,695
No, no. To him. Shake hands!

46
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,859
Jesse.

47
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,527
Rudolf!

48
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,558
Tell me something!
- About what?

49
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:30,067
About Moses.
- Ask her!

50
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:00,014
Tell me something about Moses!

51
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:03,663
For a moment I thought he's back from dead.
- He's my brother.

52
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:10,609
Did you know him well.
- Quite well. I was his wife.

53
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:41,521
Hello, "Slowest of the West".
- Hello, Bat Masterson.

54
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,164
Give me one more.
- Pay first the previous drinks!

55
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:05,359
Couldn't I have just one more.
I'm thinking of going to bank tomorrow.

56
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:16,182
Whisky.

57
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,298
How many?
- a couple.

58
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,756
Two normal sizes. Crude planks.
- Yeah.

59
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:27,008
Shot dead... it makes 30$.

60
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:32,759
Ten of spades, jack of spades, whor...

61
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,767
Queen of spades, king of spades
and a ace of spades.

62
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:44,286
Bat, you're playing honest.
- What do you mean?

63
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:47,659
I won! I have five-of-a-kind, aces!

64
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:52,816
Damned. You're cheating nevertheless.
Two ace of spades!

65
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:57,426
I never cheat. Draw!

66
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:17,565
Fine. Who's dealing?
- You are.

67
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:54,865
That's Manolito's chair.
- I raise 2$.

68
00:17:54,866 --> 00:18:00,030
I raise 3$.
- 3$ more.

69
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:09,450
I raise 3$
- 4$ more.

70
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:16,786
Manolito will check how's your biting.
- 5$ more.

71
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,700
I still raise 5$.

72
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:30,650
5$ more!  - Actually, the drinks last
night were not on the house.

73
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:44,872
How much was it?

74
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:50,714
Nevermind. They were on the house anyway.
Do you want more?

75
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,438
I bet all in.

76
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:24,311
Do you know anything about Moses?

77
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:09,707
Everything is little messed up in this town.
I advice you to leave and forget it all.

78
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,399
You're fast. Ok. But there's too many of them
- Who do you mean?

79
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:22,307
One large teak coffin! My pa died finally!
-That's so sad, Hoss.

80
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:27,475
One large size. Teak!

81
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:44,293
Hey! Pa just died, drinks for everyone. I'll pay!

82
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:51,237
Finally I can start having some good time.
I was so pissed off herding the cows all the time.

83
00:21:52,296 --> 00:21:56,569
Hey! Where's all the girls?
- How about your kid brother, Joe?

84
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:59,179
I guess he bit the dust too.

85
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,622
Rosa! Music!

86
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,183
a couple of 2-meters long, crude plank!

87
00:23:57,622 --> 00:24:00,360
Don't let me die laughing!

88
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:03,026
Thanks!

89
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:13,482
Don't move!

90
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:20,852
You wanna know who killed
your brother? It was me.

91
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,056
I don't believe you.

92
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:28,802
You better stop digging this case
and leave this town.

93
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:33,163
Then I have to shoot you too.

94
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:37,638
Raise your little hands up!

95
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:40,143
Same goes for you, missy!

96
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:45,351
And for you! - And for you!
-And you!

97
00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:02,129
What's happening here?
- I don't know. Join the queue.

98
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:07,686
Right!

99
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:35,927
Money or your life!
- I got nothing. They just took everything!

100
00:26:36,732 --> 00:26:39,094
What? - 3 men just came
and took everything.

101
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:41,737
It's true!

102
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:48,383
I can't believe it.
- Oh, it's you, Clyde?

103
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,839
What a rotten luck!

104
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,108
You didn't recognise me?
- Not at all.

105
00:26:56,108 --> 00:27:02,429
Damned! First time you don't
recognise me and I'm too late!

106
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:12,241
Well. Come on Clyde. Let's see if
anything's left. You never know.

107
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:23,040
Oh no, no. I don't think there's even
a cent left. They made a good job.

108
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,979
They were professionals, you see.

109
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:31,974
What are they doing here in our place?
- Don't be sad, Clyde!

110
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:40,042
I give you something from my own
pocket, so it's not a futile visit.

111
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:42,543
Here you go, something for you too.

112
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:48,226
Don't put your gun away during
the robbery. Someone could see.

113
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,246
Sorry.

114
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:55,700
Right!

115
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,089
Put the money on the desk!
-Yes.

116
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:04,102
Here, here. No sudden moves!

117
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:11,834
Thank you, I'll visit you tomorrow.
- You're welcome. Bye!

118
00:29:50,151 --> 00:29:52,489
I saved your life again.

119
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:57,274
Have you ever seen a man hanged
with the guns still on his belt?

120
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:08,637
You could be the slowest of the west...
- but I'm even slower.

121
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,778
Are you picking a fight with me?

122
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:23,592
I only said that I'm the
slowest of the world.

123
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:31,289
I won...

124
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:16,839
Goddamn!

125
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:22,044
Senorita is very heated.

126
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:25,373
Can Manolito give a you
a little advice, senorita?

127
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:30,531
Senorita would be very wise if she'd take his
boyfriend with her and leave this town.

128
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:39,129
But before that Manolito and
senorita will...  - Hmm, why not?

129
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:45,217
Caramba!

130
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:49,501
There you go. Have a little bath.

131
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:56,810
Yes?

132
00:32:58,213 --> 00:32:59,886
Yes?

133
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:19,778
2 coffins, crude plank.

134
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,923
2 more!

135
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:28,354
One!

136
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:32,136
And one more!

137
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:49,624
A bottle of hooch.

138
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:16,761
We've run out of the crude planks.

139
00:34:22,235 --> 00:34:24,448
It's clean now.

140
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,146
Can I go now?

141
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,820
And what's there?

142
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:41,440
Dust... and shells.

143
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,797
And what about there?

144
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,701
Dust.

145
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:56,430
Listen Claudia...

146
00:34:56,806 --> 00:35:02,444
Can I go now? I was supposed to rob
a bank and it's almost their closing time.

147
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:07,615
Is it, really? Damn, I'm getting tired
of you playing a bank robber!

148
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,639
Be once a man and rob a train or something!

149
00:35:11,157 --> 00:35:15,977
Go on now! And if you're not improving with
your jobs I shall change to real bullets!

150
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,384
It's a quiet bunch here.

151
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,821
They're getting nervous. Believe me,
you better leave here.

152
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,985
What the hell is going on here?

153
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:47,423
There's too many of them. Can't you
just leave before it's too late?

154
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:51,328
It's already too late.

155
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:55,054
One of you boys killed my brother.

156
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:59,465
Maybe it was you. Or you.
Or you.

157
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:03,963
I'll find out eventually.
Even if I have to shoot you all.

158
00:36:04,682 --> 00:36:05,955
One by one.

159
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,192
Why can't we tell him who it was...

160
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,458
Ok, then.

161
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:25,953
You're beginning to be a quite
a nuisance, Speedy.

162
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:29,442
Of course we could deal with you differently.

163
00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:31,715
Right?

164
00:36:31,715 --> 00:36:34,471
Why do you always forget the women?

165
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:42,401
But we are gentlemen and
we don't like killing.

166
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,900
Well? How does it look?

167
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:03,030
It's a clean bottom, sonny.

168
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:04,895
What else?

169
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:08,735
It looks like someone shot you
with saltbullets to the ass.

170
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:14,377
Claudia
- What? Your wife?

171
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:20,447
Dammit. It was a real cardinal
mistake to marry Claudia.

172
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:25,471
No, no. Look, we can arrange
a divorce for you.

173
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,887
We can accuse her of mental cruelty
and the holes in your ass.

174
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:15,322
This is a robbery. Hands up
and go against the wall!

175
00:39:16,552 --> 00:39:18,397
Not today. I got things to do.

176
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,796
I said: hands up and
go against the wall!

177
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:23,932
And I said: I got things to do.
Come again some other day!

178
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:52,723
Right! The jury seems to be
ready sitting in their right place.

179
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:58,348
This trial can be started.
Bring in the defendant!

180
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:10,534
Right! Slowest of the West,
you'll be the prosecutor!

181
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,370
And what's the charge?

182
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:27,835
He shot banker to his belly because
he was too slow to turn his back.

183
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:33,204
And what the defense has to say?

184
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:47,694
The late banker was known as...
should I say: unsocial man.

185
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:52,431
He was very negative towards
poor bill forgers.

186
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,786
Besides...

187
00:41:57,018 --> 00:42:00,819
You had to be very fast
to shoot him in the belly -

188
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,436
- because he cowardly always
tried to turn his back.

189
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,044
Clyde has proved with his many former
robberies to be a proper bank robber -

190
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,882
- who didn't harm the personnel.

191
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:18,972
So if a man happens to miss
a shot with his gun -

192
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:23,484
- I don't think that's so aggravating.

193
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:31,955
I think that's very sensible.

194
00:42:31,955 --> 00:42:37,096
So, shall we hear more witnesses
or shall we let him go?

195
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:45,289
As a prosecutor I want to hear more
testimonials so we can have a laugh.

196
00:42:50,352 --> 00:42:53,798
Manolito, could you say a few words?

197
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:06,980
I think Clyde is innocent.

198
00:43:07,562 --> 00:43:13,725
Banker's death was a result of
a wrong choice of a career.

199
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:18,691
It's wrong that one man keeps
a lot of money locked up -

200
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:25,271
- while people, amigos. People are
living in poverty and misery.

201
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:31,007
Although with all those pesos
we could build a better society.

202
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,127
Or amigos, drink some good tequila!

203
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:45,755
If banker had chose to be a farmer -

204
00:43:45,977 --> 00:43:52,453
- he would be tending a little sheep
on his little farm right now, loved by all.

205
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:58,486
And he'd live today and with good luck -

206
00:43:59,912 --> 00:44:02,837
- also tomorrow.

207
00:44:09,238 --> 00:44:12,169
I think that...
- Yes, yes!

208
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:13,170
You agree with us!

209
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:19,454
Any other witnesses?

210
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:26,471
Hoss.

211
00:44:37,924 --> 00:44:41,676
I think we all know that Clyde
was banker's best friend.

212
00:44:42,134 --> 00:44:46,447
If there was no money in the bank when Clyde
was robbing it banker gave from his own purse.

213
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:48,649
That was true friendship, my friends!

214
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,457
But he went too far with it -

215
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:55,560
He couldn't stand watching
Clyde suffering from his failures.

216
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:59,489
When Clyde once again fumbled with
his gun and couldn't hit with it -

217
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,820
- banker wanted to prevent
Clyde feeling incompetent -

218
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:09,031
- and shot himself in the belly thus letting
Clyde feel some well deserved joy of killing.

219
00:45:09,275 --> 00:45:11,608
That was true friendship, boys.

220
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,670
That's right!

221
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:19,558
The court has decided that
the banker committed suicide.

222
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:27,921
Strange thing is that such a bad shooter
could hit from such a short distance.

223
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:36,367
Let's go for drinks everyone.
Clyde is free to go.

224
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:23,728
190 cm, planed teak.
And now, drinks for everyone, my treat.

225
00:47:46,652 --> 00:47:49,553
Now he'll be buried next to his brother.

226
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:52,560
Goddammit, I thought he
began to discover it all.

227
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:57,303
Amigo, it was a close call.

228
00:47:57,687 --> 00:48:01,415
I wonder who shot him.
- At least it wasn't me.

229
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:06,012
Really?
- It's true. Believe it.

230
00:48:06,348 --> 00:48:09,181
In any case, let's hope we're
finally through with this.

231
00:48:10,152 --> 00:48:16,035
Moses needed to be killed. And only one
interested will be soon six feet under.

232
00:48:16,072 --> 00:48:18,965
It's best to hold our tongue on this matter.

233
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:23,180
No one knows who killed Moses Gonzales
if someone happens to ask about it.

234
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:27,452
Amigo, you need to remind the
sheriff and the bartender too.

235
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,349
Also, no one knows who
killed Speedy gonzales.

236
00:48:31,717 --> 00:48:34,496
But we don't know who did it anyway.

237
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:43,923
Tom, bury him deep!
I don't like ghosts.

238
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:30,943
Bat, why don't you offer
me a glass of whisky.

239
00:49:32,313 --> 00:49:35,010
Well, boy. Buy your own drinks.

240
00:49:43,202 --> 00:49:47,272
Hey, don't fight, boys.

241
00:49:58,572 --> 00:50:03,340
Well, now's there a bullet hole ready.

242
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,317
I'll be the boss around here from now on.

243
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:12,958
If someone has something against
it, he's welcome to draw.

244
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:50,964
You pulled it off?
- Yep.

245
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:53,459
Whisky. I got taste of
dirt in my mouth.

246
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:10,009
I don't exactly know what has happened
and how you're here again -

247
00:52:11,182 --> 00:52:18,083
- but you better drink that
whisky and hit the road -

248
00:52:18,252 --> 00:52:21,553
- before you end up like your brother.

249
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:24,388
A bullet in the back, right?

250
00:52:52,032 --> 00:52:55,765
You might guess what I want to ask?
- I know nothing about death of Moses.

251
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:07,703
Well? - They'll kill me if
I tell you anything.

252
00:53:08,462 --> 00:53:14,616
I doesn't matter who kills you and I'm
the first one in the queue of killers.

253
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:22,200
I wasn't there myself but the others.
It happened like...

254
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:26,072
Moses Gonzales, you know me?
- Well, what's the problem?

255
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:29,852
This is a delation.
- I see.

256
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,805
The train robbery yesterday. It was
done by men from our town.

257
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:39,540
I was eating strawberries on the
railway and i saw the whole thing.

258
00:53:40,076 --> 00:53:41,479
Did you recognise anyone?

259
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,848
I clearly saw Manolito,
Masterson, Hoss and Clyde.

260
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:52,269
But not others?
- No, but maybe this is enough.

261
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,908
This information was worth of gold.
- I thought so.

262
00:53:56,698 --> 00:53:59,826
And you'll be rewarded
with some metal too.

263
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:03,889
I hope it's not nickel.

264
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,263
Right, there's our strawberry picker.

265
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,650
Amigos, who'll do it?

266
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:17,337
It's difficult to hit a moving target.

267
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:21,142
Clyde couldn't hit him anyway.
- Yes I could.

268
00:54:21,793 --> 00:54:27,489
At least if I go nearer.
- I don't believe you.

269
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:57,751
What did I say? Second one hit
already but I made it sure.

270
00:54:58,073 --> 00:55:02,044
I've always said that strawberries
are dangerous to your health.

271
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:05,072
That's so.

272
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:10,158
No one speaks nothing about this then, guys.
We're under the threat of death penalty

273
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,285
Otherwise we'll be all hanged.

274
00:55:13,528 --> 00:55:16,333
That's how it was.
Even if you shoot me.

275
00:55:58,282 --> 00:56:01,910
My feets are getting numb.
What are we waiting for?

276
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:07,127
Bomb is placed now and
they're both inside.

277
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:14,204
Yep, the vultures will have
a flying lunch soon.

278
00:57:14,204 --> 00:57:15,205
Shall I do it yet?

279
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:32,600
Follow them!

280
00:58:43,264 --> 00:58:44,599
Let's split up!

281
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,523
You go there! And others there!

282
01:00:04,516 --> 01:00:08,006
I'll go that way. And you there.

283
01:00:19,751 --> 01:00:22,842
Reaper has arrived.

284
01:01:06,011 --> 01:01:07,975
Say hello to your pa!

285
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:26,966
I've run out of bullets.
- Me too.

286
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:29,707
Stay here.

287
01:02:07,343 --> 01:02:09,168
Normal size, planed planks.

288
01:02:09,169 --> 01:02:13,370
For once I drew fast.

289
01:03:43,218 --> 01:03:48,325
Last one again. - Same here.
And now we run!

290
01:04:05,104 --> 01:04:06,626
Come on!

291
01:04:06,627 --> 01:04:10,779
I can't swim.
- Climb aboard then.

292
01:05:13,405 --> 01:05:21,470
Amigo, your last meal.
Go on and chew it!

293
01:06:54,195 --> 01:06:57,164
Fortunately we get more
men tomorrow.- Shut up!

294
01:06:57,165 --> 01:06:59,229
I just said that we...
- I said: shut up!

295
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:01,532
I just said...

296
01:07:26,859 --> 01:07:30,683
Cowards. I kill you all!

297
01:07:34,173 --> 01:07:36,529
Nothing's gonna stop me.

298
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:42,157
You won't shed ash to my hand
anymore, Speedy Gonzales.

299
01:07:42,157 --> 01:07:45,892
Come here, you coward!

300
01:08:02,933 --> 01:08:07,670
Ok, guys. Now we'll make
a plan for tomorrow.

301
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:14,781
In the morning we'll go to the shore
of Indian pond to ambush Speedy.

302
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:19,450
What are you thinking?

303
01:08:20,647 --> 01:08:25,884
I have a feeling that they'll go to the
shore of Indian pond to ambush us.

304
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:31,968
But I think that Speedy knows that we're going
to ambush him in the shore of Indian pond.

305
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:34,259
So he'll go to the mountains.

306
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:39,217
But sheriff will figure that I know they'll
ambush me in the shore of Indian pond.

307
01:08:39,218 --> 01:08:44,460
So they go to the mountains. but we'll go -

308
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:48,369
We'll go to sleep. Good night!

309
01:08:50,277 --> 01:08:53,498
Turn off the light, please.

310
01:09:08,593 --> 01:09:11,729
It's your final moments now.

311
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:15,279
You can't shoot because I have the girl.

312
01:09:19,252 --> 01:09:27,101
It's easy to shoot when
there's a hole already.

313
01:11:32,901 --> 01:11:35,391
It's your turn now, Speedy.

314
01:11:45,207 --> 01:11:47,322
Why haven't you shot me until now?

315
01:11:47,323 --> 01:11:49,450
I missed you on the first time.

316
01:11:49,451 --> 01:11:53,845
And it was fun to watch you kill a
bunch of bandits during this time.

317
01:11:53,846 --> 01:11:57,276
Only one left now.
- Who?

318
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:00,445
You.
- What do you mean?

319
01:12:00,747 --> 01:12:04,548
You shot Bill last year.
Did you know who he was?

320
01:12:07,602 --> 01:12:10,174
Your fiancee.

321
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:36,573
I had to choose between Bill
and me. And I chose Bill.

322
01:12:47,603 --> 01:12:53,036
<i>On the dark stormy night
seven bounty killers ride.</i>

323
01:12:53,037 --> 01:13:00,046
<i>They know where to find an outlaw
worth 10,000$ reward.  </i>

324
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:03,285
<i>The vultures are hunting again.</i>

325
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:09,318
<i>1428 $ for each one</i>

326
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:15,672
<i>They're crossing the ford
when one is left behind</i>

327
01:13:15,673 --> 01:13:22,698
<i>He falls from his horse
and there's six men left anymore.</i>

328
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:25,797
<i>The vultures are hunting again.</i>

329
01:13:25,798 --> 01:13:31,846
<i>1666,6 $ are waiting them now</i>

330
01:13:33,468 --> 01:13:38,759
<i>There's a streak of shadow in the forest.
Two men saw it but not the rest</i>

331
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:45,173
<i>They turn around, a twig crackles,
and both men fall dying. </i>

332
01:13:45,618 --> 01:13:48,587
<i>The Vultures are hunting again.</i>

333
01:13:48,588 --> 01:13:55,038
<i>Bounty is up to 2,500 $ now.</i>

334
01:13:56,861 --> 01:14:02,335
<i>They ride until their horses are whacked.
In the morning they arrive at the canyon</i>

335
01:14:02,336 --> 01:14:08,174
<i>A big boulder falls from the cliff
crushing two men underneath.</i>

336
01:14:08,175 --> 01:14:11,351
<i>The vultures are hunting again.</i>

337
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:17,738
<i>It's 5000 $ for both of them now.</i>

338
01:14:18,656 --> 01:14:22,957
<i>Those two keep riding on
and they stalk each other</i>

339
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:27,606
<i>The mountain path is dangerous.
Why did the other one fell down?</i>

340
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:32,210
<i>Last one arrives to the mountains
he finds a abandoned campfire.</i>

341
01:14:32,419 --> 01:14:38,012
<i>He hears a whistle or just a wind?
He looks but no-one's there.</i>

342
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:42,924
<i>He stands on the top of the crag,
can almost feel the money in his hand.</i>

343
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:50,405
<i>He draws his gun, shoots and fall.
There's no-one left to collect the reward.</i>

344
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,929
<i>The vultures are hunting again.</i>

345
01:14:54,930 --> 01:15:02,435
<i>You all know what's the
wage of the greedy men.</i>

346
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:18,357
Speedy...

347
01:15:22,106 --> 01:15:24,553
Oh, it was you.

348
01:15:38,905 --> 01:15:41,278
Wake me up again!

349
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:52,972
What the hell? Hero died.

350
01:18:56,179 --> 01:18:59,734
I thought so...

351
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,442
That was for Moses

352
01:19:19,645 --> 01:19:22,058
Yes. Who called me?

353
01:19:27,544 --> 01:19:28,254
Moses?

354
01:19:28,714 --> 01:19:29,624
Yes.

355
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,257
Rosa was hiding me in the cellar
for two months, you see.

356
01:19:32,257 --> 01:19:35,196
They tried to kill me and it was close too.

357
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:39,273
But now I got out of the cellar.
So, thank you, Speedy.

358
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:44,837
Let's go for drinks, I'll pay. Rosa!

359
01:20:07,456 --> 01:20:10,857
And there goes Speedy Gonzales.

360
01:20:10,892 --> 01:20:13,763
A man who killed Bat Masterson -

361
01:20:13,764 --> 01:20:21,409
- Hoss, Manolito, "Slowest of
the West" and sheriff.

362
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:30,258
And all this because his brother happened
to pick strawberries on the railway.

363
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:36,800
He also killed Clyde.
- Bonnie died later.
