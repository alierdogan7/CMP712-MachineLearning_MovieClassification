Look at the gallows tree. This is the

(Music is lively, triumphant) 

8 
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,991 
Is the house for sale?

The ö rt'm the owner of

- How much do you want? 
- What w rden ü you give? 

13 
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,239 
- If you ask me: 5 cents. 
- Let's agree to 1,000 gold dollars? 

14 
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,388 
- $ 500 
- But the house is worth much more. 

15 
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,231 
500. Yes or no? 

16 
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,195 
Come, let's go!

27 
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,519

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,959 
(Music sounds slowly) 

34 
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,749 
I hardly think 
that you will help me. 

35 
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,872 
(Call about) A Goldr ä! 

36 
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,677

37 
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,276 
(st ö hnt) 

38 
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,399 
- Where is my shirt? 
- I've burned. 

39 
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,397 
Why? I have only one thing. 

40 
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,310 
If they see you so, 
h ä nts it for you. 

41 
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,640 
- How do you f ü HLST you? 
- Hurt. 

42 
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,229 
No wonder. 
The ball sat ß quite deep. 

43 
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,957 
If the wound is large ß? 

44 
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,992 
Yes, but it will heal. 

45 
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,472

I hei ß e rune. 

48 
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,111 
- What's next? 
- Nothing. Only Rune. 

49 
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,356 
- Where are you from? 
- Where are you from? 

50 
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,314 
H ö r put on, always counter-questions. 

51 
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,349 
Well, then h ö ren 
lhren with questions! 

52 
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,788 
How will you pay me? 

53 
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,999 
I can pay ü berhaupt nothing. 

54 
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,113 
Do you think if I had money ä h tte, 
w rde ü I steal money? 

55 
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,756 
Do you think I treat you for free? 

56 
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,351 
However, k ö nntest you work off it. 

57 
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,755 
I k ö nnte use you. 

58 
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,111 
A servant 
of the boots and the house cleaning. 

59 
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,359 
- Can you cook? 
- No! I am not a shoeshine boy. 

60 
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,874 
All animals can learn k ö. 

61 
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,672 
Even Fl ö he. 

62 
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,835 
You'll f ü r me work 
and do everything I say. 

63 
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,033 
You can go to hell! 

64 
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,876 
Wei ß t you know what that is? 

65 
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,514 
The ball that I have gotten to you. 

66 
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,188 
A ungew ö hnliches caliber. 

67 
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,029 
This ball gt ü gen alone, 
to bring you to the gallows. 

68 
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,518 
And how long must I remain, 
quit until we are? 

69 
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,396 
As long as I ä gef llt. 
Perhaps ü f r forever. 

70 
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,479 
If I bleed you let h ä tte, 
w ä rst du tot 

71 
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,313 
F ü r forever. 

72 
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,952 
At first you will the house 
clean up from top to bottom. 

73 
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,152 
Then go to the village with a bell 
and k ü ndige my office. 

74 
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,829 
(calling): A doctor in the village! 

75 
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,917 
Up there is a doctor. 

76 
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,829 
(M ä girl laugh) 
What are we going to a doctor? 

77 
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,753 
You're a nice guy. 
Come here. 

78 
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,712 
How old are you? 

79 
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,514 
(Rune calls) 
A doctor lives on the mountain top! 

80 
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,349 
A doctor has arrived! 

81 
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,438 
Hours day and night. 
(l ä rung bell) 

82 
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,919 
Hey, wait a minute! 

83 
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,235 
- How hot ß t the doctor? 
- Frail. 

84 
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,392 
- Joe Frail? 
- Yes. 

85 
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,031 
Gr ü ß him sch ö n Tom Flaunce. 

86 
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,992 
- Yes. 
- Thank you. 

87 
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,552 
(laughs go ä ssig) 

88 
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,034 
A doctor has arrived! 
A doctor is in the village! (L ä GIocke rung) 

89 
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,356 
A doctor is in the village! 

90 
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,070 
- How hot ß t he? 
- Dr. Frail. He lives on the mountain. 

91 
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,798 
(ominous music) 

92 
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,276 
Let me see your teeth Z ä. 

93 
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,548 
Ill she is not. 
But it has deficiencies. 

94 
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,916 
What is it, Doctor? 

95 
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,635 
A sign of 
inadequate ä Ern hrung. 

96 
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,118 
I have been on the river no ü Gl ck. 
We ü m ssen very save. 

97 
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,392 
I have a cow, 
the k ö you can have. 

98 
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,909 
Then enter 
the little milk. 

99 
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,755 
I can not afford a cow. 

100 
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,436 
I lend it to you. 

101 
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,073 
Yes, but ... 

102 
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,033 
Thank you very much. 

103 
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,909 
What do we owe you, Doctor? 

104 
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,916 
Give me a kiss. 

105 
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,749 
- We are quits 
- (M ä girl) We're even 

106 
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,996 
So you see, 
that was not so bad. 

107 
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,278 
Who is that N ä chste? 

108 
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,110 
H ö to rt, my ü the Br! 

109 
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,318 
Your patient dies, if you do 
the cow doctor surrenders. 

110 
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,069 
The devil lives in this house! 

111 
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,031 
If you are sick, 
come to me! 

112 
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,834 
I will tell you my hands hang H ä 

113 
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,112 
H ä and my hands will heal you. 

114 
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,634 
Avoid this house! Fall is not his 
Teufelsk ü nsten a victim! 

115 
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,393 
Day Crubb. 

116 
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,475 
Do not judge 
sen b ö your eyes on me, Joe Frail. 

117 
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,992 
Br ü which, I warn you! 
The Bible says ... 

118 
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,111 
This is his Bible! 

119 
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,952 
Joe Frail, h te ü you. 
Anyone who digs the grave of another, 

120 
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,160 
will be self directed. 

121 
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,190 
So who is the N ä chste? 

122 
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,793 
I, Doctor. Do you know me? 
I was last year already with you. 

123 
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,472 
Frenchy. Are you sick 
or you need money? 

124 
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,319 
No, I have a carbuncle. 

125 
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,717 
This costs 
an ounce of gold dust, or $ 20 

126 
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,310 
- Have you money? 
- This is just enough. 

127 
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,953 
Come clean. 

128 
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,070 
- You now have a helper? 
- Quite right. 

129 
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,748 
Pull your pants down once already. 

130 
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,475 
This is Frenchy Plante. 
He ü l gt, when he opens his mouth. 

131 
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,638 
The m ö I do not chte 
encounter in the dark. 

132 
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,833 
- The doctor is a very cautious. 
- I ß wei. 

133 
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,272 
- If only I nnte schie en k ö ß like him. 
- Shut your views about ü the flame. 

134 
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,313 
The m ü sstest you 
times schie ß s see, boy. 

135 
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,390 
Doctor! I thought you wanted me 
and help not kill me. 

136 
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,795 
When I s k ö ß schie nnte, 
k ö nnte me no what, in all of Montana. 

137 
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,673 
Ow! Doctor! 

138 
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,758 
People w rden ü run away from me. 

139 
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,793 
But, boy, not afraid of Frenchy. 

140 
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,070 
(shouts) Oh! Ah! 

141 
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,674 
(screams and st ö) hnt pain 

142 
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,955 
(Piano) 

143 
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,632 
H ö r on yet, but rt h ö any one. 
(Music stops) 

144 
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,793 
300. 

145 
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,195 
Gentleman is 300th Red 

146 
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,758 
- This is too expensive ü f r me. 
- F r ü me too. 

147 
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,235 
- I see it in me. 
- And with the 300th gt ü berschl ä 

148 
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,876 
I see and exceeded location ü

149 
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,356 
- Where is the mine? 
- Dr ü ben on the other side. 

150 
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,516 
Is accepted, 2,000. 

151 
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,590 
- What is it? 
- Everything. 

152 
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,193 
Let's just time, Doctor. 

153 
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,310 
How ß hei t es: BL ä st the wind too strong, 
bow to the Hume st ä ä rksten B. 

154 
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,918 
A moment. 
Prelim ä often available, the tree still. 

155 
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,553 
I see. 

156 
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,116 
An Ass 

157 
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,560 
A pair of deuces. 

158 
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,556 
(M ä male laugh) 

159 
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,240 
What do you do 
with all that money? 

160 
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,750 
To go to Illinois ü ck 
and nd a house num ü? 

161 
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,830 
They are 
not provoke me, doctor Frail. 

162 
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,231 
Take the money, Rune. 

163 
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,233 
What were you trying to say: 
Nd num ü''A House''? 

164 
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,875 
The Red Beard has done nothing 
and h ä tten almost killed him. 

165 
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,878 
Saddle my horse from 
and bring it into the stable. 

166 
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,630 
He said only a little 
of a burned house. 

167 
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,957 
So you ü w rden 
a man killed? 

168 
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,072 
Rune ... 

169 
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,113 
Tomorrow we begin a new life. 

170 
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,470 
We get up at 4:00 clock, 

171 
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,229 
working in the mine until 8:00 Clock. 

172 
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,354 
Then we patch up our patients. 
Got questions? 

173 
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,718 
Any questions to me 
fr heren ü or my life? 

174 
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,872 
- No. 
- Good. Go unsaddle the horse. 

175 
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,309 
This quack was right. 

176 
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,310 
If you are not even the devil, 
He will certainly sits in the neck. 

177 
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,070 
(exciting music) 

178 
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,237 
(Sch ü sse fall 
Horses neighing uneasily) 

179 
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,515 
(Woman screams) 

180 
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,956 
(rapid dramatic music) 

181 
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,392 
(Woman screams) 

182 
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,033 
- 15,000. What do you say? 
- Agreed. 

183 
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,673 
(Frenchy), Hey, Doctor! 

184 
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,032 
Doctor! 

185 
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,515 
In the village, one that is needed 
Their urgent assistance, a coachman. 

186 
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,111 
- He is half dead, was 3 days on the road. 
- And the passengers? 

187 
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,711 
- It was an Ü berfall, all are dead 
- Au ß he a woman. 

188 
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,119 
- She is gone. 
- Says The driver, a real lady. 

189 
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,519 
Mr. Flaunce, you know what they do. 
K ö nnten you are looking for the woman. 

190 
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,678 
- Yes, well. 
- And others are looking for the bandits. 

191 
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,876 
Come not, Doctor? 

192 
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,994 
No. The coachman needs me 
and other patients. 

193 
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,789 
Want to ride with us? 

194 
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,152 
I have no horse. 

195 
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,273 
Take mine. 

196 
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,189 
You trust me? 
And if I did not come back? 

197 
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,154 
No matter where you go, 
the scar w rde ü you ever betrayed. 

198 
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,075 
Which party do you ride? 

199 
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,075 
- Find The Lost Lady. 
- I thought so. 

200 
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,950 
Take good care of that, my property 
not come to harm. 

201 
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,633 
Do not worry, I adjust to the fact 
and also on the horse. 

202 
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,473 
There's something! 

203 
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,710 
She is not in here. 

204 
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,870 
But there is a bag. 

205 
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,278 
Yes, the bag seems to her to go ren ö 

206 
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,600 
You ß t hei Elizabeth Mahler, comes from 
Sweden. Here is a letter to them. 

207 
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,588 
Wei ß the sky, 
what direction it has taken. 

208 
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,556 
H ö to rt! It is better to 
we split into several groups. 

209 
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,555 
In the dark 
We meet in Stump Meadow. 

210 
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,799 
She is now long the sun 
At night, the K ä lte suspended. 

211 
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,788 
If she is dead; 
Give 2 SCH ü from sse if they live 3rd 

212 
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,790 
- A track? 
- No. 

213 
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,390 
- How many people are still on the way? 
- Approximately 12th 

214 
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,398 
Then we will 
tonight are stored here. 

215 
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,399 
In this country, br t ä one day 
At night it freezes. 

216 
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,275 
We have at least 
Ceilings and a fireplace. 

217 
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,071 
But she? 
We no longer find alive. 

218 
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,196 
- You're bleeding, yeah, my son. 
- I ß wei, that was a thorn bush. 

219 
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,473 
- Are you long for Dr. Frail? 
- Not very long. 

220 
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,472 
Then, you use. 

221 
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,754 
Thank you. 

222 
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,750 
I know the doctor about 5 years. 
We then searched for gold. 

223 
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,190 
Sp ter we made ä ä Done forces. 

224 
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,348 
The doc itself tte h l ä ä ngst 
k ö can put to rest. 

225 
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,314 
But he can not 
inseparable from his black bag. 

226 
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,389 
- Maybe he has his soul in it. 
- If he has a soul. 

227 
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,880 
I've even asked the Doc, 
where his name herstammt. Frail. 

228 
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,477 
He said ... 

229 
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,077 
... does the name 
from Norwegian. 

230 
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,189 
Du wei ß t 
It is not his real name. 

231 
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,873 
No. 

232 
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,271 
- A strange man, the doctor. 
- Yes. 

233 
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,394 
He challenges force of death. 

234 
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,796 
The other day he's going to one, 

235 
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,390 
him because of an 
ä has spent nselt go home. 

236 
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,110 
A miracle that he did 
has not killed. 

237 
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,390 
Why would he kill him? 

238 
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,398 
One ä erz hlt the wildest stories. 

239 
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,990 
By a man named Temple 
even the doctor was. 

240 
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,909 
He lived in a city 
where the Ohio into the Mississippi flowing ß t. 

241 
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,159 
He is there a sch ö nes House 
H ü have had on a gel. 

242 
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,477 
And one night 
something happened in that house. 

243 
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,070 
A man and a woman ... 

244 
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,628 
... there should have perished. 

245 
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,515 
And the doctor should 
nds have the house angez ü. 

246 
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,789 
Can still be the charred 
Walls dividing the pastures to see. 

247 
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,833 
- Have you seen it? 
- I think a rattlesnake. 

248 
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,396 
Schie ß t you like to snakes? 
I ja! (laughs) 

249 
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,313 
Lady! 

250 
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,473 
Lady! 

251 
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,794 
Lady! 
I have water. I have water! 

252 
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,590 
Water, lady. Water. 

253 
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,951 
No, no. 
Not so fast, little lady. 

254 
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,070 
Please, lady. I ... 

255 
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,310 
... I'm going 
A few Sch ü like sse. 

256 
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,912 
Lady, please ... 

257 
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,352 
Lady, would you not be afraid. 

258 
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,199 
I shall now give a few Sch ü from sse. 

259 
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,791 
As a sign ü f r my friends, 
I found you. 

260 
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,755 
Believe me, now everything is good. 
Frenchy, it promises you. 

261 
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,509 
(Horses) 

262 
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,235 
- Come here! 
- Is she alive? 

263 
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,954 
Yes, but it has hit them hard. 

264 
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,313 
Come here. Look, how they 
my water bottle festh ä lt 

265 
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,353 
You do not want to let go. 

266 
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,711 
It is more dead than alive. 

267 
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,431 
There is not much 
it ü brig remained. 

268 
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,110 
But what is still there, 
does not ü from bel. (laughs) 

269 
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,631 
This ought to 
only be a compliment. 

270 
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,274 
There's nothing to it. 

271 
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,516 
Come on, we put them on a stretcher 
and bring them to Stump Meadow. 

272 
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,992 
I ride with Dr. Frail and ore ä chairs, 
I found it. 

273 
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,869 
(laughs) Just see here. 

274 
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,071 
It should be h ü bsch? 

275 
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,037 
(Frenchy calls) 
Hey! I've found it! 

276 
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,996 
(general tumult, yelling) 

277 
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,592 
I! Frenchy has found it! 
In the gorge. 

278 
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,279 
I! She's alive! 

279 
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,512 
I've found the woman doctor. 
M ssen ü once you come too. 

280 
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,995 
I have a patient here. 

281 
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,474 
What makes the Red Anna with you? 

282 
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,992 
She is waiting for death. 
She did not die down there. 

283 
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,398 
- The Lady sees it from ö b se. 
- I'm coming as fast as I can. 

284 
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,677 
- F Anna ü r k ö you can do anything. 
- No, that has probably never done one. 

285 
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,440 
But I'll leave it alone. 

286 
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,509 
- How long will it take? 
- 2 hours, I think. 

287 
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,998 
Should I turn around her neck, 
make it faster? 

288 
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,237 
No, doctor, no. 
I say nothing. 

289 
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,752 
I have done my duty, 
Their you do if you'd like to m ö. 

290 
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,352 
(Man) Glad you're here, Doctor. 
She lies dr ben ü. 

291 
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,070 
We 
alternately kept watch, Doctor. 

292 
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,797 
She has 
the whole night, ger ü hrt. 

293 
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,872 
(Frenchy) 
Is scraped off the Red Anna? 

294 
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,312 
(Man) 
Glad you are finally here, Doctor. 

295 
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,197 
- Go ö you ü tte rt H? 
- Yes. 

296 
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,916 
- Who has aufgeschmiert her car grease? 
- I. 

297 
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,239 
Well, that was right. 
Rune, fetch the lamp ü r calc 

298 
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,678 
It occurred to anyone, 
here to make time to clean? 

299 
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,909 
I need a lot of clean water. 
Where the water bottles empty. 

300 
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,319 
(Female st ö hnt) 

301 
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,270 
You always talks to her father. 
He is killed when berfall Ü. 

302 
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,233 
- How hot ß t they? 
- Elizabeth Mahler. 

303 
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,318 
That's my water bottle, doctor. 

304 
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,437 
Whining (Female, incomprehensible ä ndlich) 

305 
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,759 
She has severe burns 
and Gehirnersch ü tterung. 

306 
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,112 
Perhaps internal injuries. 
It is probably blind. 

307 
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,758 
- You will never see again can k ö? 
- I can not say yet. 

308 
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,635 
It was probably the whole day 
unconscious in the sun. 

309 
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,516 
- First, they need time to get out. 
- We ask the trapper to the car. 

310 
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,398 
We still have a small house, 
against ü ber of baby's. 

311 
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,909 
Then k ö nnten bring them. 

312 
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,430 
N Sch ö, I'll get the car. 

313 
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,510 
Do you have enough water, Doctor? 

314 
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,474 
Yes. Put it beside the stove, 
We ü m ssen it boil. 

315 
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,674 
And you, do that, you get out. 

316 
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,195 
Doctor, you will not have time, 
to st ä ndig mmern to them k ü. 

317 
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,312 
When I had finished the housework 

318 
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,478 
and her man 
bring the food must ... 

319 
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,240 
The m ö chte I love to do. 

320 
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,472 
Well, Rune. Thank you. 

321 
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,116 
Hey, boy! 
What need of all the water? 

322 
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,878 
He has to wash them, yes. 

323 
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,193 
Ü berall? 

324 
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,558 
The z ä not yet selected, to a doctor. 

325 
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,713 
(Shouts) You've found it! 
You've found it! 

326 
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,634 
It should be migrated quite fresh. 
Wom ö so resembled a loose woman. 

327 
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,358 
What does this have to do with it? It is 
a stranger here, blind, and severely wounded. 

328 
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,231 
Dr. Frail? My husband has given you 
rashly offered to our house. 

329 
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,115 
- You will not die here. 
- You will not die. 

330 
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,069 
They will live, Ms. Mahler. 
It'll get better. 

331 
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,350 
We are ü ber den Berg. 

332 
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,552 
They (st ö) hnt 

333 
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,273 
- I do not ä gef llt the. 
- Wir m ssen ü down again, come. 

334 
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,714 
(she sobs, crying) 

335 
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,430 
Take the L to the ä. 
The space must remain obscured. 

336 
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,198 
(she cries) 

337 
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,437 
Elizabeth. K ö can you understand me? 

338 
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,430 
The coach was berfall ü. 
The horses have bolted. 

339 
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,394 
- But now you're safe. 
- I need to ü ck. My father ... 

340 
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,912 
- (Sobbing) They are t he ö Ten. 
- You ü m ssen remain calm. 

341 
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,033 
(screams, cries loudly) 

342 
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,679 
(Storm, thunder) 

343 
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,394 
I have found some tea. 

344 
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,912 
Do it in the pot. 

345 
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,276 
I never go rt ö, 
that it imposes someone tea. 

346 
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,275 
BL ö of the book. 
There stands a loss of consciousness may 

347 
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,711 
by a blow 
be on the head triggered ö st. 

348 
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,875 
The further I ß from personal experience 
when I first fell from his horse. 

349 
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,875 
Why erkl ä rt us any that 
what in the interior of K ö RPER happening? 

350 
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,111 
Bring the lamp. 

351 
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,638 
(Rune) You already looks almost 
like a man out. 

352 
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,594 
Why is it lt blo ß ä h 
the canteen so tightly? 

353 
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,999 
If you through so much h ä ttest, 
w ü rdest you do not let go too. 

354 
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,113 
She's awake. 

355 
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,872 
Only half awake. 

356 
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,755 
The other H ä HALF 
is still somewhere else. 

357 
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,715 
We've done it. 

358 
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,591 
I think you can you now 
the canteen away. 

359 
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,111 
- But daf ü r h ä now you find lt. 
- She is calm. 

360 
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,275 
I'll sit here, 
until I losl ä sst. 

361 
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,673 
Go to bed. 

362 
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,317 
Who are you? 

363 
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,313 
I'm a doctor. 

364 
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,274 
Why are my eyes are connected? 

365 
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,759 
The sun has burnt your eye. 

366 
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,678 
The sun. 

367 
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,192 
- Can I see you? 
- Not yet. 

368 
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,599 
Before ü mountain above, 
You understand me, Elizabeth, 

369 
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,268 
They are blind to ü mountain above. 

370 
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,232 
My father ... 

371 
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,358 
... is dead, right? 

372 
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,753 
Yes. 

373 
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,034 
He was berfall get where Ü tet ö. 

374 
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,431 
And he had 
around me so afraid. 

375 
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,150 
Where is he buried? 

376 
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,909 
On the road ß enrand, where was the Ü berfall. 

377 
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,517 
I will now 
get something to eat. 

378 
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,272 
F ü you do not rchten before the 
Alone. I live next door. 

379 
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,353 
Doctor, is there someone f ü me r? 
I mean, a woman? 

380 
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,153 
No. 

381 
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,073 
What I have to? 

382 
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,193 
We have found Their travel bag. 

383 
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,836 
- I have rausgenommen a nightgown. 
- Thank you. 

384 
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,351 
You do 
to worry about. 

385 
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,357 
- Good morning, Rune. 
- The ü Fr hst ck ü is ready. 

386 
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,552 
- Is it enough to even f ü r 3? 
- Nat ü rlich. 

387 
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,716 
Is she better now? 

388 
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,276 
She needs rest. 
It d ü rfen no strangers to her. 

389 
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,393 
Bring the bell above the entrance to ü, 
so that they can call us. 

390 
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,072 
(sweeping, fr ö hliche Music) 

391 
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,954 
(M ä male call and sing) 

392 
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,556 
- Is that all, Mr. Flaunce? 
- More gold, we have not found. 

393 
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,912 
- The vein of gold seems to be the exhaustion. 
- With the never busy. 

394 
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,796 
Here in the area is no one 
become rich. Well, good trip! 

395 
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,156 
Good morning, Rune. 

396 
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,670 
Where did you get the horse from? 

397 
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,918 
The doctor took it in payment. 

398 
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,071 
He l ä sst ask 
if you have fresh eggs. 

399 
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,954 
I have saved you, ck 3 St ü. 

400 
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,231 
How is our beauty Sch ö? 

401 
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,228 
She now sits on the 1.Mal, 
but is still weak. 

402 
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,638 
- Still blind? 
- The doc says it may take yet. 

403 
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,476 
Very fresh eggs. 
They are rare here drau ß en. 

404 
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,832 
- We f dr cken ü ü r Lady thumb. 
- I tell her much. 

405 
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,120 
That makes $ 3, pay at the checkout. 

406 
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,036 
Is not that a bit steep, 
$ 1, the St ü ck? 

407 
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,152 
That is just so. 
The eggs come from far away. 

408 
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,958 
Their doctor is safe 
his practice very determined ä ftigt. 

409 
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,753 
Yes, very. 

410 
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,157 
Well, you go to your Damenkr ä nzchen? 

411 
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,877 
We women want us 
mmern the M ä k ü girl. 

412 
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,550 
If the Doctor needs help 
they will contact. 

413 
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,958 
Maybe she needs help. 
A saint he is not straight. 

414 
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,230 
You there is not a compound, Edna. 

415 
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,796 
A cancel a anst ä ä M dchen 
ö as rt does not go out above. 

416 
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,276 
We will soon know 
where we are with her. 

417 
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,073 
It was a b ö ser winter. 
My mother died this year. 

418 
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,636 
My father said: 
''Come, let us emigrate. 

419 
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,877 
In a country 
which offers us a new future.'' 

420 
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,313 
Oh, it was wonderful. 
The train to St. Louis. 

421 
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,433 
Then the river steamer 
the Missouri River and up. 

422 
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,270 
And then the coach ü about the mountains 
and wide across the steppes. 

423 
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,031 
A wonderful country 
just as in our ä umen Tr. 

424 
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,152 
''And now,''said my father, 

425 
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,878 
''Elizabeth, now we ü m ssen 
Find the right place''. 

426 
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,959 
Did you think 
Here w ä re the right place? 

427 
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,788 
If I can see again, 
wei I ß it. 

428 
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,758 
What you will see is a small 
poor gold-ä Berdorf. 

429 
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,397 
It sweeps away the first Windsto ß, 
when the gold dried up here. 

430 
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,990 
The dregs of humanity 
click here. 

431 
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,512 
- Here w rden ü you do not want to live. 
- Why are you here? And Rune? 

432 
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,471 
- Maybe we'll go ö ren here. 
- I m not ü sste where else 

433 
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,274 
Tell me, what is Rune? 

434 
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,756 
And you, Doctor Frail? 
How do you like? 

435 
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,473 
Rune? The slightly cross-eyed 
and has a little too long fingers. 

436 
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,313 
(laughs) 

437 
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,672 
And the doctor has 
a gray beard and no teeth Z ä. 

438 
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,989 
I further ß that is not true. 
Rune is certainly a Bscher h ü boy. 

439 
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,269 
By Dr. Frail I can 
no idea what to make. 

440 
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,429 
I only know of his H ä nde. 

441 
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,635 
They are tanned by the sun 
and gentle. 

442 
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,798 
And terribly long legs he has. 
He's coming in 3 steps to a T ü r. 

443 
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,991 
As patients arrive 
or unexpected visit. 

444 
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,552 
One woman go ö rt the house here. 

445 
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,551 
The ladies w nschen ü? 

446 
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,958 
- 4 Women Need a doctor? 
- We come to Miss Mahler. 

447 
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,278 
- Miss Mahler Receive ä not ngt. 
- Did she say anything? 

448 
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,758 
No, until she is healthy, 
I decide ü about their welfare. 

449 
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,908 
The inhabitants cancel a anst ä ... 
But what can you afford? 

450 
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,680 
Do I make you a farewell. 

451 
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,838 
So if you 
no help rztliche ä ö ben tigen, 

452 
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,635 
I suggest that you 
hren in baby's own pot r ü. 

453 
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,238 
- Am I a prisoner, Rune? 

454 
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,553 
- Nelly, w ä r 'ne small loan in? 
- From me you will get a cent. 

455 
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,352 
I further ß who I can pump what. 

456 
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,998 
(Piano music, voices) 

457 
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,071 
(quiet, peaceful music) 

458 
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,676 
(eerie music) 

459 
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,518 
Rune? Is anyone there? 

460 
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,077 
Only the good old Frenchy, 
to make his respects. 

461 
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,593 
I was the one you drau ß s 
has found, you can not remember? 

462 
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,952 
I wanted to ask if I 
can have my water bottle. 

463 
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,674 
Excuse me, 
I am not prepared to visit. 

464 
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,112 
But nat ü rlich, Ms. Mahler. 
I do not look down. 

465 
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,073 
Hey! 

466 
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,558 
Almost w ä ren fallen lady. 

467 
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,958 
Since I have you 
2nd Time saved. 

468 
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,517 
But enough of that. There you ä h tte 
well someone else can find k ö. 

469 
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,756 
But perhaps sp ä t 

470 
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,112 
- I ü w rde mich gerne gratefully show. 
- The k ö you can. 

471 
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,871 
I wanted to ask you 
if you help me out a little nnten k ö. 

472 
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,311 
- Nat ü rlich, like what ... 
- Sit down. 

473 
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,197 
I found the place where 
the yellow pebbles are waiting 

474 
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,234 
that they ausbuddelt, 
but unfortunately I lack the funds. 

475 
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,795 
Pebbles? 
They talk about gold? 

476 
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,153 
In quantities as 
here no one has tr ä umen leave. 

477 
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,398 
- W ä ren you do not like rich? 
- Sure.

479 
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,509 
- Ausr ü pation? So you need money? 
- That's right, lady. 

480 
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,550 
I am sorry to you uschen entt ä. 
My father had all our money.

I w ä re so gl ü cklich, 
If I can help you k ö nnte. 

482 
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,320 
Let's not talk more about it. 

483 
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,592 
I wanted to visit so anyway. 

484 
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,318 
But maybe you can me k ö 
another pleasure to do? 

485 
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,989 
For example? 

486 
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,953 
- Mr. Plante was because of the canteen. 
- Yes, yes. 

487 
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,628 
Yes. He has now. 

488 
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,679 
- I think I'd better go. 
- Good night, Mr. Plante. 

489 
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,110 
- Is everything all right, Elizabeth? 
- Yes. 

490 
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,952 
If you no longer need 
I do not what to do. 

491 
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,392 
Rune! Rune! 

492 
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,590 
Bring the bell in order, 
He has cut the cord.

From tomorrow

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,839 
(Music and voices are getting louder) 

496 
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,394 
Joe! Pick up the f ü me r. 

497 
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,352 
(Music stops) 

498 
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,789 
I'm not afraid of you. 
And I have no gun. 

499 
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,559 
Their are all witness. 
I have no gun.

502 
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,395 
Take the razor 
and I put away my gun. 

503

You will not at a 
I do like the H ä hands dirty? 

504 
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,593 
Yes.

506

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,476 
(Uproar, shouts) 

508 
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,436 
If you 
even look up sst l ä ... 

509 
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,359 
whether with or without a gun ... 

510 
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,835 
I will beat you dead 

511 
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,077 
H ö rt me, my ü of Br. 
I warn you again. 

512 
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,196 
This cow doctor 
is possessed by the devil. 

513 
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,949 
Their m ü sst to chase him out of the village! 

514 
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,470 
The doctor wants the little lady 
probably quite f r ü claim him. 

515 
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,993 
Only wait. I 
The final word is still out. 

516 
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,760 
My time will come. 

517 
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,710 
The yet to come. 

518 
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,035 
- Did you get him ö tet? 
- No. 

519 
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,913 
- She says he has done nothing to her. 
- That I do not care. 

520 
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,590 
- I want to see anyone here. 
- It is not lhr property. 

521 
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,150 
Was not it always thus? 

522 
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,911 
Have not you always 
rule the people want? 

523 
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,953 
Come on, Doctor. 
Why do not you beat me? 

524 
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,276 
I'm Their property! 

525 
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,276 
Take the L to the ä. 

526 
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,669 
To be expected lhren eyes are not too much, 
We darken the room. 

527 
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,678 
And now you put me against ü calc 

528 
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,271 
Plug the lamp.

The ß ä u eren Association declined.

Turning up the wick a little deeper. 

531 
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,516 
And now 
I take off the second association. 

532 
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,037 
Please do not expect 
You can immediately see that k ö.

Turning up the wick to the bottom, Rune. 

536 
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,960 
And right now they think of me. 

537 
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,560 
Are you ready, Elizabeth? 

538 
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,475 
Pray f ü r me, Doctor. 

539 
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,828 
Hold the lamp h ö ago, Rune. 

540 
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,428 
éé now Open your eyes. 

541 
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,316 
K ö can you see anything? 

542 
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,396 
No. 

543 
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,597 
Now go with the lamp out and ü ck. 

544 
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,433 
Nothing. 

545 
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,351 
That's not entirely true, Elizabeth. 
Their eyes follow the light. 

546 
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,955 
- Tell me what you see. 
- Please, try it. 

547 
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,109 
- I see some light as if through fog. 
- Something light? That's a lot. 

548 
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,756 
That is more 
seeing as most of us. 

549 
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,352 
And tomorrow you will see a lot more. 

550 
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,635 
I can not see. 

551 
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,433 
But I thank you. 

552 
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,713 
(Horses, whip cracks) 

553 
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,720 
(dramatic music) 

554 
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,073 
(Sch ü sse) 

555 
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,358 
(screams) 

556 
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,992 
What do you have? 

557 
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,430 
(she sobs) 
My eyes! 

558 
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,108 
She says her eyes hurt her to do. 

559 
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,029 
They burn! Like fire! 

560 
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,311 
When was the start? 

561 
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,469 
(sobbing) I went to the T ü r 
and it was f ö additional dark. 

562 
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,877 
(sobs, crying) 
I further ß it! I'm going blind! 

563 
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,673 
Now go out. 

564 
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,990 
- I want to have a look your eye. 
- No! 

565 
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,193 
Let me see your eye. 

566 
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,549 
Let us go out 
and try again. 

567 
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,673 
- No, I can not. 
- Why not? 

568 
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,236 
There was a stagecoach 
is davongerast. 

569 
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,590 
A man began to schie ß en. 

570 
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,793 
- I want to see again. 
- I think you can k ö see very well. 

571 
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,280 
Take Their H ä hands down. 

572 
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,196 
Now h ö ren me too well. 

573 
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,996 
If you keep your eyes closed, 
h ö ä ren Ger usche and think 

574 
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,997 
st rzt ü one of the world. 

575 
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,591 
But if you keep them open, 
You see things as they are. 

576 
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,352 
I can not. 

577 
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,469 
I'll leave you here alone. 
You are on the brink of an abyss. 

578 
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,557 
I'll give you some advice: 

579 
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,514 
Do not go 
with eyes closed through life. 

580 
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,472 
(Rune) You can see them. 

581 
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,912 
It is free. 

582 
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,960 
Why do not you go home? 

583 
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,635 
I wait until you go. 

584 
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,398 
Take your time not be too long. 

585 
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,232 
Please, sir. 

586 
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,278 
It has f ü r us home

587 
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,754 
I apologize to her. 
Tell her I'm ftigt decided ä. 

588 
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,520 
You k ö they can not be treated. 

589 
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,557 
You k now ü mmerst 
a bit too much for me. 

590 
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,469 
You seem to have forgotten that 
who who go ö rt. 

591 
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,672 
Cards, Doctor? 

592 
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,312 
Do you want tickets? 

593 
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,393 
Yes, 2 

594 
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,994 
- We have been waiting for you. 
- I could not come sooner. 

595 
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,591 
Are you afraid of me, 
because I'm healthy? 

596 
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,191 
No, I am pleased 
that you are healthy. 

597 
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,279 
Excuse me. 
Good night. 

598 
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,112 
- You h ä tten should not come here. 
- The further I ß. 

599 
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,434 
Go back ü r calc 
And tomorrow, take the stagecoach. 

600 
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,314 
Coach? Where should I go? 

601 
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,830 
To New York. And then home. 
Then you should go. 

602 
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,350 
- And what I do there? 
- You have relatives. 

603 
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,075 
Here you have no one. 
This is no place you ü f r. 

604 
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,475 
K ö, you can not stay here. 

605 
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,557 
Why do you do? 

606 
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,915 
Because you go ü m ssen. 
And because I want to stay here. 

607 
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,668 
Please send me away. 

608 
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,112 
They will pack up tomorrow. 
I'll take you to the coach. 

609 
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,470 
No, you do not. 

610 
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,595 
And you will never tell me again, 
what am I to do or not do. 

611 
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,917 
I take 
Tomorrow fr ü h not the coach. 

612 
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,715 
I have come 
to make me a home. 

613 
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,672 
And I want to do. 

614 
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,118 
At 6 weeks, the can 
to be a ghost of Ernest. 

615 
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,152 
I'll be here! 

616 
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:46,672 
I plant wheat f ü r ghosts 
and z ü chte cattle f ü r ghosts. 

617 
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,190 
- And build my haunted house! 
- With ghosts of money? 

618 
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,479 
Do I obtain money. 
Somehow I managed it. 

619 
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,437 
And if only to sufficient 
You pay my debts. 

620

Give me the ball to ü ck, 
They have lifted. 

621 
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,480 
I have thrown away a long time. 

622 
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,913 
Thrown away?

I f you worked ü r, 
without it ü m ssen? 

624 
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,833 
- Looks like it. 
- I am not free? 

625 
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,717 
Who of you wants to be smart, 
must be the first born. 

626 
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,875 
Rune? 

627 
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:45,437 
You can also keep the horse,

628 
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,516 
Good morning. My name is 
Elizabeth Mahler. Thank you very much.

01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,118 
Day, Rune. 
And that is the missing Sch ö ne? 

630 
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,312 
- My name is Elizabeth Mahler. 
- Very pleased. 

631 
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,475 
Thank you, all mine. 

632 
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,554 
- Welcome, Ms. Mahler. 
- Thank you. 

633 
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,275 
It sends you is not f ü r 
Addressing strangers. 

634 
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,632 
Talk to me and I answer. 
Good morning. 

635 
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,792 
- May I? 
- We do not need help! 

636 
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,276 
Thank you very much. 
My name is Elizabeth Mahler. 

637 
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,790 
- Come on, finally. 
- It was a joy to me gen ü 

638 
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,269 
(Elizabeth) Good morning. 

639 
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,909 
- Are you Mrs. Flaunce? 
- Yes. 

640 
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,829 
- I m ö chte talk baby's husband. 
- I'm here, Miss Mahler. 

641 
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,479 
Excuse me. Thank you. 

642 
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,473 
Good day. 

643 
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,036 
Rune has told me 
how helpful they were. 

644 
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,834 
Glad 
that you are healthy again. 

645 
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,556 
Thank you. 
I m ö chte one Minenausr ü pation. 

646 
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,513 
Excuse me? 

647 
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,917 
Rune and I 
want to go fossicking. 

648 
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,798 
I see. 
Fits for the f r ü a woman? 

649 
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,913 
- I'm still there. 
- I f rchte ü hard work is not. 

650 
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,237 
W ü you rden me 
then a Ausr ü pation borrow? 

651 
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,115 
It is very valuable, 
one Familienerbst ü ck. 

652 
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,677 
The stones are really very rare. 

653 
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,990 
This is an exciting St ü ck. 
I have a magnifying glass in the apartment. 

654 
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,795 
Do you have any objection 
n ä me when I look at her? 

655 
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,355 
Nat ü rlich not. Please. 

656 
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,638 
- Doctor, she wants a Minenausr ü pation. 
- I thought so. 

657 
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,595 
She wants to borrow money then. 
This should be an old Erbst ü ck. 

658 
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,553 
Do you think 
That is more than $ 20 worth? 

659 
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,828 
Tell her that you are her 
umen an open credit Einr ä. 

660 
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,874 
All right, Doctor. 
If you daf ü r underwrite. 

661 
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,593 
Well? 

662 
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,114 
Your Frenchy was not lying! 

663 
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,995 
Give me the money 
and it can go to work. 

664 
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,749 
No, first 
We discuss the events ä products. 

665 
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:54,033 
It's embarrassing, with a lady 
Done ä ü ber fte speak. 

666 
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,756 
- Mr. Plante, we get down to business. 
- Substance. 

667 
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,518 
To the point. 

668 
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,158 
What do you think of 20%? 
Gro ß z ü giger as I can be. 

669 
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,878 
I can at any time Ausr ü pation 
get to 5 or 10%. 

670 
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,549 
Why do you do it then? 

671 
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,870 
No, 20% is too little. 

672 
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,192 
We want 50%. 

673 
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,508 
- The k ö you can accept or ... 
- Reject. 

674 
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,153 
Yes, or reject it. 

675 
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,751 
- 50%. 
- 50%. 

676 
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,797 
Because you are. 
Here's my hand on it. 

677 
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:36,318 
No, first we go to Mr. Flaunce 
and make the contract. 

678 
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,308 
And then we shake hands. 
Agreed? 

679 
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:48,959 
''... erkl ä ren to indemnify, 
that if one partner

681 
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,153 
Brrrrrrr! 

682 
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,838 
I catch the groove 
up there at the waterfall at 

683 
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,112 
and f ü them down hre 
behind the tree in the creek. 

684 
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,949 
I'll beat the sh ü Geb. 

685 
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,151 
Well, the proud owner of mine? 

686 
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:14,512 
Sit down there in the shade. 
Frenchy does everything alone. 

687 
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:19,316 
I will participate as you are. 
Please consider me as a man 

688 
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,318 
(laughs) 
That will not be easy. 

689 
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,797 
A better verbal ä EMPLOYMENT f ü r lts 
H ä hands will help you cause. 

690 
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,355 
Well, you are 'ne number, you know. 
They are really 'ne dolle number. 

691 
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,992 
Go up 
and f ä lle wood f ü r the gutter. 

692 
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,274 
(euphoric music) 

693 
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,309 
Rune! Rune! 
Go up to the water! 

694 
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,475 
So now we are ready 
to wash the sand. 

695 
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,830 
Down with the water! 

696 
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,318 
(Cheers) 

697 
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,193 
(Laughter) 

698 
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,114 
K ö Now we can begin to dig. 

699 
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,357 
Now we de rei ß Earth 
the gold from the body, 

700 
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,348 
here 
lies hidden for millions of years. 

701 
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,757 
10 meters of cotton fabric. 
Whoever gets the child? 

702 
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,871 
The wife of Russell. 

703 
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:49,200 
How I know she wants to 4 dozen 
Diapers. Since we prefer to take 12 m. 

704 
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,519 
Tell me, have Flaunce, you 
which go from the river above ö rt? 

705 
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,756 
Do you have some nostalgia? 

706 
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,316 
No, I just wanted to know 
how's ben since ü dr. 

707 
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,557 
- The mine is in operation. 
- With Success? 

708 
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,236 
Not likely. 

709 
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,228 
Only 5 ounces to 3 weeks. 
That hardly covers the interest. 

710 
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,231 
It takes time. 

711 
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,238 
It has 
f ü r ü about $ 1,000 of goods taken. 

712 
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,955 
- And I will continue to give her credit? 
- Yes. 

713 
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,790 
- Even if nothing comes out? 
- Even if I lose every penny. 

714 
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,590 
It is indeed nothing to me, Doctor. 

715 
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,316 
When Done ä ftsmann I do not understand 
how do you come to Their Costs. 

716 
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,911 
I am not an event ftsmann ä and 
therefore accountable to no one. 

717 
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,956 
Thank you 
the matter be kept confidential. 

718 
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,390 
Not even my wife wei ß them. 

719 
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,434 
I promised Russell 
I watch him think. 

720 
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,952 
He was probably more scared than his wife. 
M ä Men are funny. 

721 
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:57,870 
How many M ä male by their wives 
the G ä ngelband let f hren ü.

01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,395 
(Baby cries) 

723 
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,151 
The k ü rzeste ü way is via the comb 
and then along the river, Doctor.

MINE LUCKY LADY'''' 
OWNER: E. MAHLER, F. PLANTE, RUNE 

725 
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,469 
In about one months ü 
we have found almost nothing. 

726 
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,989 
I'm just not ü Gl ck. 

727 
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,436 
- We have ü m ssen patience. 
- Patience is something I have not. 

728 
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:59,631 
Good day, Doctor. I am pleased 
that you can look at times. 

729 
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,195 
I visited a patient. 

730 
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,998 
- M ö you'd like some coffee? 
- Yes, please. 

731 
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,514 
Thank you. 

732 
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,876 
Do not tell a doctor weight ö hnlich: 
''How are you? '' 

733 
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,594 
And:''You see once your tongue''? 

734 
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,950 
I see how you feel. 

735 
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,592 
Is it me good? 

736 
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,634 
- Show me nde Their H ä. 
- They're dirty. 

737 
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,119 
Maybe I should ask 
how are you? 

738 
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:54,713 
Come stop by on occasion. 
I'll give you what f ü r lts H ä nde. 

739 
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,559 
Thank you, Doctor.

Lucky Lady''''. 
Have Eq ü ck? 

741 
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,989 
No, but a little bit of hope 
can not hurt. 

742 
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,353 
How is Rune? 

743 
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,311 
They are missing two of us. 

744 
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,030 
What do you want? 
Spying on us? 

745 
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,112 
What's the matter, 
what he can not see? 

746 
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,033 
Well, Rune? 

747 
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,992 
To work, Rune! 

748 
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,874 
Ren you go ö only 50% of this hole. 

749 
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,470 
I will certainly 
not more than 50% dirt digging. 

750 
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,834 
Why do not we cut the crap go? 

751 
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,715 
Do it all. But then 
ö go mine rune and my rt. 

752 
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,673 
My share k ö nnt have it cheap. 

753 
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:43,589 
And why ü w rde Mr. Plante 
so much money vorschie ß s, 

754 
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,234 
if he does not believe in the mine? 

755 
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,834 
Why you must ü m 
Watch a woman like that? 

756 
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:08,228 
If a partner is not certain rights? 
So take a look but does not hurt. 

757 
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:11,398 
You have to be well doctor 
in order to rfen the d ü. 

758 
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,991 
As you probably nnte k ö 
allow even more. 

759 
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,278 
You really are a tough old boot. 

760 
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,758 
But wait a minute. 

761 
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,269 
That's better than nothing. 

762 
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,273 
Rune! 

763 
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,671 
I walk into the village. 
I m ö chte that you come with me.

01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,839 
K ö you can stay calm here. 
It happens you nothing.

See you tomorrow, Frenchy. 

766 
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,156 
From today I'm going at night 
stay down in the village. 

767 
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,635 
I come here just to work. 

768

(Sob) 

769 
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,312 
I have the plague, eh? 

770 
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,352 
The plague. 

771 
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:19,757 
For a moment, 
I'll just change. 

772 
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,272 
Good evening. 

773 
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,315 
Good evening, Mrs. Flaunce. 
Our vorr ä te come to an end. 

774 
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,916 
I ask for an advance or 
my needle. 

775 
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,671 
Their Unsch ä tzbare needle! 
The sack of potatoes is not worth it. 

776 
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,511 
Excuse me, what do you think? 

777 
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,836 
I've seen lhr account register. 

778 
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,554 
The needle

779 
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,228 
- What do you want? 
- Do not play the innocent. 

780 
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:56,638 
So you know: Dr. Frail 
has advanced to you the money. 

781

K ö us we can well imagine 
She told him how to ckzahlen ü.

$ 1119, you were worth it so far. 
Running up like a whore! 

784 
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,590 
L ü gnerin. Common wrong queue. 
One should trample you. 

785 
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,956 
At some point, somehow 
I pay every penny for ü ck. 

786 
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,958 
- What you pay for ü ck? 
- I was in the shop. 

787 
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,711 
Mrs. Flaunce says you made me think. 
They even called me a whore. 

788 
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,397 
That was not my intention. 
I'm sorry. 

789 
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,952 
- Better to leave the city. 
- Do not meddle in my life! 

790 
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,074 
Who gives you the right to 
playing with people's lives like that? 

791 
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:15,795 
Drag the people themselves 
and sto s ß them out. 

792 
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,835 
- Gef ä it llt you, len people ä qu? 
- Not at all. 

793 
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,271 
But you qu ä len us! 
Rune just like me. 

794 
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:28,156 
- Life is political once r ä. 
- Maybe it already has. 

795 
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,919 
Then it is true 
what one ä erz hlt. 

796 
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:36,910 
- From the woman who killed herself. 
- Yes, that's true. 

797 
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:45,591 
I was married to this woman. 
And the man was my brother. 

798 
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,679 
I have no right to forget. 

799 
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,194 
M ö you'd like me more erz hlen ä? 

800 
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:06,590 
This is a tincture from plants ö l. 
I have you f ü r produced. 

801 
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,554 
It will heal Their H ä nde 
gardens and at the same time surveilance ä. 

802 
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,914 
I'm at the end! I'm ready! 
I can not stand it any longer. 

803 
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:47,392 
But what we have found 
but must come from somewhere! 

804 
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:53,517 
Somewhere, yes! This is probably 
of the Flood ü brig remained. 

805 
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,031 
(Rumble, squeak) 

806 
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,356 
What is it? 

807 
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,030 
The whole earth is moving! 

808 
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,196 
Caution, the tree! 

809 
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,311 
(Elizabeth) Rune! 

810 
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,272 
- Rune! 
- Here I am. 

811 
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,710 
- This is gold! 
- What is it? 

812 
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,353 
Gold. 

813 
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,396 
The roots of the tree 
have held it. 

814 
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,638 
Where are you? 
The freeze is in Tr ü mmer gone. 

815 
01:27:55,400 --> 01:28:00,030 
Where are you? 
What are you doing in that hole? 

816 
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,313 
Look. 

817 
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,993 
A miracle. 

818 
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:14,675 
Here, here. In the tree. 

819 
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,714 
- A miracle!

820 
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,036 
We are ü ckspilze Eq.

(Frenchy) A miracle! 

823 
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,558 
Come on everyone! 

824 
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,710 
A miracle! A miracle! 

825 
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,234 
(M ä male call and sing) 

826 
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,991 
The lady and I have so much gold 
that we do not know where to put it. 

827 
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:01,149 
We have the art, and gr sch ö ö ß te mine 
has it ever been in the area. 

828 
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,910

829 
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,670

GOLDK ö rner so ß large as peas.

Tomorrow I'll show you mine. 
But today we celebrate! 

833 
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:20,391 
This is the gr ö ß th Celebration

Rub my arm with it.

Thanks sch ö n

01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:41,439 
No, no, lass. 
I want to take home with them. 

839 
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,836 
All right, partner. 

840 
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,073 
- This is my little advance. 
- Do what you want. 

841 
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,831 
All those with me today, the city

842

Come on, guys! Come on!

Now is celebrated. 
Frenchy buys the store.

(general laughter and jeers) 

848 
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:44,429 
Wei ß t you remember last Sunday? 
Because you wanted to know anything about me. 

849 
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,076 
What makes it a bit of gold, eh? 

850 
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,516 
- Take it's better to Flaunce. 
- No, I need it here. 

851

Yes.

855

Burn the dirty clothes. 
Burn them! Burn them!

We nd z ü at a bonfire

Dr. Frail is here too?

01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,430 
A mine is eingest ü rzt,

871

01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:11,434 
- The doctor is not there.

873 
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:16,476 
Thanks, but I do not drink. 
I am invited to a celebration. 

874 
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,719 
- What is happening?

875 
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,399 
I bring you some flowers.

F r ü me flowers? 

877

Why? 

880 
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:05,352 
I'm almost finished, then 
we go together with Rune into the village. 

881 
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,358 
Why is the village? 
You and I are partners.

K ö we can celebrate as well. 
Right here ... 

883

But first we drink. 

884 
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,752 
Come to Frenchy. 

885 
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,757 
Or do you want 
Frenchy that comes to you? 

886 
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,996 
Frenchy is ready for anything. 

887 
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,509 
(The mob cheered and gr ö lt) 

888 
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,754 
The House of the cow doctor! 
Infects his house!

Crubb goads on the people

891 
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,440 
Frenchy has waited long enough.

893 
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,596

M ö rder! Schl ä chter!

898 
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:50,797 
(the crowd rages loudly) 

899 
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,635 
We feel this is the most humane way 
you Ten. to t ö 

900 
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,593 
We take away the car

01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:36,237
Tell your saying, Crubb.

902
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:39,873

01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,158
Their k ö nnt have everything
what we possess.

907
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,750
Rune is my partner.
He agrees.

908
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,919
Please take it.
We are the bottom of Flaunces shop.

909
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,272
There is so much.
Please take it.

I tell you what:
She wants to buy their guy.

917
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:54,590
I should be glad.

918
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,032
Frenchy said
the mine is worth millions.

919
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,117
(Crubb) Help! To me!

920
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,277
