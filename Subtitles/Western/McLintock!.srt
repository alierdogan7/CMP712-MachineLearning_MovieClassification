1
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,910
Love in the country

2
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,350
Where skies are blue

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,890
All you'll be dreaming of

4
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,360
Are the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees

5
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,160
Till you're up to
your knees in love

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,330
There's a treehouse
in the meadow

7
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,530
Below the mountain peak

8
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,870
The perfect place for lovers

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,670
When they play hide and seek

10
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,570
There's a covered bridge
at Crippled Creek

11
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,010
Where the horses always stop

12
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,170
'Tween the treehouse

13
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,200
And the covered bridge

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,840
That's how Mom won Pop

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
By making love
in the country

16
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,920
Where skies are blue

17
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,390
All you'll be dreaming of

18
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,130
Are the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees

19
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,900
Till you're up to
your knees in love

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,400
There are roses
on the trellis

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,410
And the scent
of new-mown hay

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,670
The clingin' vine is jealous

23
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,840
On the fence across the way

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,970
There's a great big yellow
moon above

25
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,040
And a breeze to sing a song

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,140
'Tween the roses
and the yellow moon

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,410
A fella can't go wrong

28
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,580
When he makes

29
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,590
Love in the country

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,860
Where skies are blue

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,960
All you'll be dreamin' of

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,020
Are the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees

33
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,040
Till you're up to
your knees in love!

34
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,410
(Children shouting excitedly)

35
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:35,762
CURLY: Lord to goodness.
Not again.

36
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:52,654
CURLY: Howdy, Drago.
DRAGO: Morning, Curly.

37
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:56,324
Makes seven times this month
he come home swaggled.

38
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,575
DRAGO: Six.
- CURLY: Seven.

39
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,869
Six. Once was his birthday.
That don't count.

40
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:01,287
Give me my buggy whip.

41
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:04,666
Didn't have anything for breakfast
but two raw eggs and a mug of honey.

42
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,876
CURLY: No!
G.W: Curly!

43
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,336
CURLY: Yes, Boss?

44
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:14,592
Don't say it's a fine morning,
or I'll shoot you.

45
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,514
Get out of here, Bunyan.

46
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:22,016
G.W.: Good morning.
CHlLDREN: Good morning.

47
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,811
Carlos, what are you
doing up there?

48
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,188
I hope I get it
this time, Mr. McLintock.

49
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:30,275
My brothers... they got
the big hats already.

50
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:40,827
All right. Let 'em have at it.

51
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,000
(Gunshot)

52
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:55,592
Get over.

53
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:58,470
DRAGO: Did you want to let me drive?
You promised me you would sometime.

54
00:03:58,595 --> 00:03:59,637
No! Ya!

55
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,142
DRAGO: Boss, you better
watch that turn on the road!

56
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,978
You're gonna kill
both of us one of these days.

57
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:12,859
Thank you, Mr. Boss!

58
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,300
(Cattle mooing)

59
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:32,045
You got cattle
in the bank, Boss.

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,840
Ya!

61
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,012
G.W: Giddyap. Ya!

62
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,198
Keep 'em going.

63
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:04,327
15 cents a pound
all the way to Kansas City.

64
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Ya! Ya!

65
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,560
Now, Boss, there's
one old pensioner...

66
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,560
I wish you'd pass up.

67
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,217
- Bunny?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:03,261
G.W: Wish I knew where
I'd seen his face before.

69
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:04,762
DRAGO: He ain't an old timer.

70
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:06,848
He's just been around town
a couple of years.

71
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:09,642
G.W: Aw, you have no milk
of human kindness.

72
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,563
Morning, Mr. McLintock.

73
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:16,858
- Morning, Bunny.
- Well, I can see you're in good health.

74
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:20,611
Never felt better,
contrary to what you may hear.

75
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:24,157
My kidneys ain't
what they used to be,

76
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:27,910
and my liver's been leaving me bilious.
- Drago!

77
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,910
DRAGO: Eh.

78
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,211
- Hello, Ben.
- Hey, McLintock.

79
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:43,176
- Drago, throw that in the buggy.
DRAGO: Yes, sir.

80
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:48,222
BEN: That's a scrubby bunch of sooners, huh?
G.W: They are at that.

81
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:54,020
YOUNG BEN: That ought to make Douglas
happy, lining his pockets with land fees.

82
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:56,731
BEN: What are we going to do?

83
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:01,027
I don't know what you're gonna do, Ben.
Me... I do nothing.

84
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:05,364
200 families. Quarter of beef
a week per family.

85
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:08,826
lf they last two years,
that can be a sizable number.

86
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,780
I got 20 head to one of any...

87
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,624
other brand on the Mesa Verde.
I'm not hollering.

88
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:18,169
Some of us haven't got
all the money in the world.

89
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:22,048
Some of us ain't old and tired
and feel like being put upon.

90
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,051
You interest me, Young Ben.
Go on.

91
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,639
The first time I find one of
our hides wearing our brand...

92
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:34,143
hung on one of them settler's fences,
I aim to kill me a plow boy.

93
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:38,898
You do what you want, McLintock.
We'll do what we want.

94
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:44,195
Fellas my age generally
call me "G.W." or "McLintock".

95
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,281
Youngsters call me
"Mr. McLintock".

96
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,535
All right, "Mr. McLintock",

97
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:55,748
not because I'm afraid of you.
You're the big yeast out of this country,

98
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:59,126
and I reckon a fella my age
should call you "mister".

99
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:04,215
He's full grown now, G.W.
He's a half-owner of the spread.

100
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:09,220
I made him a full partner,
the day the doc gave me the long face.

101
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:10,721
Well, you want him to vote...

102
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:13,724
the first time this territory
becomes a state, don't you?

103
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,393
Of course, I do.

104
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:18,688
These settlers get burned out,
there'll be a lot of hollering...

105
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:21,232
that this country's too wild
to be a state,

106
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:24,694
and we'll go on being
a territory some more,

107
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:27,238
with a lot of political
appointees running it...

108
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:30,324
according to what they learned
in some college...

109
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,411
where they think that cows
are something you milk,

110
00:08:33,536 --> 00:08:36,956
and lndians are something
in front of a cigar store.

111
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,459
I'm looking to you
to hold Young Ben down.

112
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:42,503
BEN:
I'll do what I can.

113
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:47,842
G. W: Come on over to the house once in a while.
We'll rack up a few hands of stud.

114
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,094
BEN:
G.W., that'll be just fine.

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,774
MAN: It's a nice morning,
ain't it, Boss?

116
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,152
G. W: Everybody's entitled
to their own opinion.

117
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:09,488
MAN: Like that again, eh?
Here's something that'll cheer you up.

118
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:12,742
About 1,000 head. l figure
they'll bring about $1,250.

119
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,286
G. W: They're not as fat
as I'd like to ship.

120
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:18,247
G. W: They all off the north range?
MAN: Yes, sir.

121
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:23,544
Settlers. Every one of them
with a plow and a Bible,

122
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:26,630
not the slightest idea
of what the range is for.

123
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,383
Drago!

124
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:32,762
G. W: Drag out that hog-legg.
DRAGO: Yes, sir.

125
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,930
G. W: Get me some attention.

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,930
(Gunshot)

127
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,830
Hee ya!

128
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:40,770
People, people, people!

129
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,310
People!

130
00:09:47,443 --> 00:09:50,237
DRAGO: Come on, all of you! Gather around.

131
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:53,365
People, come on! Gather around.

132
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,120
l'm McLintock.

133
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,916
You people planned a homestead
and farmed the Mesa Verde.

134
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,044
MAN: Yes, sir. The government
give us each 160 acres.

135
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:08,214
The government never gave
anybody anything.

136
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,800
Some years back,
a lot like you came in.

137
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:15,513
They had a pretty good first year
good summer, easy winter.

138
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:19,475
But the next year,
the last rain was in February,

139
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,687
and by June, even the jackrabbits had
sense enough to get off the Mesa.

140
00:10:23,812 --> 00:10:27,691
Folks, do you know who that is? That's McLintock...

141
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,694
"George Washington McLintock."

142
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:32,905
I told them that, Douglas.

143
00:10:33,072 --> 00:10:37,910
DOUGLAS: He controls the water rights,
on 200 square miles of range.

144
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:42,498
You know that lumber you got?
That came from his land.

145
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:46,001
Cut by his loggers
and milled in his mills.

146
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:50,714
Douglas, I come close to killing you a
couple of times, when we were younger.

147
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,133
Saddens me I didn't.

148
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:56,470
DOUGLAS: Can you imagine
a man who owns all that...

149
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:59,640
Oh, and mines, too.
I forgot to mention them...

150
00:11:00,182 --> 00:11:04,510
All that, and he's begrudging
poor people a measly...

151
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,690
a measly, 160 acres.

152
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:09,692
That right, Mr. McLintock?

153
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:14,321
- You begrudge us a little free land?
- There's no such thing as free land.

154
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:18,117
If you make these homesteads go,
you'll have earned every acre of it,

155
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:21,370
but you just can't make 'em go
on the Mesa Verde.

156
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,542
God made that country for buffalo.
It serves pretty well for cattle,

157
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,502
but it hates the plow.

158
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,839
And even the government
should know...

159
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:35,676
that you can't farm 6,000 feet
above sea level.

160
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:39,013
- Any trouble, Mr. McLintock?
- No trouble, Sheriff.

161
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,400
- How about you, Douglas?
- "Douglas?"

162
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:56,405
Just plain "Douglas," eh?
And you call him "Mr. McLintock".

163
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:58,032
Why?

164
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:01,910
Well, "Douglas," I guess
it's because he earned it.

165
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:11,503
- Mr. McLintock?
- Yeah?

166
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:15,299
I'm a good hand with cattle, Mr. McLintock.
I'd like a job.

167
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:19,344
Well, you look strong enough.
You come in with those sooners?

168
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:22,097
Well, yes, sir, but we don't
have a homestead.

169
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:23,849
G. W: Can't use you.

170
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:41,241
Tough life, ain't it, sonny?

171
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:45,954
Well, ain't much future in being
a farmer around these parts.

172
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:10,729
Ladies, this is the finest chantilly lace,
available anywhere.

173
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:14,608
(French pronunciation) <i>"Chantilly"</i>, Mr. Birnbaum.
- Well, believe me, it's the best.

174
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:18,111
Oh, excuse me. Please, look around.
Take your time.

175
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:21,865
Drago, I got 1,000 Havana cigars,
and 12 of those hats for you over there.

176
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,430
Them big hats ain't going to
last long the way some folks...

177
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,788
have been dipping
into that redeye these days.

178
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,300
Uh-oh.

179
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,166
Good morning, G.W.

180
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,335
Good morning.
I stole some stick candy.

181
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,838
Please. Help yourself.
Come on in.

182
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:43,387
Davey! You can forget about
saddling up the horse!

183
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,720
Come in here!

184
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,680
- Problem?
- Yes.

185
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:50,852
Well, if I were blacks, I'd move
queen's bishop to king 4.

186
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:55,649
Yeah. You might be right.

187
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:58,569
You know, I was just starting to work this out
when the letter came.

188
00:13:58,694 --> 00:13:59,695
Letter?

189
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,947
- It was...
- DAVEY: What happened? Don't you want...

190
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:04,074
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- Morning, Davey.

191
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,493
DAVEY: You being here
saved me a trip.

192
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:10,247
Oh, that hat and suit of clothes
you picked out for my birthday...

193
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:13,125
well, instead of
this cowboy hat,

194
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,588
I'd like to have this one, if it's,
uh, all right with you, sir.

195
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:19,464
G.W: Well, it's all right
with me, Davey.

196
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,466
Of course, that looks like
the kind of a hat...

197
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:24,130
a fella'd wear down Main Street
to start a fight

198
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,887
DAVEY: Oh, l don't need
a city hat for that.

199
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,764
All l have to do
is walk down the street,

200
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,310
and some wiseacre will call me an "Indian",
and, just like that, the fight's on.

201
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:35,522
BlRNBAUM: Davey, the letter. It's for you.
And you are an Indian.

202
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:40,277
DAVEY: Yes, l know I'm an Indian,
but I'm also the fastest runner in town.

203
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:43,613
I've got a college education,
and I'm the railroad telegrapher,

204
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:47,075
but does anybody say, "Hello, college man"
or "Hello, runner"...

205
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,620
or "Hello, telegrapher"? No!
Not even "Hello, knothead..."

206
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:51,788
BlRNBAUM: Davey.

207
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:54,124
DAVEY: It's always,
"Let the Indian do it."

208
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,084
BlRNBAUM: Will you go out in
the store and help the ladies?

209
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,088
DAVEY: All right. I'm also
a bookkeeper, part-time clerk.

210
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:03,759
Always, "Let the Indian do it."

211
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,304
BlRNBAUM: A lady brought that
out here this morning,

212
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,307
asked for it to be taken out
to the home ranch for you.

213
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:13,226
Handsome lady.
Kind of tall with red hair.

214
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:16,938
Called me "Mr. Birnbaum", just as
if she'd never seen me before...

215
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:21,151
and as if that veil that covered her face
could keep me from recognizing her.

216
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:25,238
I thought she was in New York
or Europe or someplace.

217
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:26,823
G.W: So did l.

218
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:30,827
DRAGO: Jake, you better throw on a couple
extra cases of the bosses favorite bourbon.

219
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:33,955
That stuff sure gets used up
fast out at our place.

220
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:37,709
G.W: Which reminds me,
you better start tapering off.

221
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,700
DRAGO: Huh!

222
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:43,298
- Katherine's in town.
- Katie?!

223
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:52,974
Ladies.

224
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:55,352
Good morning.

225
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:03,151
MEN: Morning, Mr. McLintock.
Morning, Mr. McLintock.

226
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:13,036
G.W: Morning.
- Good morning.

227
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,205
WOMEN: Morning.
G.W: Fauntleroy.

228
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,665
Morning, G.W.

229
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,084
What are you doing in here?
Why aren't you out at the desk?

230
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,502
Helping out the bartender.

231
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:24,130
Yeah, I see. A busy day.
Give me the key to room 17.

232
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,465
What?

233
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,093
17, and don't advertise it.

234
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,723
Here they come,
Mr. McLintock.

235
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:38,603
G.W: Set 'em up.

236
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:40,146
- Beer.
- Whiskey.

237
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:43,859
Day off?

238
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:46,778
Off day.

239
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:51,783
Wonder what he's
so preoccupied about.

240
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:54,286
- Haven't you heard?
- No. What?

241
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,663
- Katie's back in town.
- Katie?

242
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:59,416
Yes, dear.
The social arbiter.

243
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:04,087
- Well, hi, sonny.
- Good morning. Oh!

244
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,080
(Women laugh)

245
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:08,174
WOMAN: He sure is a polite one.

246
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,385
Mr. McLintock, l don't
want to bother you...

247
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,221
I'm sorry, boy.
l told you, no job.

248
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:49,132
Katherine.

249
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,010
George Washington McLintock.

250
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:01,853
I thought you'd want this.

251
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,069
G.W:
First dig of the spur,

252
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:12,364
but who am I
to upset your plans?

253
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:17,827
- Don't you feel kind of silly?
KATHERlNE: I never feel silly.

254
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:21,081
G.W: It's because you have
no sense of humor.

255
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:24,376
Why couldn't we sit down
in the hotel dining room...

256
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,753
and talk about whatever it is
you want to talk about?

257
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:29,214
Or why couldn't you just come
over to the house?

258
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,424
And have everybody know
that we're meeting?

259
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,178
Everybody knows, and what's
the difference? We're married.

260
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,598
That is something
I should like to change.

261
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,898
You know the answer, Katie.

262
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:50,568
That isn't why you sent for me.

263
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,862
Let's get to the rat killing.

264
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:57,909
That's just the kind of remark
that's always endeared you to me.

265
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:01,010
Let us open the discussion.

266
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,042
Very well. Our daughter is coming home in a
few days, or, rather, she's coming here.

267
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:10,588
It was just a slip of the tongue that made me
refer to this ugly hamlet as home.

268
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:14,342
"Our daughter?" ls it so hard
to say her name? It's Becky.

269
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,928
Rebecca! l hate that name.

270
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,722
Anyway, she's coming home,

271
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:23,685
and l hoped to persuade you
to let her live with me...

272
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,771
part of the time in the capital,
part of the time in New York,

273
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:30,066
and, of course,
Newport during the season.

274
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,946
You're whistling
in the wind, Katie.

275
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:36,739
If she stays here,

276
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,993
she'll become just as crude and as vulgar,
as all of this country.

277
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:43,621
And if she goes your way,
she'll be all show and no stay.

278
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,620
Oh.

279
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,006
No go, Kate.

280
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,968
KATE: l hate you.
Oh, how l hate you!

281
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:00,722
G.W: Half the people
in the world are women.

282
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:04,225
Why does it have to be you
that stirs me?

283
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,731
- You animal.
G.W: That's the story.

284
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:13,526
l saw your picture in the paper
at the Governor's Ball.

285
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,987
You were dancing
with the governor.

286
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,906
KATE:
At least he's a gentleman.

287
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:19,657
G.W: l doubt that.

288
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:22,785
You have to be a man first
before you're a gentleman.

289
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,829
He misses on both counts.

290
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:48,603
- Hey, sonny, you gonna ask him again?
- Nope.

291
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,774
Hey, boy, you got to pocket your pride.
You got to beg.

292
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,318
You better listen to an expert, sonny.

293
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:59,405
I'm telling you. You got to grovel.
Human nature. Gets 'em every time.

294
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:02,784
Mister, leave me alone.

295
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:07,538
Everybody does it
one way or another.

296
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,530
Heh heh heh!

297
00:21:15,463 --> 00:21:17,215
About that job,
Mr. McLintock.

298
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,635
l already told you, son,
I've got no need for farmers...

299
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,055
- or use for 'em.
- Just one minute, Mr. McLintock.

300
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:28,059
My father died last month.
That's how come we lost our homestead.

301
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:32,480
I've got a mother and a little sister to feed.
I need that job badly.

302
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,066
- What's your name?
- Devlin Warren.

303
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,734
Well, you got a job, son.

304
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,695
See my home ranch foreman.
He's over at the corral.

305
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,190
(Bunny laughs)

306
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,746
Step down off of
that carriage, mister.

307
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:55,878
Hold that hog-legg.

308
00:21:57,713 --> 00:22:02,218
G.W: I've been punched many a time in my life,
but never for hiring anybody.

309
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,097
DEVLlN:
Aw, I don't know what to say.

310
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:10,309
l never begged before.
It turned my stomach.

311
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:14,480
I suppose I should have been
grateful you gave me the job.

312
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:18,234
G.W: "Gave?"
Boy, you got it all wrong.

313
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,946
I don't "give" jobs.
I hire men.

314
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:25,324
You intend to give this man a full day's work,
don't you, boy?

315
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:27,702
DEVLIN: You mean you're still
hiring me, Mr. McLintock?

316
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:31,330
Well, yes, sir. I mean,
I'll certainly deliver a fair day's work.

317
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:34,333
G.W: For that,
I'll pay you a fair day's wage.

318
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,712
You won't "give" me anything,
and I won't "give" you anything.

319
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:40,840
We both hold up our heads.
Where do you live?

320
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:43,134
The settler's encampment
down by the mine.

321
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:46,387
G.W: That your plug?
DEVLIN: Yes, sir.

322
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:49,557
G.W: Well, hop on him,
and we'll go get your gear.

323
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,650
G.W: Ya... Ya!

324
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:23,132
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- G.W: Morning.

325
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:45,029
l am sure that all you
fine people are interested...

326
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:49,492
in knowing just what portion of this new land
will be your new home.

327
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,539
Oh, uh... Jones and McCallister, since you've
been more or less the leaders of our group,

328
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:59,627
I'd like to have you come up
and check the exact location.

329
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:02,922
DEVLIN: Won't be a minute, sir.

330
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,722
Go after that boy
and give him $30.

331
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:15,393
Tell him McLintock pays
his riders a month in advance.

332
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:18,354
DRAGO: From the looks of things
they could sure use it, too.

333
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,526
DEVLIN: Oh, Ma,
this is Mr. Drago.

334
00:24:24,193 --> 00:24:25,403
DRAGO: Good morning.

335
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:30,408
DOUGLAS: Well, and to what do we
owe this visit from the cattle baron?

336
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:34,412
I've got a touch of hangover,
bureaucrat. Don't push me.

337
00:24:35,496 --> 00:24:36,747
RUNNING BUFFALO: Whoa-ho, McLin!

338
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,589
Say, those are Indians.

339
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:47,466
Are there Indians
in this homestead land?

340
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,427
Friendly Indians, my boy.

341
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,140
RUNNING BUFFALO: Whoa-ho, McLin.
G.W: Whoa-ho, Running Buffalo.

342
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:59,019
Ho, McLin. Long time we don't
get drunk together.

343
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:01,730
And it's going to be
a lot longer time...

344
00:25:01,856 --> 00:25:04,442
because it's against the law,
and you're with the sheriff.

345
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:06,152
And have I got my hands full.

346
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:09,697
They came into town to meet the train.
The old Indian chiefs are coming home.

347
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:11,449
l heard they'd been pardoned.

348
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:14,618
SHERlFF: They don't know when it's arriving,
this week, next week, or next month,

349
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:16,996
so, in the meantime, I've got to
do something with them.

350
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:19,665
Could I cut out a couple of head
of your steers to feed them?

351
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,710
Otherwise, some of these settler's
milk cows are going to disappear.

352
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:26,464
- That's right, McLin.
- Ha ha ha! Cut out whatever you need.

353
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,801
Sheriff, are you going to encamp these
savages with all these settlers?

354
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:32,887
You're asking for trouble.

355
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,806
Mr. Douglas, I already have
plenty of trouble.

356
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,558
Please stay off my back.

357
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:40,769
Running Buffalo, bring your
people over to the clay slide.

358
00:25:45,482 --> 00:25:47,151
Hello, Mr. McLin.

359
00:25:47,276 --> 00:25:50,362
Tiny Mouth, it's nice to see you!

360
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:51,822
You wouldn't believe it now,

361
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:55,034
but 20 years ago, she was
a mighty handsome maid.

362
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:59,830
20 years ago, you
thought so, too, Mr. Douglas.

363
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,330
G.W: Ahem.

364
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
DOUGLAS: Ahem.

365
00:26:07,338 --> 00:26:11,217
DRAGO: It was just like this. I had a
dead bead on old Running Buffalo,

366
00:26:11,342 --> 00:26:13,677
and my Sharp .50 caliber misfired.

367
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:16,180
That was back in that trouble
in the forties, remember?

368
00:26:16,305 --> 00:26:17,973
G.W: I remember.

369
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:20,601
You want to taste something
come directly from heaven?

370
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:21,769
No.

371
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:32,237
- Where'd you get this?
- That boy's mama baked 'em.

372
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,615
You thinking the same thing I am?

373
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,744
She's a widow woman, Boss,
and she's got a long, hard road to hoe.

374
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,079
Hire her.

375
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,586
I always said you had
a heap of sense.

376
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,422
Mr. McLintock,
this is my mother.

377
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:55,594
- Your mother?
- And my sister.

378
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:59,932
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. McLintock.
- Ma'am, this here's my boss,

379
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,560
and he has a few choice words
to say about your biscuits.

380
00:27:05,896 --> 00:27:07,606
Yes, Mr. McLintock?

381
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,611
Well... they're great.

382
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:28,460
G.W: Well, you old Cantonese reprobate,
how about it?

383
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:31,255
You fire me,
l kill myself.

384
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:34,925
I'm not talking about firing you.
I'm retiring you.

385
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,970
You been rustling food
for us for 30 years.

386
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,556
We're going to put you
out to pasture.

387
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:43,517
All you'll have to do is give advice,
be one of the family.

388
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:46,895
- l kill myself.
- l may save you the trouble.

389
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,439
Hey, Ching,

390
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:53,986
you kill yourself, I'll cut off your pigtail,
and you ain't never going to get to heaven.

391
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:58,198
- I'll be one of the family?
- l give you my solemn word.

392
00:27:58,323 --> 00:27:59,825
Pretty crummy family...

393
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,037
drink too much, get in fight,
yell all time.

394
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,291
Cut off his pigtail.

395
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:10,210
All right. All right.
I'll be one of the family.

396
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,250
(Speaking Chinese)

397
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,250
I hope everything is satisfactory?

398
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:29,146
This is such a big house, it'll take me
a while to get used to things.

399
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:32,691
Now, please don't hesitate
to tell me if anything is wrong.

400
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:34,526
CHlNG:
No bird's-nest soup?

401
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,990
Otherwise, just fine.
Everything nice and fine.

402
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:41,533
DRAGO: Food's heavenly, ma'am.

403
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,702
CURLY:
Best apple pie l ever ate.

404
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:46,663
G.W: Curly's right, ma'am.
Hated to leave that last bite.

405
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:48,040
Shall we celebrate with a drink?

406
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:50,542
DRAGO: Carlos, come
and help me with the dishes.

407
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,294
Alice, you want to help, too?

408
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:54,796
ALlCE: Yes, Drago.
DRAGO: All right. Pitch in.

409
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:58,425
I'll wash, and you kids can dry.
Is that good?

410
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
LEM: Whoa.

411
00:29:11,146 --> 00:29:15,567
Don't seem possible one woman
could use all them clothes.

412
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:18,278
KATE: You keep a civil tongue
in your unprepossessing face.

413
00:29:18,403 --> 00:29:20,113
LEM: Yes, ma'am.
KATE: And unload my baggage, please.

414
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,448
LEM: Yes, ma'am.

415
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:25,118
By the way, what does that word,
"unprepossessing," mean?

416
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:33,418
- Mrs. McLintock!
- KATE: Oh, hello, Carlos.

417
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:36,505
Run and help the driver
with my luggage.

418
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,717
l couldn't trust anyone else in this house
to do anything correctly.

419
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:46,390
G.W: Luggage? Give him a hand, Curly.
CURLY: Yes, Boss.

420
00:29:46,723 --> 00:29:49,267
- Mr. McLintock.
- Are you moving back in?

421
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:52,938
Yes, but nothing has changed
except my place of residence,

422
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,607
and I'd be willing
to put up with savages...

423
00:29:55,732 --> 00:29:58,276
rather than be denied
the company of my daughter,

424
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:01,113
and I'm proving that
by moving in here.

425
00:30:01,238 --> 00:30:05,575
Mr. McLintock, since it's my first day,
would you excuse me if l, uh...

426
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:09,496
G.W: Go ahead.
Oh, Katherine, this is Dev Warren.

427
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:11,665
He joined the outfit today.

428
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,126
DEV: Pleased, ma'am.
- Thank you.

429
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,590
Well, how refreshing
a polite young man here.

430
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,301
- Where did he come from?
- G.W: He's a farmer.

431
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:25,887
KATE: A farmer?
DRAGO: Well, I'll be doggone!

432
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:27,973
Kate, welcome home.

433
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:31,810
What on earth are you doing
in that idiotic-looking outfit?

434
00:30:32,185 --> 00:30:35,063
- And don't you dare call me "Kate".
- That's my butling suit.

435
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:37,733
I'm butling for the boss.
And I'm sorry, Katherine.

436
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:40,150
That "Kate" kind of slipped out,
from the times l remembered...

437
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,988
you as being nice peop... people.

438
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,580
Oh!

439
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,662
Are you going to stand there
with that stupid look on your face...

440
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:53,457
while the hired help insults your wife?

441
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,709
He's just ignorant.

442
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,044
He doesn't know any better
than to tell the truth.

443
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,172
And I can't help this stupid look.

444
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:04,050
I started acquiring it as you
gained in social prominence.

445
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:07,804
CURLY: Mrs. McLintock, where do
you want I should put...

446
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:10,390
Put them in the master bedroom.

447
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:19,524
Yes, but move Mr. McLintock's
things into another room.

448
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:21,651
Oh, the one back of the stairs
would be best...

449
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:24,196
so that he can't wake up
the entire household...

450
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,114
when he comes home every night...

451
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:29,117
...just before daybreak.
CURLY: Yes, ma'am.

452
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:34,498
MRS. WARREN: Oh, excuse me.

453
00:31:34,915 --> 00:31:38,710
- Here's your cigars, Mr. McLintock.
KATE: I am Mrs. McLintock.

454
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,587
DRAGO: Kate... I mean Katherine...

455
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:43,381
this is the cook, this is the lady
that does the cooking for us.

456
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,967
G.W: Mrs. Warren,
Mrs. McLintock.

457
00:31:46,092 --> 00:31:47,302
KATE: How do you do.

458
00:31:47,427 --> 00:31:49,387
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. McLintock.

459
00:31:49,513 --> 00:31:51,223
- Very pleased.
- Likewise.

460
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:53,340
MRS. WARREN: You see,
I just came to work here today,

461
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,970
and I guess I jumped to the conclusion...

462
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:57,979
that this was a bachelor's household.

463
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,410
(Chuckles)

464
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:02,442
It is, and then again,
it isn't.

465
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:06,738
I will explain so everything will be
quite clear, Mrs. Wallace...

466
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:08,823
EVERYONE: "Mrs. Warren."

467
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:12,452
"Mrs. Warren."

468
00:32:13,286 --> 00:32:17,040
It has been a bachelor's
household for quite some time,

469
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:20,919
and it will be again
just as soon as I'm out of here,

470
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:23,421
which will be as quickly
as I can make arrangements..

471
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:26,132
to take my daughter
back east with me.

472
00:32:26,383 --> 00:32:29,386
You see, she's coming home
from school in a few days,

473
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:33,139
and then we'll be off together,
and you can return to conducting yourself...

474
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:35,767
as you consider proper
in a bachelor's household.

475
00:32:35,892 --> 00:32:37,894
- Katie!
- Shut up!

476
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:41,398
Until then, I am mistress
in this house,

477
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,234
and I will give the orders.

478
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:47,070
(Kate giving orders)

479
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:48,450
- You gonna let her? Ain't you
gonna say nothing, boss?

480
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,250
No!

481
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,616
I want one poached egg, toast...

482
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:54,369
KATE: Oh, G.W., as soon as
my things are put away,

483
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,246
I want to talk to you
about Rebecca.

484
00:32:56,371 --> 00:33:00,750
G.W: Yes, Mrs. McLintock.
Indeed, Mrs. McLintock.

485
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,460
Of course, Mrs. McLintock.

486
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:05,505
The toast... lightly browned
and unbuttered.

487
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:08,383
Of course, ma'am.

488
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,887
Wait a minute now, Boss, where
do you think you're going?

489
00:33:13,013 --> 00:33:14,889
G.W: I just remembered
I got a date.

490
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,808
DRAGO: But she said she want to
have a talk with you.

491
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,226
G.W: I heard.

492
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:26,901
G.W: Good evening, Lem.
LEM: Good evening, Mr. Mac.

493
00:33:30,363 --> 00:33:33,867
Say, Mr. Mac, what does
"unprepossessing" mean?

494
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,039
G.W: I was called that once, Lem.
Looked it up in the dictionary.

495
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:42,333
- It's best you don't know what it means.
LEM: Uh-huh. Thank you. Giddyap.

496
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,472
DRAGO: Hey, what am I going to tell her
when she asks where you went?

497
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:57,849
G.W: When in doubt,
tell the truth.

498
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:00,643
She wouldn't expect that
from you anyway.

499
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:05,982
CURLY: Where's Mr. McLintock going?
DRAGO: There he goes, burning his last bridge.

500
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:08,318
DRAGO: You see a yellow streak
about a foot wide...

501
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:10,361
running up and down
his backbone?

502
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:12,113
On Mr. McLintock?

503
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,650
Uh-huh.

504
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:16,326
- He ain't afraid of nothing.
- I once thought that.

505
00:34:36,387 --> 00:34:38,848
- Drago?
- Yes, ma'am?

506
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:41,768
- Was that, uh...
- He took off. Lit out.

507
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:44,103
- I told him I wanted to talk to him.
- Yes, ma'am.

508
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:46,189
I was standing right over here
when you said it,

509
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:48,483
and I was standing right on
those front steps...

510
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,777
when he walked up to a horse,
grabbed a hunk of mane,

511
00:34:50,902 --> 00:34:53,655
- stepped up on him, and sunk spur.
- Where did he go?

512
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,741
Last time I saw him, he was
going east, but you know him.

513
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:59,744
He's liable to go
north, south, or west.

514
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:01,162
Get me a carriage.

515
00:35:01,287 --> 00:35:03,331
- Yes, ma'am, but...
- But what?

516
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,128
Maybe you shouldn't follow him
into maybe where he's going into.

517
00:35:09,462 --> 00:35:11,589
What does that mean?

518
00:35:11,714 --> 00:35:14,133
I don't know,
but I wish I hadn't-a said it.

519
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:16,678
- Well, just get the carriage.
- Yes, ma'am.

520
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,558
- What happened?
- Get the barouche.

521
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:24,519
- Barouche?
- Hitch it up. She wants to go to town.

522
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,980
But Mr. McLintock never
said anything to me about it.

523
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:29,274
Look, young fella, I'm
the ramrod around this place,

524
00:35:29,983 --> 00:35:33,152
the ramrod around this place, and
you better start giving me a "Yes, sir,"

525
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:36,030
or you're going to get the roof of this house
pulled down on your head.

526
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:37,448
Yes, sir.

527
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,900
(Dance music playing)

528
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,498
G.W: Hello, Davey.
DAVEY: Hi, Mr. McLintock.

529
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:47,917
G.W: New broom, eh?
DAVEY: Sweeps clean.

530
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:54,507
G.W: Hello, Bunny. How is everything?
BUNNY: Oh, fine, fine, Mr. McLintock.

531
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:57,093
I'll get you next time.

532
00:36:08,563 --> 00:36:09,981
Two more, Elmer.

533
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:15,236
Well, look who's here.

534
00:36:16,612 --> 00:36:19,574
What'll it be, Mac?
Same as usual?

535
00:36:20,616 --> 00:36:21,868
Ladies.

536
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:25,079
- Evening, G.W.
- Jake.

537
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,081
JAKE: Wrong move.
G.W: What?

538
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:30,084
JAKE: The chess problem.
Queen's in danger.

539
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,900
(Approaching hoofbeats)

540
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,080
MAN: Whoa. Whoa.

541
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,500
(Indistinct yelling)

542
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:52,065
KATE: I suppose you can do that.

543
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:55,109
G.W: Camille,
you're on your own.

544
00:36:57,528 --> 00:36:59,113
Mrs. McLintock.

545
00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:06,454
I'm Camille...
Camille Reedbottom.

546
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,208
I... I'm, uh, learning
the game of chess.

547
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:15,254
Thought it would give me
something to pass the time.

548
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:18,049
See, I have nothing
to do all day long.

549
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:22,637
I... uh... I just remembered something.

550
00:37:31,187 --> 00:37:33,606
JAKE: Katherine! I didn't
hear you come in.

551
00:37:33,731 --> 00:37:37,735
KATE: Mr. McLintock, I told you
that I wanted to talk to you.

552
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,111
G.W: Not now.

553
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,823
JAKE: Uh, could I get you
a glass of sherry, Katherine?

554
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:44,492
KATE: Oh, thank you,
Mr. Birnbaum. I could use one.

555
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:47,954
I came into town
behind a runaway team!

556
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:51,040
G.W: Drago never
could handle horses.

557
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:54,210
It was that young man whose
mother pretends to be your cook!

558
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:58,047
- Katherine, your wine.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Birnbaum.

559
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,685
Now, Mr. McLintock, we have
an awful lot to talk over.

560
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,231
First thing I learned about Indian fighting
was to wait for daylight.

561
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:18,192
And what does our conversation
got to do with Indian fighting?

562
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:22,363
Indian fighting is good experience
for our kind of conversations.

563
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,730
KATE: Oh!

564
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:24,532
It'll wait, Katherine.

565
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:29,287
DEV: Evening, Sheriff, Mr. McLintock.
We had quite a ride out here.

566
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:33,082
- Oh, I finally got that team settled down.
G.W: It's your move.

567
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:36,544
JAKE: No, it's your move. I just canceled it.
KATE: Now, look here.

568
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:39,380
You're not going to sit here
all night long and play chess...

569
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:41,841
when the matter of our daughter
remains unsettled.

570
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,593
G.W: I am going to
remain here and play chess,

571
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:45,469
and the matter of our daughter
is settled.

572
00:38:45,595 --> 00:38:48,055
- She stays.
KATE: Oh, such stubbornness!

573
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,349
JAKE: Katherine, your hair.

574
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,896
Oh, it must look a mess
after that awful ride.

575
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:59,734
JAKE: No, no. It's just that I haven't
seen you in a long time.

576
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:02,820
It seems to me that the last time I saw you...

577
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:05,448
that your hair was a little darker, no?

578
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,100
- Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.
- (Sarcastically)Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

579
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:14,749
It's a funny thing the tricks
a man's memory will play, uh?

580
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:19,795
Mr. Birnbaum, I think that you've
completely lost your mind.

581
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,758
- You have done something to your hair.
- I have not!

582
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,750
Ha, ha, ha, ah!

583
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:28,262
If I had, it would be
none of your business.

584
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:31,724
I'm certainly not going to put myself in the
place of those blondene trollops

585
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:33,976
that you seem to prefer.

586
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,270
- Take it.
DEVLIN: Oh.

587
00:39:37,772 --> 00:39:39,106
SHERIFF: Fill it.
DEVLIN: Oh.

588
00:39:53,954 --> 00:39:55,122
SHERIFF: Good morning.

589
00:39:57,166 --> 00:40:00,920
- You fellas still at it all night?
JAKE: A McLintock never quits,

590
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:05,508
but a Birnbaum has to.
Besides, the game is over. You got me.

591
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:08,469
Oh, no, Mr. Birnbaum.
You still got a good game.

592
00:40:08,594 --> 00:40:10,513
JAKE: Oh, you play chess?

593
00:40:11,097 --> 00:40:12,765
Please, take over.

594
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,563
- Pretty good?
- Fair.

595
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:24,693
Well, looks like I won't have to come into
town always to get a game.

596
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:28,072
G.W: Remember, I'm a bad loser.

597
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:32,868
G.W: It's your move.
DEVLIN: Yes, sir.

598
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:55,474
Good morning.

599
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,352
Good morning.

600
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:01,939
Is it morning already?

601
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,750
Hmm-mm.

602
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:04,358
Cup of coffee?

603
00:41:05,776 --> 00:41:07,278
Oh, yes. Thanks, Jake.

604
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:11,699
You're welcome, Katherine.

605
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,412
KATE: Got any cream?
JAKE: Canned cow's milk.

606
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:18,080
That'll do.

607
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:21,667
JAKE: Good old condensed milk.

608
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:25,212
That reminds me...

609
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:28,215
I was cleaning out my desk
the other day,

610
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,552
and I found something
I wanted to return to you.

611
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,516
Here it is.

612
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:47,192
It is a medal, do you remember?

613
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:51,405
<i>"From the President of the
United States of America..."</i>

614
00:41:51,822 --> 00:41:54,700
<i>"to First Sergeant
Michael Patrick Gilhooly..."</i>

615
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:58,120
<i>"for bravery above
and beyond the call of duty."</i>

616
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,126
It's your Papa's.

617
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:08,130
Reminds me of the first time
I ever saw you.

618
00:42:08,756 --> 00:42:10,883
It was over 17 years ago.

619
00:42:11,717 --> 00:42:13,510
You walked into my store...

620
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:16,972
not much bigger than
the bundle you were carrying.

621
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:21,143
And in the bundle was the most
beautiful baby I ever saw.

622
00:42:21,977 --> 00:42:23,479
And was she hungry!

623
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:28,150
You walked all the way
from Superstition Creek...

624
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:32,738
just to trade me that medal
for a case of canned milk.

625
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:37,493
G.W. was off somewhere, as usual,

626
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:39,411
fighting Indians.

627
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:44,792
AGARD: Sheriff! Sheriff Lord!

628
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,211
Well, have you
seen the sheriff?

629
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:49,963
SECOND MAN: Kind of early
for him. Did you try his house?

630
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,509
AGARD: Now, why didn't I think of that?
DOUGLAS: Looks like Birnbaum's is open.

631
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:56,136
Maybe somebody
in here knows.

632
00:42:57,888 --> 00:42:59,723
So there you are, Sheriff.

633
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:03,143
I told you you were headed for trouble.

634
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:04,520
SHERIFF: Trouble?

635
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:08,065
AGARD: I want to know by whose authority
you let those Indians stay in town.

636
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,234
Those savages are wards
of the government,

637
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:11,944
and I am the representative
of that government...

638
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:15,697
G.W: I told Sheriff Lord that he could
put them up down by the clay slide.

639
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,201
Because the town's named after
him, he thinks he owns it.

640
00:43:19,326 --> 00:43:21,662
Well, you check the books in
the recorder's office,

641
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:24,540
and you'll find I do
own a fair piece of it.

642
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:27,543
Agard, if you knew anything
about Indians,

643
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,962
you'd know that they're doing
their level best...

644
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:33,507
to put up with our so-called
"benevolent" patronage...

645
00:43:33,632 --> 00:43:37,094
in spite of the nincompoops that
have been put in charge of it.

646
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:40,973
Those Indians need my permission
to leave the reservation.

647
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:44,101
Those chiefs have been giving
orders all their lives.

648
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:45,811
It's pretty hard
for them to understand...

649
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:49,606
that they have to hold up their hand
like a schoolboy in a classroom.

650
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:51,567
AGARD: The law is very clear.

651
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:55,028
I told you you'd get no
satisfaction from these people.

652
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:57,865
- We'll get the girl back.
G.W: Girl?

653
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,909
DOUGLAS: The girl the Indians
kidnapped, but don't worry.

654
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:04,955
I armed the settlers and set them
to rounding up those red devils.

655
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,957
SHERIFF: What is this about a "girl"?

656
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:09,334
Millie Jones... one of
the settler's daughters.

657
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:11,795
- The Indians kidnapped her.
SHERIFF: That's ridiculous

658
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,381
SHERIFF: And you turned loose a lot of
farmers with shotguns?

659
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:18,135
DOUGLAS: I certainly did.
G.W: You're insane. Let's go, Sheriff.

660
00:44:19,845 --> 00:44:22,639
KATE: Mr. Douglas.
DOUGLAS: Oh, Mrs. McLintock.

661
00:44:22,764 --> 00:44:25,851
KATE: Much as I hate to agree
with G.W. about anything,

662
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:29,813
you haven't changed a bit.
You're still an hysterical fool.

663
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:37,404
DRAGO: Come into town. I got worried.
G.W: What about?

664
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:41,700
DRAGO: Thought maybe Katie shot you.
KATE: Not yet, Drago, but it took restraint.

665
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:45,203
SHERIFF: Wait a minute. You better take Agard along,

666
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:48,790
not that he'll be much help.
G.W: Drago, help him on the horse.

667
00:44:53,962 --> 00:44:55,464
AGARD: Just a minute.

668
00:45:00,093 --> 00:45:02,012
KATE: I'll drive.
DEV: Yes, ma'am.

669
00:45:03,555 --> 00:45:06,016
G.W: Agard, what are you doing?
DRAGO: Snatch him, Agard!

670
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:07,450
DOUGLAS: Agard,
this is serious.

671
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,520
DRAGO: Stay with him, Agard.
Stay with him.

672
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,817
Agard, will you stop showing off
and get in this buggy!

673
00:45:16,234 --> 00:45:17,361
Mercy.

674
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:20,864
Mercy.

675
00:45:21,198 --> 00:45:23,367
DRAGO:
That horse is a little green.

676
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:31,840
G.W: Let's go.
Ya!

677
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:41,134
G.W: Just where
do you think you're going?

678
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:44,596
KATE: Don't use that range boss
tone of voice with me!

679
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,430
(Cattle lowing)

680
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,190
G.W: Carter!

681
00:45:56,066 --> 00:45:58,235
We're headed
for Mr. Poorboy's mine.

682
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:00,779
Mount up some riders.

683
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:04,074
Right, Boss.
You heard the man!

684
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:12,499
DAVEY: I don't like it, Mr. McLintock.
I don't like it one bit.

685
00:46:12,624 --> 00:46:16,002
G.W: What don't you like?
DAVEY: They're planning to hang an Indian!

686
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,236
Oh ho, Sheriff very funny.
Where's the whiskey?

687
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:43,071
Ha ha!

688
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:44,322
G.W: Hold it!

689
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:48,535
Not so fast,
Mr. Boss of the Whole Country,

690
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,538
unless you want to wear
a big hole in your middle.

691
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:56,084
How long is G.W. going to let
that cheechako push him around?

692
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:58,879
That cheechako
has a sawed-off shotgun.

693
00:46:59,629 --> 00:47:01,840
How do you know she didn't
wander off someplace,

694
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:04,092
- or meet some fella, or something?
- What are you saying?

695
00:47:04,217 --> 00:47:05,969
That I didn't raise my girl right?

696
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:08,138
That she'd wander off
all night with some man?

697
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:10,765
There's a lot of things
I'm not saying to you, mister,

698
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:13,351
while you got a sawed-off
shotgun in my middle.

699
00:47:13,476 --> 00:47:16,062
But how do you know this Indian
had anything to do with it?

700
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:18,648
She's gone, ain't she?
She's gone!

701
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:22,319
MILLIE: Pa!
Pa, I'm over here!

702
00:47:22,694 --> 00:47:23,945
Pa!

703
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,951
- Been looking for me, Pa?
- Where you been, gal?

704
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:35,206
Young Ben took me for a sunrise ride,
and the horse wandered away.

705
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,640
(Everyone laughing)

706
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:39,294
- You come down off of there!
- But, Pa!

707
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:42,339
She's telling the truth, Mr. McLintock.
We wasn't doing nothing.

708
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:43,715
Well, that's not important right now.

709
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,092
The important thing is that
you don't draw that hog-legg,

710
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:48,595
or this'll be worse than
Dodge City on Saturday night.

711
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,349
You get on back to the wagon!
I'll tend to you later.

712
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:56,686
- Now for this young whippersnapper!
- Now, no harm has been done,

713
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:59,814
and Young Ben here is one of the
nicest boys in the territory.

714
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,860
So just put down that shotgun,
and let's forget it.

715
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,860
I'll teach him to fool with my...

716
00:48:05,278 --> 00:48:08,281
Now...
we'll all calm down.

717
00:48:08,406 --> 00:48:11,201
- Boss, he's just a little excited.
- I know, I know.

718
00:48:11,326 --> 00:48:14,913
I'm going to use good judgment.
I haven't lost my temper in 40 years.

719
00:48:15,038 --> 00:48:17,582
But, pilgrim, you caused
a lot of trouble this morning.

720
00:48:17,707 --> 00:48:19,084
Might have got somebody killed.

721
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:21,120
And somebody ought
to belt you in the mouth!

722
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,120
But I won't.
I won't...

723
00:48:24,631 --> 00:48:26,257
The hell I won't!

724
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,050
Oomf!

725
00:48:32,472 --> 00:48:34,599
McLintock rider!

726
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,520
MEN: Yee-ha!

727
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,100
RUNNING BUFFALO: Ha haa!

728
00:48:45,193 --> 00:48:46,444
Oh, McLin!

729
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:50,490
Hey, Buster...
remember me?

730
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,890
Aah!

731
00:48:57,997 --> 00:49:00,500
Well, sir... nice party.

732
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,470
- Do you think you ought to?
- I "ought to" what?

733
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:21,479
Why, you big...

734
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,470
MAN: Yeeow!

735
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,470
SECOND MAN: Aaah!

736
00:49:45,879 --> 00:49:47,714
Good morning, good party!
Great party!

737
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,830
AGARD: Hey! Wait! I want a word with you.
Hey, just a minute! What... what are you...

738
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,700
My glasses!

739
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,012
Hey, now, stop this,
or you'll be sorry!

740
00:49:56,848 --> 00:50:00,143
Oh, for heaven's sake!

741
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:07,233
G.W: Stay out of this, Jake.
JAKE: It's everybody's war!

742
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,230
Aah!

743
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,230
Run, Old Paint!

744
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,270
Where's the whiskey?

745
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,140
RUNNING BUFFALO:
Where's the whiskey?

746
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,140
Good fight, good fight!

747
00:50:51,736 --> 00:50:53,905
RUNNING BUFFALO: Ha, ha, ha!
- Oh, sorry, McLintock.

748
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,745
- Oh ho, McLin!.
- Thanks

749
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:09,754
- Ha ha! Very funny!
- Yeah. Very funny.

750
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,750
MAN: Ohhh!

751
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:25,520
Gosh, Mr. Douglas,
I'm sorry!

752
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,520
Ha! Ha! Ha!

753
00:51:29,983 --> 00:51:32,810
Bon voyage, Drago! Aahhhh!

754
00:51:50,169 --> 00:51:52,088
Are you still down here?

755
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,508
Hey! Horse wandered away, huh?

756
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:57,635
Honest, Mr. Jones.
Honest...

757
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:04,517
Oh... get out of my way!

758
00:52:08,438 --> 00:52:10,398
- Nice left.
- Thanks!

759
00:52:12,108 --> 00:52:15,194
- I went to college!
- For this, you don't need college!

760
00:52:16,404 --> 00:52:18,448
You're not
getting me down there!

761
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,440
MAN: Ohhh!

762
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,440
Owwww!

763
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,550
You beast!
You did this on purpose!

764
00:52:39,844 --> 00:52:42,054
Why, McLintock, you big...

765
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,266
Good morning to you, Mrs. McLintock.
Bunny, you big... oaf!

766
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,260
G.W: Yeeoowie!

767
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,260
(Kate screams)

768
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:50,813
G.W: Oh, No!

769
00:52:54,442 --> 00:52:57,862
G.W. McLintock, you big...
great big clumsy...

770
00:52:58,279 --> 00:53:01,040
G.W: Well, it's pretty
hard to control yourself... Ohhh...

771
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:03,320
DRAGO: People, people, people!

772
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,084
RUNNING BUFFALO: Oh, McLin!

773
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:18,216
Oh, McLin, good party! But no whiskey.
We go home.

774
00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:30,811
- You and your friends!
- Well, we at least saved your hat.

775
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:31,810
Oh!

776
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:38,986
Where is everybody?

777
00:53:40,238 --> 00:53:41,822
Oh, for heaven's sakes!

778
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,230
DRAGO: Whoa! Whoa!

779
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,086
KATE: Drago, will you never
learn how to handle a team?

780
00:53:55,211 --> 00:53:58,297
DRAGO: Yes, ma'am, I'll sure try.
I'll tell you that, now.

781
00:53:59,632 --> 00:54:02,635
CHING: Crummy family!
DRAGO: You want to lose your pigtail?

782
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,136
CHING: I lose face!

783
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,640
- Lousy leathertips!
DRAGO: You'll lose more than that!

784
00:54:08,015 --> 00:54:09,517
- Kate.
- Yes?

785
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:13,813
We could be a big help
to one another.

786
00:54:14,063 --> 00:54:16,107
KATE: Like what, may I ask?

787
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:19,235
Well, we could wash the mud
off of each other.

788
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,822
We used to have quite good times
doing that sort of thing.

789
00:54:23,698 --> 00:54:28,369
There are a lot of things  we used to do.
Good night, Mr. McLintock!

790
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:40,172
- Any luck?
- What are you talking about?

791
00:54:40,297 --> 00:54:44,176
- I mean divorce! She still want it?
- Yeah.

792
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:45,928
You know something,
women are funny.

793
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:48,764
She fought like a wildcat on your side
out there this afternoon.

794
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:51,142
Come home... she slams
the door in your face.

795
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:52,393
That divorce business...

796
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:56,230
is that what you get when you pay
a woman not to live with you?

797
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:57,732
That's about it.

798
00:54:57,857 --> 00:55:00,651
Some women I've knowed,
it'd be worth it.

799
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:03,404
You know, if we had
any moral character,

800
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:06,282
we wouldn't be standing here,
covered with mud, drinking...

801
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:09,285
- when we should be washing.
- G.W.

802
00:55:10,536 --> 00:55:11,704
Drago.

803
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:18,711
Mrs. Warren,
these biscuits... mmmm!

804
00:55:19,462 --> 00:55:21,046
Why, thank you, Drago.

805
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:28,637
- Good morning, Mrs. Warren.
- Good morning, Mr. McLintock.

806
00:55:28,763 --> 00:55:30,347
Breakfast for the Boss?

807
00:55:30,473 --> 00:55:33,392
If that's the way you want it, Mr. McLintock.

808
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:18,479
One poached egg, tea,
toast, lightly browned and un...

809
00:56:19,563 --> 00:56:23,317
Why, Mrs. McLintock...
you have a black eye!

810
00:56:23,442 --> 00:56:24,610
I do? Oooh!

811
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:34,203
- Oh! Ohh... and Becky's coming home today.
MRS. WARREN: And that's not all..

812
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:37,289
There's a little something
we'd better get settled.

813
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:37,800
KATE: Hmm?

814
00:56:37,831 --> 00:56:41,085
There are no men listening now,
so we can be ourselves.

815
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,338
Oh, sure, I let you get away
with all that guff the other night,...

816
00:56:44,463 --> 00:56:46,257
but now that we're alone...

817
00:56:46,382 --> 00:56:50,344
When I want the opinion of
the hired help, I'll ask for it.

818
00:56:50,886 --> 00:56:53,764
You know, you could wind up
with two black eyes.

819
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,050
What?

820
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,352
Oh... I realize you had
to put on that big act.

821
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:02,189
We always have to, just before
we get ready to forgive them...

822
00:57:02,314 --> 00:57:05,067
generally for something
they haven't done.

823
00:57:05,484 --> 00:57:08,280
But you and I both know, that's just to
keep them from getting the idea

824
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,073
they, uh... run things.

825
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:14,368
- McLintock give you that black eye?
- No!

826
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,705
Nobody gave it to me.
I won it.

827
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,170
(Train whistle)

828
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:29,091
MAN: Morning, Davey.
- Morning, Mrs. Beech. Mr. Beech.

829
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:42,090
(Train whistle)

830
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:48,090
(Bell clanging)

831
00:57:54,090 --> 00:58:00,090
(Band playing)

832
00:58:25,731 --> 00:58:28,650
- Why, Miss Becky, welcome home!
- Mr. Douglas!

833
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,500
JUNIOR: Hi, Dad!

834
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:32,070
DOUGLAS: My boy! Ha ha ha!
JUNIOR: It's good to see you again!

835
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:33,530
Daddy!

836
00:58:33,906 --> 00:58:35,690
Daddy! Oh!

837
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,329
It's been two long years!

838
00:58:40,454 --> 00:58:43,290
I guess I'm going to have to
stop calling you "tomboy"!

839
00:58:43,415 --> 00:58:45,417
- Becky.
- Mama!

840
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:49,505
- Oh, Mama! I wasn't sure you'd be here.
- Oh, I've been here a few days.

841
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,841
Oh, Becky, I've bought you three
of the most beautiful dresses!

842
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:53,500
DRAGO: Becky!

843
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:54,968
Uncle Drago!
Ohh!

844
00:58:56,386 --> 00:58:58,722
Did you bring your old uncle
a coming-home present?

845
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:00,557
- Sure did!
- What is it?

846
00:59:00,682 --> 00:59:03,060
A mustache cup!
And what did you get me?

847
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:06,271
Prettiest palomino pony that
ever packed a saddle.

848
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:09,107
Broke to stand ground-tied
in the county.

849
00:59:09,107 --> 00:59:10,901
(Jake plays tuba)

850
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:12,236
Uncle Jake! Ohh!

851
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,573
What are you doing
with Mr. Douglas' tuba?

852
00:59:16,698 --> 00:59:18,575
Oh, Mr. Douglas has a fat...

853
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,410
had a little accident.

854
00:59:22,788 --> 00:59:25,541
You know, I brought you a whole
shipment of licorice sticks!

855
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,501
But now that I've seen
how much you've grown,

856
00:59:27,626 --> 00:59:30,963
I think we better exchange them for a
couple of bolts of dress goods, huh?

857
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:34,174
- Thank you!
- Oh, the mayor was going to be here,

858
00:59:34,299 --> 00:59:37,094
but he had to go to the territorial capital
on a horse theft matter.

859
00:59:37,219 --> 00:59:39,346
But I'm going to give his speech.

860
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,340
(Crowd cheering)

861
00:59:42,766 --> 00:59:44,643
Oh, and don't worry about the mayor.

862
00:59:44,768 --> 00:59:47,896
I'm sure that he can find
the bill of sale for the horse.

863
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,890
(Crowd laughing)

864
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:57,322
"Ladies and gentlemen,
we are here to welcome the fairest..."

865
00:59:58,991 --> 01:00:00,742
What am I doing?

866
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,497
We are here to welcome back...

867
01:00:05,872 --> 01:00:08,959
the prettiest girl
that was ever born in McLintock,

868
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:11,378
or in any part of the territory.

869
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,710
Now, this...

870
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,740
(Steam hissing)

871
01:00:17,843 --> 01:00:19,428
MAN: Hey, Davey!
- Yeah?

872
01:00:19,553 --> 01:00:21,346
Got something for you!

873
01:00:23,515 --> 01:00:24,975
Yard manager up at the junction...

874
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,811
told me to let them ride,
so I locked them in here.

875
01:00:27,936 --> 01:00:30,397
I've had my scalp
a long time,

876
01:00:31,106 --> 01:00:32,941
and I aim to keep it!

877
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,940
(Speaking Comanche)
<i>Yatahe.</i>

878
01:00:55,464 --> 01:00:59,301
And now she's come back to us.
Gone are the pigtails....

879
01:00:59,426 --> 01:01:03,889
But the freckles are still on the prettiest face
that was ever born in McLintock.

880
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,380
(Indians chanting)

881
01:01:14,316 --> 01:01:15,650
Hey, that's Puma.

882
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:20,697
Then it's true. The government
did turn them loose.

883
01:01:20,822 --> 01:01:22,449
Good old Puma.

884
01:01:22,991 --> 01:01:26,661
I'll never forget
when he brought G.W. home.

885
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:31,750
Your father had a hole
in his chest and a 104 fever.

886
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:34,503
Of course, they weren't
very mannerly about it.

887
01:01:34,628 --> 01:01:39,466
He came past the house at a high lope
and threw him on the doorstep.

888
01:01:40,008 --> 01:01:43,720
Then you do remember them
good old days, don't you, Katie?

889
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,058
"Katherine."

890
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,050
(Chanting continues)

891
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,050
(Chanting stops)

892
01:02:06,201 --> 01:02:09,037
- <i>Yatahe,</i> my friends.
- <i>Yatahe.</i>

893
01:02:09,287 --> 01:02:11,206
G.W: Puma, honored enemy.

894
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:16,002
Does Big McLintock forget,
also blood brothers?

895
01:02:16,211 --> 01:02:18,296
No, I'll never forget that.

896
01:02:18,421 --> 01:02:20,799
Old wound...
does it hurt still?

897
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:23,426
I feel it when it comes on to rain.

898
01:02:23,552 --> 01:02:25,929
An inch higher, and I wouldn't
have had to worry.

899
01:02:26,054 --> 01:02:29,057
Aw, Big McLintock,
that was remembered fight.

900
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:34,104
We return with news.
Our people have more trouble.

901
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:38,942
You see, I learn good English
now, Big McLintock.

902
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:41,444
Learned in white man's jail.

903
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:45,031
But we would have you talk
our cause at government hearing.

904
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:50,829
I understand that Governor Humphreys
is going to preside at that meeting.

905
01:02:53,081 --> 01:02:55,625
Yes, Puma,
I'll translate your wishes.

906
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,460
AGARD: Mr. McLintock, uh...

907
01:02:57,627 --> 01:03:01,339
could I impose upon you to use your
Comanche to tell these chiefs that...

908
01:03:01,464 --> 01:03:05,343
Puma is chief of the Comanches,
and he speaks English very well.

909
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,040
Ah, well...

910
01:03:07,512 --> 01:03:10,640
Your people will have to follow
my instructions to the letter.

911
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:11,975
- It is the law of the land...
- We go.

912
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:15,729
Well, now, just a minute...

913
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,525
Well, for heaven's sakes!

914
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,919
You wait here, honey.
I'll get the buggy.

915
01:03:41,546 --> 01:03:44,007
- Are you going to the McLintock party?
- Surely.

916
01:03:44,132 --> 01:03:45,592
Will I see you there, Beth?

917
01:03:45,717 --> 01:03:47,886
Of course, Davey, and you
can have the first dance.

918
01:03:48,011 --> 01:03:49,095
Sis! Come on.

919
01:03:50,805 --> 01:03:53,391
I don't want any sister of mine
talking to strangers.

920
01:03:53,516 --> 01:03:56,353
Davey's not a stranger.
He clerks in Birnbaum's.

921
01:03:59,773 --> 01:04:01,149
He's an Indian.

922
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:09,657
DEV: Darn you, Drago!

923
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:14,245
Now look what you've done.

924
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:17,499
Baby, this is Devlin Warren.
He works for your papa.

925
01:04:17,624 --> 01:04:20,043
Dev, this is
Miss Becky McLintock.

926
01:04:20,168 --> 01:04:21,628
BECKY: Those are my things.

927
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:23,379
Yes, ma'am.

928
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:25,882
Aw, I'd have known you
anywhere, Miss Becky.

929
01:04:26,007 --> 01:04:27,509
What do you mean?

930
01:04:28,968 --> 01:04:32,013
Oh! I mean, you look so much like
your mother. Well, even prettier!

931
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:36,101
Well, Mr. Warren,
Mother's much prettier than I am.

932
01:04:36,226 --> 01:04:39,479
Many a fight's started with words like that.
Come on, get in the buggy.

933
01:04:39,604 --> 01:04:40,730
BECKY: Hello, Ching!

934
01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:44,109
- We got jelly pie for dinner?
CHING: I'm not cooking!

935
01:04:44,234 --> 01:04:45,652
No, he's not.

936
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:48,029
BECKY: Junior!
- Yes, Miss Becky!

937
01:04:48,154 --> 01:04:51,866
- You remember Junior Douglas, Mama.
- Oh, of course. How's college?

938
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:54,869
- Valedictorian. 95.
KATE: Oh, congratulations!

939
01:04:54,994 --> 01:04:57,789
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas,
we will see you at the party, of course?

940
01:04:57,914 --> 01:04:59,499
Oh, delighted!

941
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:02,330
Well, it'll be pretty hard
to keep young Matt away.

942
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:02,960
Yes, sir!

943
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:05,505
G.W: Drago!
DRAGO: Yes, Boss, baggage all loaded.

944
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,591
KATE: G.W.!
You remember young Junior?

945
01:05:09,717 --> 01:05:12,220
Oh, yes.
Like father, like son.

946
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:16,349
JUNIOR: Oh, uh, Mr. McLintock, uh, I hope
you don't think I'm being presumptuous

947
01:05:16,474 --> 01:05:19,435
in asking for the honor
of calling on Miss Rebecca.

948
01:05:20,395 --> 01:05:23,731
- Well, there she is. Ask her yourself.
- Well, thank you, sir!

949
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:26,609
Ching, now I'm gonna get fired.
Giddyap out of here!

950
01:05:26,734 --> 01:05:28,444
JUNIOR: Thank you, sir.
Thank you!

951
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:35,159
KATE: Have you no manners?
BECKY: See you at the party, Junior!

952
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:38,329
G.W: Yeah. Yeap.
DOUGLAS: Yeah what?

953
01:05:38,496 --> 01:05:40,415
G.W: Like father,
like son.

954
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,544
What did he mean, Matthew?

955
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:50,383
DRAGO: Come on, Ching,
grab a root and growl.

956
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,110
(Ching speaking Chinese)

957
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,810
(Cow moos)

958
01:05:58,516 --> 01:06:01,019
MRS. WARREN: Well, you're doing
a good job, Miss McLintock.

959
01:06:01,144 --> 01:06:02,687
BECKY: Thank you, Mrs. Warren.

960
01:06:02,812 --> 01:06:06,899
MRS. WARREN: Dev, when you're finished there,
go over and help Drago with the beer kegs.

961
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:08,276
Yes, Mom.

962
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:13,781
Uh, Dev... could you come
and help me a minute?

963
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:22,415
I certainly was surprised
to hear you went to college.

964
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,751
DEVLIN: Why?
BECKY: I don't know.

965
01:06:25,376 --> 01:06:29,255
Junior says Purdue's a good college
for a backwater place like Indiana.

966
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,590
Well, he did, indeed.

967
01:06:30,715 --> 01:06:32,884
Oh, could you do this?
I can't reach it.

968
01:06:34,927 --> 01:06:38,014
- Why didn't you finish college?
- Lack of funds.

969
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:40,767
My father got sick,
and he had to come out west.

970
01:06:41,225 --> 01:06:43,311
So he took out a homestead.

971
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,816
BECKY: You know, your mom's sure cute.
It's, uh, too bad you didn't inherit her eyes.

972
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:57,617
Well, you'd been lucky, if you'd inherited
a few things from your father.

973
01:06:58,368 --> 01:07:01,037
Oh, really?
For instance?

974
01:07:02,372 --> 01:07:05,166
- His common sense, for instance.
- Common sense?

975
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:09,462
Yeah. You don't see him being fooled
by some dude like Junior Douglas.

976
01:07:09,587 --> 01:07:12,840
Junior's not a dude! He's nifty.

977
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:15,551
This needs a woman's touch.

978
01:07:15,676 --> 01:07:19,931
- And besides, he got a letter at college.
- What sport?

979
01:07:20,306 --> 01:07:23,184
- Glee club.
DEV: Very strenuous.

980
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,920
Hmmph! Oooh!

981
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,440
Oh! Don't you dare hug me!

982
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,700
DEV: I have no intention
of hugging you.

983
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,400
Oooh!

984
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,560
(Music playing)

985
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,619
BEN: Ladies all look
lovely, Katherine.

986
01:08:24,453 --> 01:08:26,080
You know, this is a real fine party.

987
01:08:26,205 --> 01:08:29,750
Oh, thank you, Ben. Of course, we had
to invite everybody.

988
01:08:30,376 --> 01:08:32,336
Just everybody.

989
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,591
MAN: Sorry, G.W.,
this one's mine.

990
01:08:37,383 --> 01:08:41,262
Well, thank you, Mrs. Warren. I guess I'll have
to be a good host in my own home.

991
01:08:41,387 --> 01:08:44,515
- Well, the next one's yours, Mr. McLintock.
- Thank you.

992
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:15,713
- Drago, go and do what I told you to do.
- Oh, Katie!

993
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:18,007
"Katherine!"
And do as you're told!

994
01:09:18,132 --> 01:09:21,135
"Ohh, Drago do this,
Drago do that!"

995
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,642
DRAGO: Yee-ha!
People, people, people!

996
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,311
- This Douglas feller...
- KATE: Drago!

997
01:09:30,978 --> 01:09:32,229
DRAGO: Yes, ma'am.

998
01:09:32,355 --> 01:09:34,523
Matt Douglas, junior...

999
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:38,653
is going to bring you folks some of the
latest terpsichorean dance steps...

1000
01:09:38,778 --> 01:09:42,490
brand-new, brought by him
directly from New York City.

1001
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,490
(Squeals and applause)

1002
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:47,078
All right, Mr. Fiddler.

1003
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:32,164
Give me a whiskey!

1004
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:33,791
(Ching speaking Chinese)

1005
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:36,335
- What?
- This turn a ten-gallon party, boss.

1006
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:39,880
- We are run out of whiskey.
- Well, I can take care of that, Ching.

1007
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,880
(Ching speaking Chinese)

1008
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:58,899
YOUNG BEN: Indian!

1009
01:11:03,612 --> 01:11:06,824
And you still got any ideas
about asking my sister to dance,

1010
01:11:06,949 --> 01:11:09,160
get up, and we can do this
all over again.

1011
01:11:09,285 --> 01:11:10,452
DAVEY: Yes!

1012
01:11:10,578 --> 01:11:14,206
JAKE: That's enough! You fought it! It's all over!
YOUNG BEN: Quit butting in, Birnbaum!

1013
01:11:14,331 --> 01:11:17,877
- He's a hired man, not your son!
JAKE: Look, you fought him fair and square!

1014
01:11:18,002 --> 01:11:20,421
DEV: I don't think
it was so fair and square.

1015
01:11:21,422 --> 01:11:23,507
Well, you want to take up
where he left off?

1016
01:11:23,632 --> 01:11:26,635
If I did, you wouldn't
find it so easy.

1017
01:11:30,514 --> 01:11:32,057
JAKE: Now, we've had
enough of this!

1018
01:11:32,183 --> 01:11:34,018
YOUNG BEN: When are you going
to quit walking away?

1019
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,270
DEV: Just as soon as we're
out of sight of the party.

1020
01:11:36,395 --> 01:11:38,814
A little lesson I learned back home:
"Don't fight in front of women."

1021
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:41,400
YOUNG BEN: Well, we're out of sight now.
DEV: So we are.

1022
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:02,922
Such vulgarity.
Someone should do something about it.

1023
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:05,090
You're right.

1024
01:12:06,383 --> 01:12:07,968
Absolutely right.

1025
01:12:37,998 --> 01:12:39,833
You all right, Young Ben?

1026
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,253
I'm all right,
Mr. McLintock.

1027
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,881
Pretty fancy fighting
for a country boy.

1028
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:49,843
Two years at Purdue, Mr. McLintock,
on the boxing team.

1029
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:53,138
YOUNG BEN: I never thought
any farmer could whip me,

1030
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,100
but you sure did.

1031
01:12:56,225 --> 01:12:59,186
Better get him cleaned up.
Get him some water, Jake.

1032
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:00,480
JAKE: Yeap.

1033
01:13:18,247 --> 01:13:22,209
Well, get yourself cleaned up.
Go ask that girl for a dance.

1034
01:13:22,584 --> 01:13:23,669
DEV: Who?

1035
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:28,924
Oh!

1036
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,420
Did I miss one?

1037
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:34,471
FAUNTLEROY: Where is he? I'll find him,
that young whippersnapper!

1038
01:13:34,596 --> 01:13:35,639
G.W: Trouble.

1039
01:13:35,764 --> 01:13:37,641
FAUNTLEROY: Where is
that farmer boy? Where is he?

1040
01:13:37,766 --> 01:13:39,309
Where is he, G.W.?

1041
01:13:40,602 --> 01:13:44,231
Oh, so you're the young farmer boy,
that whipped my nephew!

1042
01:13:44,481 --> 01:13:46,984
Well, I'm Fauntleroy Sage,
Young Ben's uncle.

1043
01:13:47,109 --> 01:13:49,570
Well, I'm no farmer,
but if you're Young Ben's uncle,

1044
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:52,406
yes, I whipped him,
and you're intruding.

1045
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:55,200
- What's "intruding" mean?
- Butting in.

1046
01:13:55,325 --> 01:13:57,536
Oh, so he's insulting me!

1047
01:13:57,661 --> 01:13:59,913
Well, then I got another
reason for walloping him,

1048
01:14:00,038 --> 01:14:02,583
besides on account of him
thrashing my nephew Young Ben.

1049
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:06,170
Fauntleroy, you can't get mixed
up in these youngsters' quarrel.

1050
01:14:06,295 --> 01:14:07,504
Family honor.

1051
01:14:07,629 --> 01:14:10,090
I can't have it said
a farmer whipped a Sage!

1052
01:14:10,215 --> 01:14:11,842
You're twice his size.

1053
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:14,636
Don't let that
bother you, Mr. McLintock.

1054
01:14:14,761 --> 01:14:18,599
If Mr. Fauntleroy insists, I'll just have to
teach him the same lesson.

1055
01:14:31,528 --> 01:14:32,654
Say!

1056
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:40,621
FAUNTLEROY:
Sorry, young feller.

1057
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,990
(Men laughing)

1058
01:14:43,415 --> 01:14:46,376
FAUNTLEROY: Hate to have to do that,
young fella. No hard feelings.

1059
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:47,711
DEV: Not yet.

1060
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:51,548
G.W: Not yet, what?
DEV: I mean, that isn't all.

1061
01:14:51,673 --> 01:14:53,091
G.W: Now, wait a minute.

1062
01:14:54,384 --> 01:14:57,387
Fauntleroy, we're gonna
make this a fair fight.

1063
01:14:58,013 --> 01:15:01,600
Course we are. Course we are, G.W.
There'll be none of this.

1064
01:15:02,351 --> 01:15:04,478
I wouldn't do that, G.W.

1065
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:07,648
- You wouldn't do...
FAUNTLEROY: Nooo, I wouldn't do that!

1066
01:15:07,773 --> 01:15:11,401
And, Dev, I don't want you kicking
Fauntleroy in the knee.

1067
01:15:11,526 --> 01:15:13,445
He didn't do no such thing!

1068
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,697
And none of this nose-twisting.

1069
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:17,190
(Fauntleroy screaming)

1070
01:15:17,491 --> 01:15:19,076
He's all yours.

1071
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:30,545
AGARD: Where are my glasses?

1072
01:15:30,671 --> 01:15:32,506
You all right, young feller?

1073
01:15:33,215 --> 01:15:37,010
Ouch! I'm all right, if this Indian agent
will stop stepping all over me.

1074
01:15:37,135 --> 01:15:40,263
G.W, you was just funning me,

1075
01:15:40,389 --> 01:15:43,934
but I want you to know that boy
fought me a fair fight.

1076
01:15:44,059 --> 01:15:46,144
Well, I'm glad to hear that, Fauntleroy.

1077
01:15:46,269 --> 01:15:47,688
YOUNG BEN: Where's my uncle?

1078
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:51,066
Fauntleroy, what have you been doing?

1079
01:15:51,191 --> 01:15:54,361
- I hope my uncle didn't bother anybody.
DEV: No bother.

1080
01:15:54,486 --> 01:15:58,573
G.W: I think we'd better join the ladies,
before they get curious. Drago!

1081
01:15:59,032 --> 01:16:01,910
DRAGO: Fauntleroy, let's
line them all up for a do-si-do.

1082
01:16:02,244 --> 01:16:03,370
Jake.

1083
01:16:04,162 --> 01:16:06,707
you think tincture of arnica would help?

1084
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:10,335
JAKE: Could be.
Used to help you.

1085
01:16:12,421 --> 01:16:14,798
Gentlemen,
to the medicine cabinet.

1086
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,945
- Good morning, Drago.
- Morning, Becky.

1087
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:38,155
You seen Daddy?

1088
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,615
Took off early this morning with
a scatter gun over his arm.

1089
01:16:40,741 --> 01:16:41,908
Went hunting.

1090
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:42,900
Oh.

1091
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,400
(Gunshot)

1092
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,200
(Horse neighs)

1093
01:17:09,519 --> 01:17:11,855
- Morning, Daddy.
- Good afternoon.

1094
01:17:12,481 --> 01:17:14,608
What gets you out so early?

1095
01:17:14,816 --> 01:17:16,985
It's something I have
to get straight in my mind.

1096
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,195
G.W: Yeah?

1097
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:20,947
What?

1098
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,550
Mama.

1099
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:33,376
Why did you and Mama
stop living together, Daddy?

1100
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,547
Why did you separate?

1101
01:17:39,174 --> 01:17:41,176
- Aren't you going to answer me?
- G.W: Nope.

1102
01:17:42,302 --> 01:17:45,388
- It's sort of my business, I think..
- I don't.

1103
01:17:47,224 --> 01:17:49,893
Is it another woman?
Usually is.

1104
01:17:51,102 --> 01:17:53,688
At your age,
you always know what's usual.

1105
01:17:53,813 --> 01:17:55,315
It's Mrs. Warren!

1106
01:17:56,942 --> 01:18:01,279
Becky, I don't want to start laying the
law down your first day back home,

1107
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:04,157
but I'll have no more such talk.

1108
01:18:04,282 --> 01:18:07,369
The first time I ever saw
Mrs. Warren was last week.

1109
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:09,955
She has a job here
at which she's very good,

1110
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:12,540
and I hope you'll have
the good manners...

1111
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:15,168
to not pry into
other people's business...

1112
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,800
(Gunshot)

1113
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:19,798
Your mother's and mine.

1114
01:18:20,674 --> 01:18:22,467
Pretty good shot, Daddy.

1115
01:18:23,426 --> 01:18:25,178
Oh, I can understand your trouble.

1116
01:18:25,303 --> 01:18:28,640
Mama's often so, well,
so petulant.

1117
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:30,475
Petulant?

1118
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:33,311
You learned a lot of words
back east, Becky.

1119
01:18:33,436 --> 01:18:35,897
I wished to God they would have
taught you some meanings.

1120
01:18:36,022 --> 01:18:38,566
You were only
about six months old

1121
01:18:38,858 --> 01:18:43,154
when your mother stayed alone with you in a
sod hut under eight foot of snow...

1122
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:47,784
while I moved the herd 300 miles
south to try and save it.

1123
01:18:48,076 --> 01:18:49,911
Saved about half of it.

1124
01:18:50,036 --> 01:18:54,249
You were a little more than a year old
at the time of the great Comanche raids.

1125
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:58,712
We stood off 500
Plains Indians for nine days.

1126
01:18:59,546 --> 01:19:01,006
Petulant, Becky?

1127
01:19:01,965 --> 01:19:04,009
I think you better go on home.

1128
01:19:04,134 --> 01:19:06,261
See that Ching gets those birds.

1129
01:19:21,943 --> 01:19:23,028
Becky!

1130
01:19:24,487 --> 01:19:25,697
Come here.

1131
01:19:34,998 --> 01:19:37,375
There's something I ought to tell you.

1132
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:40,378
Guess now is as good a time as any.

1133
01:19:40,754 --> 01:19:43,040
You're going to have every young buck
west of the Missouri...

1134
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:45,800
around here trying to marry you.

1135
01:19:45,925 --> 01:19:48,595
Mostly because
you're a handsome filly,

1136
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,891
but partly because I own everything in
this country from here to there.

1137
01:19:53,433 --> 01:19:57,228
They'll think you're going to inherit it.
Well, you're not.

1138
01:19:58,188 --> 01:20:00,690
I'm going to leave most of it to...

1139
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:04,068
well, to the nation, really, for a park...

1140
01:20:04,778 --> 01:20:09,699
where no lumbermill will cut down all the
trees for houses with leaky roofs.

1141
01:20:10,492 --> 01:20:13,745
Nobody will kill all the beaver
for hats for dudes...

1142
01:20:14,245 --> 01:20:16,539
nor murder the buffalo for robes.

1143
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,083
What I'm going to give you...

1144
01:20:19,209 --> 01:20:22,086
is a 500-cow spread on the upper Green River.

1145
01:20:23,087 --> 01:20:25,089
Now, that may not seem
like much,

1146
01:20:25,673 --> 01:20:28,510
but it's more than we had,
your mother and I.

1147
01:20:29,802 --> 01:20:32,388
Some folks are going
to say I'm doing all this...

1148
01:20:32,972 --> 01:20:37,519
so I can sit up in the hereafter and
look down on a park named after me,

1149
01:20:38,353 --> 01:20:42,774
or that I was disappointed in you,
didn't want you to get all that money.

1150
01:20:43,316 --> 01:20:46,945
But the real reason, Becky,
is because I love you,

1151
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:51,407
and I want you and some
young man to have what I had,

1152
01:20:52,242 --> 01:20:55,328
because all the gold
in the United States Treasury...

1153
01:20:56,246 --> 01:20:58,456
and all the harp music in heaven...

1154
01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:01,626
can't equal what happens
between a man and a woman...

1155
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:03,795
with all that growing together.

1156
01:21:06,839 --> 01:21:09,217
I can't explain it any better than that.

1157
01:21:16,975 --> 01:21:18,559
All right, Daddy.

1158
01:21:21,521 --> 01:21:22,689
Becky!

1159
01:21:27,193 --> 01:21:30,446
When you're as old as I am,
you'll thank me for this.

1160
01:21:32,365 --> 01:21:34,158
Daddy, I'm full-grown.

1161
01:21:34,993 --> 01:21:37,161
I wasn't worrying about me.

1162
01:21:38,037 --> 01:21:40,415
I was thinking
about you and Mama.

1163
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:03,000
(Woman laughing)

1164
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
(Laughter continues)

1165
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,500
Oh!

1166
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:26,627
JUNIOR: Well, all three of them fell
right out of the carriage.

1167
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:27,620
(Laughter)

1168
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,467
KATE: Well, it's getting rather late, Becky.
It's bedtime.

1169
01:22:32,592 --> 01:22:33,843
Oh, Mother,

1170
01:22:34,927 --> 01:22:37,305
he brought this.
He must have intended to use it.

1171
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:39,140
- Oh, well....
- Sing us a song!

1172
01:22:39,265 --> 01:22:41,893
JUNIOR: Well, if you really want me to.
Gosh, I haven't played...

1173
01:22:42,018 --> 01:22:44,687
BECKY: You know <i>"Just Right for Me?"</i>
- JUNIOR: Sure.

1174
01:22:44,812 --> 01:22:46,522
BECKY: It's the rage now.

1175
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,520
Oh!

1176
01:22:51,819 --> 01:22:54,030
Dev, what are you doing?

1177
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:56,030
DEV: Oh, I, uh...

1178
01:22:58,743 --> 01:23:00,870
I just thought
I'd get another cigar.

1179
01:23:00,995 --> 01:23:04,290
Well, you've got one in your mouth
and two burning in the tray.

1180
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,709
And that move.

1181
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:09,295
JUNIOR: The fellas want me
to play all the time.

1182
01:23:10,797 --> 01:23:15,593
<i>You're cuter than
A baby steer</i>

1183
01:23:16,093 --> 01:23:20,723
<i>And softer than
A mouse's ear</i>

1184
01:23:21,557 --> 01:23:25,728
<i>I want the whole wide world to hear</i>

1185
01:23:26,395 --> 01:23:30,233
<i>You're just right for me</i>

1186
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:34,230
<i>You're sweeter than...</i>

1187
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,240
Oh, no, not that rhythm, Junior.
Do it the way they do it at the Plaza.

1188
01:23:37,365 --> 01:23:40,368
- I know the words.
- Sure, Becky. Will you sing with me?

1189
01:23:40,493 --> 01:23:41,994
- Of course.
- Alright.

1190
01:23:48,084 --> 01:23:52,588
<i>I love a man who's witty and smart,</i>
<i>And clever</i>

1191
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,340
It's your move.

1192
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,840
Oh.

1193
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,840
BECKY: <i>My heart forever</i>

1194
01:23:58,302 --> 01:24:00,721
Oh, Dev, you're playing
like an amateur.

1195
01:24:01,305 --> 01:24:05,476
Let's call it an evening.
I'd like to know where your mind is tonight.

1196
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:10,470
JUNIOR AND BECKY:
<i>You're sweeter than the early stars...</i>

1197
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:13,100
<i>Or bluebells when they start to...</i>

1198
01:24:13,317 --> 01:24:16,362
Pretty good,
voice like her father.

1199
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:22,360
<i>You're just right for me</i>

1200
01:24:23,661 --> 01:24:27,415
<i>Sweeter than honey,
Finer than wine</i>

1201
01:24:27,665 --> 01:24:32,128
<i>I'm sure they found you,</i>
<i>On that honeysuckle vine</i>

1202
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:36,120
JUNIOR: <i>I would melt
In your embrace</i>

1203
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:39,620
BECKY: <i>You'd disappear
Without a trace</i>

1204
01:24:40,386 --> 01:24:44,640
JUNIOR: <i>To die like this
Is no disgrace</i>

1205
01:24:44,849 --> 01:24:50,479
<i>This is the time,
This is the place, For you're</i>

1206
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:54,025
<i>Just right for me!</i>

1207
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:04,410
Well, it's so good, I kind of
hate to break this up,

1208
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:07,747
but we're going to have
that Indian hearing tomorrow morning...

1209
01:25:07,872 --> 01:25:10,624
Sir, about our conversation
earlier this evening,

1210
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,627
- I believe I'd better apologize.
G.W: Yeah?

1211
01:25:14,003 --> 01:25:17,256
Yes, sir, I've been thinking it over,
and when I called you a "reactionary",

1212
01:25:17,381 --> 01:25:21,886
well, that's merely my generation's
term for your generation.

1213
01:25:22,386 --> 01:25:24,847
- Nothing personal, you understand.
- Oh, really?

1214
01:25:27,391 --> 01:25:28,976
Well, good night, sir.

1215
01:25:29,602 --> 01:25:32,855
- Good night, Mrs. McLintock.
KATE: Good night, and do come again.

1216
01:25:33,939 --> 01:25:35,775
JUNIOR: Good night, Drago.
- DRAGO: Good night.

1217
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:42,740
Boss... what does "reactionary" mean?

1218
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:44,575
Me, I guess.

1219
01:25:45,159 --> 01:25:48,704
He says that anyone that wanted to sell
at a profit was a "reactionary".

1220
01:25:48,829 --> 01:25:51,832
Was we "reactionaries" back in them days
when you was selling beef cattle...

1221
01:25:51,957 --> 01:25:53,950
for six cents a pound on the hoof?

1222
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,546
Well, no use arguing with him.
College boy.

1223
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:14,605
Devlin Warren,
if you was my kind of man,

1224
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:17,775
you wouldn't let some dude walk off with
the prettiest girl west of Denver...

1225
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,236
- without putting up some kind of fight.
- Does it show?

1226
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:23,364
What can I do? I'm just one of
her father's employees.

1227
01:26:23,489 --> 01:26:25,282
I'm just a hired hand
around here.

1228
01:26:25,407 --> 01:26:27,243
Every so often, Dev...

1229
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:30,579
you spill the strangest ideas.

1230
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:32,000
(Horse neighing)

1231
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:33,999
Everybody works for somebody.

1232
01:26:34,124 --> 01:26:36,877
Me, I work for everybody
in these United States...

1233
01:26:37,002 --> 01:26:39,755
that steps into a butcher's
shop for a T-bone steak,

1234
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,925
and you work for me.
There's not much difference.

1235
01:26:44,468 --> 01:26:47,680
Daddy, the most terrible
thing just happened!

1236
01:26:47,805 --> 01:26:51,100
Junior's horse ran away,
the one he rented at the livery stable.

1237
01:26:51,225 --> 01:26:54,687
You tied up a rented horse by the reins?
He's probably back in the stall by now.

1238
01:26:54,812 --> 01:26:58,065
I think we can get Junior
something that he can ride.

1239
01:26:58,190 --> 01:27:01,694
What I'd rather do, Daddy,
is drive Junior home in our barouche.

1240
01:27:01,819 --> 01:27:05,489
It's a lovely evening, and I'm sure
Uncle Drago wouldn't mind driving.

1241
01:27:05,614 --> 01:27:08,909
I would, and I got the kind of manners
don't keep me from saying so...

1242
01:27:09,034 --> 01:27:10,244
just to be polite.

1243
01:27:10,369 --> 01:27:12,371
I'll drive him home,
Mr. McLintock,

1244
01:27:12,496 --> 01:27:15,791
and you don't have to come, Miss Becky.
I'll see that he gets home safely.

1245
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:19,420
- I can take care of myself.
- You got yourself a foot, didn't you?

1246
01:27:19,545 --> 01:27:22,965
- Dev, get the carriage. Drago.
- I'm going with them.

1247
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:25,467
DRAGO: Now you got me
wrangling dudes.

1248
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,850
(Becky and Junior singing)

1249
01:27:39,857 --> 01:27:44,236
<i>You make a man</i>
<i>feel like a king</i>

1250
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:47,489
<i>You're just right for me</i>

1251
01:27:48,198 --> 01:27:51,118
Miss Becky, somebody better
help me watch the road.

1252
01:27:51,243 --> 01:27:54,747
You know, I'm new around here.
Might take the wrong turnoff.

1253
01:27:54,872 --> 01:27:59,001
Devlin Warren, you know there isn't
a turnoff between here, and town.

1254
01:27:59,126 --> 01:28:03,047
<i>You disappear
without a trace</i>

1255
01:28:03,172 --> 01:28:07,301
<i>To die like this
Is no disgrace</i>

1256
01:28:07,426 --> 01:28:12,181
BECKY: <i>This is the time
JUNIOR: This is the place</i>

1257
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:14,180
DEV: Yah! Yah!

1258
01:28:15,351 --> 01:28:18,103
Devlin Warren, what are
you trying to do, kill us?

1259
01:28:18,228 --> 01:28:20,814
Would you rather
have your friend drive?

1260
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,210
Yah!

1261
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:23,510
Oh!

1262
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,210
Oh!

1263
01:28:35,829 --> 01:28:37,456
Daddy! Daddy!

1264
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:40,250
I have never been
so humiliated in my entire life!

1265
01:28:40,376 --> 01:28:43,337
I said what I said, and I'll
stand by it to the death.

1266
01:28:43,712 --> 01:28:46,298
Shoot him, Daddy.
Shoot him at once.

1267
01:28:47,049 --> 01:28:50,094
- Well, why?
- My honor is at stake.

1268
01:28:50,385 --> 01:28:53,590
- Well, now, your honor
- Absolutely. He impugned my honor.

1269
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,183
- "Impugned?"
What does that mean?

1270
01:28:56,558 --> 01:28:59,812
- Slander! He slandered my honor!
- He did?

1271
01:28:59,937 --> 01:29:02,689
I said what I said, and I'll
stand by it to the death.

1272
01:29:02,815 --> 01:29:04,817
He admits it! See?
Shoot him!

1273
01:29:04,942 --> 01:29:08,070
- Well, what is he admitting to?
- Why, he called me a...

1274
01:29:08,237 --> 01:29:09,696
I won't even repeat the word.

1275
01:29:09,822 --> 01:29:11,657
I didn't necessarily
call you anything,

1276
01:29:11,782 --> 01:29:14,451
but I said what I said, and I'll
stand by it to the death.

1277
01:29:14,576 --> 01:29:17,538
Well, just for the tally books,
what did you say?

1278
01:29:17,663 --> 01:29:20,040
I said that "any girl who would
permit a man to kiss her...

1279
01:29:20,165 --> 01:29:22,751
"before they're formally engaged
is a trollop."

1280
01:29:22,876 --> 01:29:24,753
He said it again! Shoot him!

1281
01:29:24,878 --> 01:29:27,214
- Now, hold on.
- No, don't hold on!

1282
01:29:27,339 --> 01:29:30,509
If you're my father, if you
love me, you'll shoot him.

1283
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:34,471
Well, I'm your father, and I sure love you...

1284
01:29:34,596 --> 01:29:35,764
so...

1285
01:29:37,724 --> 01:29:40,811
Oh, you shot him!
You really shot him!

1286
01:29:40,936 --> 01:29:42,187
DEV: Hey! 
- If he dies...

1287
01:29:42,312 --> 01:29:45,732
If he dies, he'll be the first man ever
killed with a blank cartridge.

1288
01:29:45,858 --> 01:29:48,569
We use this to start
the races on the Fourth.

1289
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:51,405
DEV: Hey, I'm on fire!

1290
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:54,491
- Oh, you poor dear!
- Poor dear!

1291
01:29:54,616 --> 01:29:58,078
- You'd have had me shot in cold blood!
- But it didn't happen.

1292
01:29:58,203 --> 01:30:01,248
Yelling I insulted you, and all!
What you need is a good spanking!

1293
01:30:01,373 --> 01:30:02,875
Oh, Dev! Daddy!

1294
01:30:03,292 --> 01:30:04,960
Leave me out of this!

1295
01:30:05,627 --> 01:30:08,755
- Oh, I think I'll give you what you deserve.
- You wouldn't dare!

1296
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:09,965
Oh, wouldn't I?

1297
01:30:10,090 --> 01:30:12,759
You'll think next time
before you have someone shot!

1298
01:30:12,885 --> 01:30:14,761
This kicking and yelling
isn't going to help!

1299
01:30:14,887 --> 01:30:16,889
Don't! Daddy, wait
a second! Daddy!

1300
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,480
Ow!

1301
01:30:19,766 --> 01:30:22,853
Daddy, help me! Don't!

1302
01:30:23,645 --> 01:30:27,149
Devlin Warren, I hate you!
I hate you!

1303
01:30:27,649 --> 01:30:30,277
Mommy! Mommy!

1304
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,080
BECKY: Oh!

1305
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:32,946
G.W, was that a shot?

1306
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,940
Ohh!

1307
01:30:40,662 --> 01:30:43,624
- Becky, what happened?
- He spanked me!

1308
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:48,003
You spanked my daughter?

1309
01:30:48,378 --> 01:30:49,463
Dev.

1310
01:30:51,256 --> 01:30:55,010
You mean you stood there while
that brute beat our daughter?

1311
01:30:55,302 --> 01:30:57,137
G.W, what's happened to you
in the last three years?

1312
01:30:57,262 --> 01:30:58,388
Better part of valor, son.

1313
01:30:58,513 --> 01:31:01,099
KATE: Isn't it enough that you've always
treated me like a squaw...

1314
01:31:01,224 --> 01:31:04,478
without subjecting dear, sweet Becky
to this crude, vulgar...

1315
01:31:04,603 --> 01:31:07,522
Katherine, you women are always
raising hell about one thing...

1316
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,233
when it's something else
you're really sore about.

1317
01:31:10,359 --> 01:31:12,319
Don't you think it's
about time you told me...

1318
01:31:12,444 --> 01:31:15,322
what put the burr
under your saddle about me?

1319
01:31:15,447 --> 01:31:19,076
I don't intend to stand here
and hold a midnight conversation...

1320
01:31:19,201 --> 01:31:21,328
with an intoxicated man.

1321
01:31:30,337 --> 01:31:32,923
And I am not intoxicated...

1322
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:35,920
(Door slams)

1323
01:31:36,802 --> 01:31:37,886
Yet!

1324
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,521
- Hello, Governor!
- Hello, Governor!

1325
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:09,751
- Chief Puma.
- Yes, Sergeant.

1326
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:14,506
Big McLintock, we know
you'll get us fair judgment.

1327
01:32:15,006 --> 01:32:16,967
SERGEANT:
You gentlemen, follow me.

1328
01:32:22,097 --> 01:32:24,933
- Well, Jake.?
- G.W.

1329
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:35,944
- Well, G.W., it's been a long time.
- G.W: Not long enough... Cuthbert.

1330
01:32:38,613 --> 01:32:42,409
- Your husband is a rude man.
- Yes, Cuthbert, I know.

1331
01:32:55,839 --> 01:32:58,091
Where you want the Indians,
Mr. McLintock?

1332
01:32:58,216 --> 01:33:00,927
Mr. McLintock is not
running this hearing.

1333
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,180
- Sergeant, seat those Indians.
- Yes, sir.

1334
01:33:04,306 --> 01:33:05,932
Gentlemen, be seated.

1335
01:33:07,976 --> 01:33:10,770
Their whole tribe here
wanted to come into town.

1336
01:33:10,896 --> 01:33:12,397
Proceed, Lieutenant.

1337
01:33:14,566 --> 01:33:16,276
This hearing is now in session,

1338
01:33:16,401 --> 01:33:18,695
Governor Cuthbert Humphreys
presiding.

1339
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,280
BECKY: Good luck, Daddy.

1340
01:33:20,488 --> 01:33:22,657
G.W: I'm afraid
it's a packed court.

1341
01:33:22,782 --> 01:33:24,618
CUTHBERT:
Government edict number 826.

1342
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:27,954
"As ordered that the Comanche
nation be transferred..."

1343
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:30,790
"from their present reservation
to Fort Sill,"

1344
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:34,669
"it is the government's claim as
filed by Indian agent Agard..."

1345
01:33:36,379 --> 01:33:40,467
"that these chiefs, after being released
from prison by a kindly government..."

1346
01:33:40,592 --> 01:33:44,971
"did then rouse and incite defiance
among the tribe against said order."

1347
01:33:46,514 --> 01:33:50,143
It seems, gentlemen,  that although some
of these chiefs speak English...

1348
01:33:50,268 --> 01:33:53,063
Chief Puma is quite at home
in our language...

1349
01:33:53,438 --> 01:33:56,733
they have chosen Mr. McLintock
to be their spokesman.

1350
01:33:57,233 --> 01:34:01,613
G.W: I speak for the Comanche,
or rather I offer this translation.

1351
01:34:02,197 --> 01:34:04,115
Proceed, Mr. McLintock.

1352
01:34:11,539 --> 01:34:13,249
The Comanches says...

1353
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:17,170
<i>"We are an old people,
and a proud people.</i>

1354
01:34:17,671 --> 01:34:19,631
<i>"When the White Man
first came among us,</i>

1355
01:34:19,756 --> 01:34:22,759
<i>"we were as many as
the grasses of the prairie.</i>

1356
01:34:23,677 --> 01:34:26,971
<i>"Now we are few,
but we are still proud.</i>

1357
01:34:27,722 --> 01:34:31,184
<i>"For if a man lose his pride
and manhood, he is nothing.</i>

1358
01:34:31,935 --> 01:34:34,854
<i>"You tell us now that if we will
let you send us away...</i>

1359
01:34:34,979 --> 01:34:37,440
<i>"to this place called Fort Sill,</i>

1360
01:34:37,565 --> 01:34:40,068
<i>"you will feed us
and care for us.</i>

1361
01:34:40,735 --> 01:34:42,529
<i>"Let us tell you this:</i>

1362
01:34:42,987 --> 01:34:45,657
<i>"It is a Comanche law
that no chief ever eats...</i>

1363
01:34:45,782 --> 01:34:48,910
<i>"unless first he sees that
the pots are full of meat...</i>

1364
01:34:49,035 --> 01:34:51,663
<i>"in the lodges of
the widows and orphans.</i>

1365
01:34:51,788 --> 01:34:54,040
<i>"It is the Comanche way of life.</i>

1366
01:34:55,083 --> 01:35:00,130
<i>"This that the White Man calls 'charity'
is a fine thing for widows and orphans,</i>

1367
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,218
<i>"but no warrior can accept it,
for if he does, he is no longer a man...</i>

1368
01:35:05,343 --> 01:35:08,138
<i>"and when he is no longer a man,
he is nothing...</i>

1369
01:35:08,555 --> 01:35:10,056
<i>"and better off dead.</i>

1370
01:35:10,181 --> 01:35:14,769
<i>"You say to the Comanche: 'You are widows
and orphans. You are not men.'</i>

1371
01:35:14,978 --> 01:35:17,939
<i>"And we the Comanches say:
'we would rather be dead'.</i>

1372
01:35:18,064 --> 01:35:21,151
<i>"It will not be a remembered
fight when you kill us,</i>

1373
01:35:21,276 --> 01:35:24,320
<i>"because we are few now,
and have few weapons,</i>

1374
01:35:24,821 --> 01:35:28,491
<i>"but we will fight,
and we will die Comanche."</i>

1375
01:35:32,704 --> 01:35:34,664
Thank you, Big McLintock.

1376
01:35:35,206 --> 01:35:39,586
Am I to gather the Comanche defy
the government of the United States?

1377
01:35:39,711 --> 01:35:44,257
Yes, you may gather that the Comanche
defy the United States government...

1378
01:35:44,465 --> 01:35:47,010
- or at least this commission.
HUMPHREYS: Gentlemen.

1379
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,314
It is the order of this court, that these chiefs
be incarcerated until such time...

1380
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:02,192
as the detachment
of United States cavalry...

1381
01:36:02,317 --> 01:36:03,776
be made avaible...

1382
01:36:03,902 --> 01:36:06,988
to escort them
and the Comanche nation to Fort Sill.

1383
01:36:09,032 --> 01:36:10,950
This court is adjourned.

1384
01:36:14,537 --> 01:36:15,914
PUMA: McLintock,

1385
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:18,708
you are important chief amongst these white people.

1386
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,210
Sway them.

1387
01:36:20,335 --> 01:36:23,796
Have them give us few guns
to make the fight worthwhile.

1388
01:36:24,047 --> 01:36:27,634
Let us have one last remembered
fight for end of Comanche.

1389
01:36:28,092 --> 01:36:30,929
I almost wish
I could arrange that, Puma.

1390
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,920
(G.W. and Puma speaking Comanche)
Aha loni cha!

1391
01:36:37,852 --> 01:36:39,687
- Sergent.
- Yes?

1392
01:36:39,812 --> 01:36:41,898
Left, right, carry on.

1393
01:36:42,148 --> 01:36:43,316
Gentlemen!

1394
01:36:52,408 --> 01:36:54,410
It's sad, these changing times.

1395
01:36:55,536 --> 01:36:58,289
It isn't the times
that are changing, Mama.

1396
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:11,280
(Indians chanting)

1397
01:37:23,064 --> 01:37:24,357
Hi, G.W.

1398
01:37:24,482 --> 01:37:25,858
Hello, Lem.

1399
01:37:41,749 --> 01:37:42,875
Bunny.

1400
01:37:44,544 --> 01:37:46,087
Oh, howdy, McLintock.

1401
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:49,382
Figured you'd be
belly-down drunk by now.

1402
01:37:49,507 --> 01:37:52,427
I've been doing some
thinking drinking, Bunny.

1403
01:37:52,969 --> 01:37:55,096
Is that boxcar still on the siding?

1404
01:37:55,221 --> 01:37:57,223
BUNNY: Well, sure, but...
G.W: But what?

1405
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:59,559
BUNNY: I don't like it.
G.W: You don't, eh?

1406
01:37:59,684 --> 01:38:01,310
BUNNY: You figure if
them Indians get out of there...

1407
01:38:01,436 --> 01:38:03,396
and lead the cavalry
on a wild goose chase,

1408
01:38:03,521 --> 01:38:04,856
that Great White Father's
going to get nosy.

1409
01:38:04,981 --> 01:38:07,191
G.W: Get nosy,
and he'll investigate,

1410
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:09,902
and when they find out,
how that sidesaddle governor's...

1411
01:38:10,027 --> 01:38:11,654
been messing things up,

1412
01:38:11,779 --> 01:38:13,781
they'll give those Indians
a fair trial.

1413
01:38:13,906 --> 01:38:15,908
BUNNY: That's live ammunition
in that boxcar.

1414
01:38:16,033 --> 01:38:18,911
You know what will happen, if them Indians
get some guns in their hands?

1415
01:38:19,036 --> 01:38:20,329
Somebody is going to get hurt.

1416
01:38:20,455 --> 01:38:23,082
- Is Puma's word good enough for you?
BUNNY: Well, I don't...

1417
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:26,544
McLintock, you got yourself a partner.

1418
01:38:26,669 --> 01:38:28,171
G.W: Leave me out of this.

1419
01:38:28,671 --> 01:38:29,755
Hey, McLintock...

1420
01:38:32,967 --> 01:38:34,552
Ha ha ha.
Good night, Bunny.

1421
01:38:37,054 --> 01:38:38,806
Good night, Governor.

1422
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,170
Governor!

1423
01:38:42,685 --> 01:38:44,220
<i>Where is the Katie</i>

1424
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:49,275
<i>With her light red hair?</i>

1425
01:38:50,651 --> 01:38:53,112
<i>Sweet as the roses</i>

1426
01:38:53,237 --> 01:38:56,115
<i>On the summer air</i>

1427
01:38:56,407 --> 01:38:59,118
<i>I'll find her somewhere</i>

1428
01:38:59,243 --> 01:39:03,039
<i>While the moon is high</i>

1429
01:39:03,164 --> 01:39:06,459
<i>And tell her
that I love her</i>

1430
01:39:06,709 --> 01:39:10,296
<i>And I'll love her till I die</i>

1431
01:39:10,421 --> 01:39:11,464
Katie!

1432
01:39:12,298 --> 01:39:16,802
Katherine Gilhooly McLintock!
The master's home!

1433
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,800
Katie!
Katie!

1434
01:39:21,682 --> 01:39:24,769
"Katherine Gilhooly McLintock."

1435
01:39:25,228 --> 01:39:27,230
Where's the woman of the house?

1436
01:39:27,772 --> 01:39:29,106
MRS. WARREN:
Uh, Mr. McLintock.

1437
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:31,859
G.W: Oh, there you...

1438
01:39:32,818 --> 01:39:36,113
Mrs. Warren!
Oh, good evening.

1439
01:39:36,906 --> 01:39:40,117
- I waited up for you, Mr. McLintock.
- G.W: Oh, how nice.

1440
01:39:40,785 --> 01:39:43,788
WARREN: I want to talk to you about something.
G.W: Delighted, delighted.

1441
01:39:44,956 --> 01:39:48,793
- 309 times straight.
- I beg your pardon?

1442
01:39:48,918 --> 01:39:53,297
309 times straight, without a miss.
Got to be a record.

1443
01:39:53,631 --> 01:39:56,300
MRS. WARREN: I suppose so. Now,
Mr. McLintock, what I wanted to say...

1444
01:39:56,425 --> 01:39:59,261
Two-pound Stetson with
6-inch brim,

1445
01:39:59,387 --> 01:40:02,723
53 feet in the air,
It's got to be a record.

1446
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:05,226
I'm sure it is,
but the reason I waited...

1447
01:40:05,351 --> 01:40:08,646
Dagnammit, woman,
can't you hold that glass still?

1448
01:40:08,771 --> 01:40:10,147
Of course, sir.

1449
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:11,200
Now...

1450
01:40:11,857 --> 01:40:14,568
Down the hatch
to my world's record.

1451
01:40:16,988 --> 01:40:18,489
Down the hatch!

1452
01:40:19,323 --> 01:40:20,574
MRS. WARREN: 
Yes, sir.

1453
01:40:26,956 --> 01:40:30,334
And now...
to the governor of our territory.

1454
01:40:31,335 --> 01:40:33,462
T-t-the governor
of the territory, sir?

1455
01:40:33,587 --> 01:40:36,382
Now, don't you stick up for him,
Mrs. Warren.

1456
01:40:36,507 --> 01:40:38,384
You're a fine woman,
Mrs. Warren,

1457
01:40:38,509 --> 01:40:41,137
but you'll certainly go down
in my estimation...

1458
01:40:41,262 --> 01:40:45,224
if you stick up for Cuthbert H. Humphreys,
governor of this territory.

1459
01:40:45,516 --> 01:40:48,269
- I don't mean to change the...
G.W: Down the hatch.

1460
01:40:49,061 --> 01:40:51,355
Aw... yes sir.
Down the hatch.

1461
01:40:54,734 --> 01:40:58,320
Cuthbert H. Humphreys, governor
of our territory,

1462
01:40:58,529 --> 01:41:00,406
is a cull.

1463
01:41:00,531 --> 01:41:02,491
Do you know
what a "cull" is, ma'am?

1464
01:41:03,659 --> 01:41:07,121
A "cull" is a specimen
that is so worthless...

1465
01:41:07,413 --> 01:41:09,331
that you have to cut him
out of the herd.

1466
01:41:09,457 --> 01:41:13,085
Now, if all the people in the
world were put in one herd,

1467
01:41:13,586 --> 01:41:16,255
Cuthbert is the one
I would throw my rope at.

1468
01:41:16,547 --> 01:41:19,550
At whom, at whom I would throw
my rope at.

1469
01:41:20,509 --> 01:41:22,303
Natural born "cull".

1470
01:41:22,678 --> 01:41:25,973
- Another touch, ma'am?
- Oh, no, sir, no.

1471
01:41:30,436 --> 01:41:32,897
- Well, I, I don't mind if I do.
G.W: Good.

1472
01:41:33,272 --> 01:41:34,773
You can't walk on one leg.

1473
01:41:34,899 --> 01:41:38,736
Oh, I didn't mean to be vulgar, ma'am.
Can't walk on one limb.

1474
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,237
MRS. WARREN: It's all right.

1475
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:43,866
G.W: Sounds silly.
Only a bird can walk on a limb.

1476
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:46,994
You know my wife?
Her name's "Katie".

1477
01:41:47,411 --> 01:41:50,247
She insists on being called "Katherine".
Do you know her?

1478
01:41:50,372 --> 01:41:53,083
Of course, Mr. McLintock, and
that's what I wanted to talk...

1479
01:41:53,209 --> 01:41:56,670
Well, she thinks that Cuthbert H. Humphreys...

1480
01:41:56,795 --> 01:42:00,799
is panting for her like a bull buffalo
at the first green-up of spring.

1481
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:04,678
But what Cuthbert is panting for
is my money.

1482
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:06,390
(Tsk tsk tsk)

1483
01:42:06,597 --> 01:42:09,391
Don't make me feel
like I'm drinking alone, ma'am.

1484
01:42:09,558 --> 01:42:12,937
Very well, Mr. McLintock,
if you insist.

1485
01:42:14,021 --> 01:42:16,899
- Down the hatch!
- Good!

1486
01:42:30,246 --> 01:42:31,705
Mr. McLintock...

1487
01:42:32,998 --> 01:42:35,876
I have something very important
to say to you.

1488
01:42:37,753 --> 01:42:39,171
Very important.

1489
01:42:41,757 --> 01:42:44,385
Guess it'll have to wait
till the morning.

1490
01:42:45,261 --> 01:42:46,387
Toodles.

1491
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:47,420
Oh!

1492
01:42:47,721 --> 01:42:49,431
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

1493
01:42:50,975 --> 01:42:52,434
Beddy bye-bye.

1494
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,930
Whoops... Oh!

1495
01:43:02,987 --> 01:43:06,782
Mrs. Warren,
Let me assist you.

1496
01:43:07,366 --> 01:43:08,826
Very kind.

1497
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:19,820
(Laughter)

1498
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,820
Ooop... ooop... oop!

1499
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:25,820
Aaah!

1500
01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:28,820
(Laughter)

1501
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,320
Whoops!

1502
01:43:33,017 --> 01:43:34,852
What's going on here?

1503
01:43:35,352 --> 01:43:38,731
Now, Katherine, are you going
to believe what you see...

1504
01:43:38,856 --> 01:43:40,774
or what I tell you?

1505
01:43:40,810 --> 01:43:41,820
Oh!

1506
01:43:44,653 --> 01:43:48,240
Uh, Mrs. McLintock,
hope you won't misunderstand.

1507
01:43:48,824 --> 01:43:52,327
It's the first hundred women sitting
on his lap that I misunderstood.

1508
01:43:52,453 --> 01:43:55,039
Number 101 is quite simple.

1509
01:43:55,164 --> 01:43:57,249
Now, G.W. McLintock,
I have something...

1510
01:43:59,418 --> 01:44:01,170
He's gone to sleep.

1511
01:44:02,045 --> 01:44:05,174
Just when I know exactly what I
want to say to him,

1512
01:44:05,299 --> 01:44:07,050
he goes to sleep.

1513
01:44:08,802 --> 01:44:12,389
I waited up
to talk to Mr. McLintock.

1514
01:44:13,766 --> 01:44:15,893
I wanted to tell him
I was quitting.

1515
01:44:16,018 --> 01:44:20,189
You see, Sheriff Lord has asked
me to marry him, and...

1516
01:44:21,398 --> 01:44:23,025
Oh, oh, congratulations!

1517
01:44:23,817 --> 01:44:27,821
I don't want to seem prudish, but if you
are going to marry Sheriff Lord,

1518
01:44:27,946 --> 01:44:31,283
it seems to me that you're
sitting on the wrong man's lap.

1519
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,280
Oh!

1520
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,500
(Mrs. Warren laughs)

1521
01:44:35,662 --> 01:44:37,456
Come on, I'll help you upstairs,

1522
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:40,459
and we'll have a long talk
about men in general.

1523
01:44:43,128 --> 01:44:44,300
Ladies...

1524
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,000
One moment!

1525
01:44:58,101 --> 01:45:00,687
Watch out!
You'll get us all killed!

1526
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:01,840
Whoops!

1527
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:02,940
(Screams)

1528
01:45:08,028 --> 01:45:10,697
Wait a minute, ladies,
till I catch my breath,

1529
01:45:10,822 --> 01:45:13,242
then I'll get you
up those stairs,

1530
01:45:13,367 --> 01:45:18,247
as sure as my name is
"George Washington McLintoooock".

1531
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,555
KATE: You may be quitting, Mrs. Wallace...
- Mrs. Warren.

1532
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:35,931
KATE: But not tomorrow.

1533
01:45:36,056 --> 01:45:38,559
I want my breakfast in bed.
I want...

1534
01:45:38,684 --> 01:45:40,894
MRS. WARREN: I know.
Toast, lightly browned...

1535
01:45:41,019 --> 01:45:43,605
Somebody sure put a knob
on my skull.

1536
01:45:44,189 --> 01:45:47,359
DRAGO: It was Katie.
G.W: Katie? Why?

1537
01:45:48,151 --> 01:45:50,320
DRAGO: Mrs. Warren was there...

1538
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:51,430
Ooh...

1539
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:55,325
And there you was, there,
and there the whiskey bottle was, there.

1540
01:45:55,450 --> 01:45:59,079
And Katie's temper being what Katie's
temper is, well... there you are.

1541
01:45:59,538 --> 01:46:01,248
Drago, old friend,

1542
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,001
my wife does not understand me.

1543
01:46:04,126 --> 01:46:06,253
DRAGO: Why should she be
any different than any other?

1544
01:46:06,378 --> 01:46:08,255
Come on,
l got to get you up the stairs.

1545
01:46:08,380 --> 01:46:11,049
Get you ready for
that big celebration tomorrow.

1546
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:12,050
Watch it!

1547
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,170
Oh!

1548
01:46:18,348 --> 01:46:22,311
Drago...
I am sleeping in the den.

1549
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:26,500
(Band playing)

1550
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:33,800
(Firecrackers explode)

1551
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,200
(Laughter)

1552
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,800
Hooligans!

1553
01:46:40,954 --> 01:46:43,206
Ain't got no respect
for your elders.

1554
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,200
(Chanting)
Bunny lost his temper!

1555
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:55,200
(Chanting continues)Bunny lost his temper!
Bunny lost his temper!

1556
01:46:55,761 --> 01:46:59,514
Scallywags! Little imps!
I hope you get the measles!

1557
01:47:04,895 --> 01:47:06,605
G.W: Come on,
get him aboard.

1558
01:47:06,813 --> 01:47:08,190
Is everybody ready?

1559
01:47:08,565 --> 01:47:11,109
MAN: Uh, number five
needs a flank cinch.

1560
01:47:11,234 --> 01:47:12,569
G.W: Get him one.

1561
01:47:14,696 --> 01:47:16,531
Let us know when you're ready.

1562
01:47:16,782 --> 01:47:19,701
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1563
01:47:20,035 --> 01:47:23,163
<i>It is my honor to present to you...</i>

1564
01:47:23,497 --> 01:47:26,291
<i>the governor of our territory,</i>

1565
01:47:26,875 --> 01:47:30,003
<i>Cuthbert H. Humphrey.</i>
(Applause beginning)

1566
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:30,650
(Applause)

1567
01:47:30,712 --> 01:47:32,297
GOVERNOR: <i>Thank you, Mayor.</i>

1568
01:47:34,257 --> 01:47:38,386
My friends and citizens of this
great territory,

1569
01:47:38,804 --> 01:47:41,348
this is the ninth
consecutive year...

1570
01:47:41,932 --> 01:47:45,602
it has been my privilege
and my pleasure...

1571
01:47:45,727 --> 01:47:49,940
to inaugurate the McLintock
Fourth of July celebration.

1572
01:47:50,899 --> 01:47:53,860
Now, the first event will be
the wild horse race.

1573
01:47:54,694 --> 01:47:58,073
But before I fire the shot to
start the event,

1574
01:47:58,573 --> 01:48:01,451
I would like to say
a few modest words...

1575
01:48:01,743 --> 01:48:06,164
regarding my stewardship
of this great territory.

1576
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:07,660
(Firecracker explodes)

1577
01:48:07,690 --> 01:48:10,660
(Cheering)

1578
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:44,660
Ride it, Ben!
Crush him! Crush him!

1579
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:48,860
Whoo-hoo!

1580
01:48:52,669 --> 01:48:55,589
- All right, Professor Birnbaum.
- Gentlemen.

1581
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,580
(Band plays)

1582
01:48:58,883 --> 01:49:00,260
Sheriff, here's your horse.

1583
01:49:00,385 --> 01:49:02,554
DRAGO: Come on, get them all lined up.
Come here, Ching.

1584
01:49:02,679 --> 01:49:05,098
Now, boys,
you all know the rules.

1585
01:49:05,223 --> 01:49:07,976
It's twice around the inside
and once around the outside.

1586
01:49:08,101 --> 01:49:12,188
First cowboy that hits that finish line
without busting that egg is a winner.

1587
01:49:12,314 --> 01:49:15,066
And I caution you boys about
some of them eggs,

1588
01:49:15,191 --> 01:49:18,278
'cause some of them eggs
are last year's holdovers.

1589
01:49:21,906 --> 01:49:23,616
DRAGO: All right, mount up.

1590
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:33,610
(Gunshot)

1591
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:49,559
Katherine, my dear, you
seem to be enjoying yourself.

1592
01:49:49,684 --> 01:49:51,936
Oh, yes.
This is wonderful.

1593
01:49:52,062 --> 01:49:54,814
It's is the only thing l really do enjoy
about this barbaric country:

1594
01:49:54,939 --> 01:49:56,900
the Fourth of July celebration.

1595
01:49:59,486 --> 01:50:02,614
Well, Katherine, I've been here for three days.
I haven't heard from you.

1596
01:50:02,739 --> 01:50:04,407
- Is anything wrong?
- Wrong?

1597
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:08,828
Well, I just hope that it hasn't been
necessary for you to say anything...

1598
01:50:09,037 --> 01:50:10,455
...to G.W.

1599
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:14,459
What are you talking about?

1600
01:50:15,919 --> 01:50:19,631
Well, Katherine, you see, I'm
in a rather delicate position,

1601
01:50:19,756 --> 01:50:21,841
being governor of the territory
and all.

1602
01:50:21,966 --> 01:50:25,887
I just hope you haven't found it necessary
to say anything about...

1603
01:50:26,179 --> 01:50:27,555
About... what?

1604
01:50:28,556 --> 01:50:30,266
About you and me.

1605
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:40,485
Why, you pompous windbag.

1606
01:50:41,236 --> 01:50:45,031
Do you think that you're the only man,
who's ever tried to play pattyfingers with me?

1607
01:50:45,156 --> 01:50:47,242
Who's ever tried
to lure me into the moonlight?

1608
01:50:47,367 --> 01:50:48,493
Well, no, but I...

1609
01:50:48,618 --> 01:50:51,287
Well, I'm a big girl,
and I can take care of myself.

1610
01:50:51,412 --> 01:50:52,872
My husband knows it.

1611
01:50:52,997 --> 01:50:56,960
I can assure you, Governor, that
your reputation is untarnished.

1612
01:50:57,085 --> 01:50:59,546
Now get out of my way.

1613
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,240
(Crowd laughs)

1614
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:25,029
Folks, we got ourselves a winner.
Curly Fletcher!

1615
01:51:25,572 --> 01:51:27,198
JAKE: Mazel tov, Curly!

1616
01:51:29,242 --> 01:51:30,618
DRAGO: Give me the egg.

1617
01:51:33,288 --> 01:51:34,873
Disqualified!

1618
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,170
(Laughter)

1619
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,252
Here you go, Curly.

1620
01:51:41,462 --> 01:51:43,965
G.W, G.W, you'll never believe
what happened over there.

1621
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:45,174
What?

1622
01:51:45,508 --> 01:51:49,429
- You smell of beer.
- Well, naturally, I'm drinking beer.

1623
01:51:50,430 --> 01:51:52,098
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1624
01:51:52,557 --> 01:51:55,018
<i>the next event
will be a contest...</i>

1625
01:51:55,226 --> 01:51:59,897
<i>between the two bronco-busting
champions of ....</i>

1626
01:52:00,023 --> 01:52:01,482
<i>our territory</i>

1627
01:52:01,608 --> 01:52:03,901
You remember the year
I rode in that event?

1628
01:52:04,027 --> 01:52:06,696
Wore your garters
to hold up my sleeves?

1629
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:07,150
Shhh!

1630
01:52:07,196 --> 01:52:09,407
We had a bet, and I won it.

1631
01:52:10,742 --> 01:52:14,454
George Washington McLintock,
you are a very crude man.

1632
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:19,208
Well, I guess so, but that was a rough horse,
like to jarred my insides loose.

1633
01:52:19,334 --> 01:52:20,960
But it was worth it.

1634
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:21,930
Oh!

1635
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:22,930
(Laughter)

1636
01:52:25,089 --> 01:52:26,966
Free beers!

1637
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:28,580
(Men cheer)

1638
01:52:54,369 --> 01:52:58,289
JAKE: One... two... three...
Go!

1639
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:59,310
(Cheering)

1640
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:22,310
Pull him, Dev
 Pull him! Pull him!

1641
01:53:33,032 --> 01:53:35,618
- Dev, Dev, are you all right?
- I guess so.

1642
01:53:35,743 --> 01:53:37,870
Nothing busted but my pride.

1643
01:53:37,995 --> 01:53:40,206
Well, that ought to
even things up, farmer.

1644
01:53:40,331 --> 01:53:41,374
For what?

1645
01:53:41,499 --> 01:53:44,001
For that sore nose you gave me
the other day.

1646
01:53:44,127 --> 01:53:46,587
DRAGO: Well, that ain't
what's sore on him.

1647
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:59,580
(Indians yelling)

1648
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:08,401
<i>The closing event
is the cow pony race..</i>

1649
01:54:08,609 --> 01:54:11,696
<i>The finish line
is at the barbecue.</i>

1650
01:54:11,821 --> 01:54:14,198
So, start meandering.

1651
01:54:15,074 --> 01:54:16,284
DRAGO: Come on!

1652
01:54:17,869 --> 01:54:20,746
Now, what is that?
False courage?

1653
01:54:22,039 --> 01:54:25,793
Why, you know a Douglas doesn't
ever use a thing like that.

1654
01:54:25,918 --> 01:54:29,797
I want you to get on that horse, get out
in front and stay out in front.

1655
01:54:30,089 --> 01:54:31,966
I'll be out in front, Dad,

1656
01:54:32,091 --> 01:54:35,052
- all the way.
- Aw, good boy.

1657
01:54:35,678 --> 01:54:39,515
Now, remember, stay out in front.
That Agamemnon's a good horse.

1658
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:44,050
(Horse neighing)

1659
01:54:44,103 --> 01:54:45,479
Whoah, Agamemnon.

1660
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:50,470
(Whistle blows)

1661
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:53,195
MAN: 11:40, and she's on time.

1662
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,190
Whoah, boy! Dad!

1663
01:55:15,343 --> 01:55:16,761
Whoah!

1664
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,760
(Train whistle blowing)

1665
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,000
Oh, McLin...

1666
01:56:23,536 --> 01:56:26,497
Big party.
Where's your whiskey?

1667
01:56:28,916 --> 01:56:32,670
- Whose idea was this stunt?
- Duck, doggone it, them are real bullets.

1668
01:57:13,586 --> 01:57:15,379
BUNNY: Reckon that's about
all the excitement you'd want...

1669
01:57:15,504 --> 01:57:16,881
for one Fourth of July, eh?

1670
01:57:17,006 --> 01:57:18,382
DRAGO:
Old Puma finally got his way.

1671
01:57:18,507 --> 01:57:20,551
But I reckon he's riding out
his last war party.

1672
01:57:20,676 --> 01:57:22,428
G.W:
Well, he won't get very far.

1673
01:57:22,553 --> 01:57:26,098
JAKE: But one thing still has me puzzled.
Where did they get the guns?

1674
01:57:26,265 --> 01:57:28,434
G.W:
I was wondering the same thing.

1675
01:57:29,852 --> 01:57:32,646
BUNNY: My kidney's been bothering me...
G.W: Bunny...

1676
01:57:33,939 --> 01:57:35,065
(Whispering)
G.W.! Psst! Pssst!

1677
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:39,550
(G.W. laughing)

1678
01:57:39,945 --> 01:57:41,697
What an idiotic joke!

1679
01:57:41,822 --> 01:57:44,450
- Joke! Do you think that was a joke?
- Well, shut up!

1680
01:57:44,575 --> 01:57:46,702
Do you want everybody in town
to see me?

1681
01:57:46,827 --> 01:57:48,203
You look good in feathers.

1682
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,200
Oh!

1683
01:57:52,666 --> 01:57:55,920
- BECKY: Dev, I think they've gone.
DEV: Yeah!

1684
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:57,755
What are you
going to do about it?

1685
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,757
- What can I do?
- Nothing!

1686
01:58:00,132 --> 01:58:02,217
Just like you've always done!

1687
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:04,210
Oh!

1688
01:58:13,729 --> 01:58:15,230
How long, G.W.?

1689
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:17,524
- How long, what?
- Katherine.

1690
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:20,527
DRAGO: She's been riding herd
on you for two years now.

1691
01:58:20,653 --> 01:58:21,945
JAKE: I'm a peaceable man,

1692
01:58:22,071 --> 01:58:24,320
but my father used to say:
<i>"You raise your voice,"</i>

1693
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,820
<i>"it doesn't do any good,"</i>

1694
01:58:25,949 --> 01:58:27,451
<i>"it's time to raise your hand."</i>

1695
01:58:27,576 --> 01:58:30,329
Well, I've been planning to do
something about it. I'll, uh...

1696
01:58:31,163 --> 01:58:33,832
- I'll have another talk with her.
JAKE: Talk to her?

1697
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:37,461
Talk to her!
Talking won't do any good.

1698
01:58:40,756 --> 01:58:42,633
Becky, have you seen your m...

1699
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:45,469
What's been happening
around here?

1700
01:58:46,512 --> 01:58:48,639
You've got hay all over you.

1701
01:58:48,764 --> 01:58:53,060
Been some mighty sneaky goings-on here
during that raid, Mr. McLintock.

1702
01:58:54,353 --> 01:58:57,314
Who was it said only a trollop would kiss
a man before...

1703
01:58:57,439 --> 01:58:58,982
 they were formally engaged?

1704
01:58:59,108 --> 01:59:01,151
- Oh, but we are engaged, sir.
- You are?

1705
01:59:01,276 --> 01:59:03,153
That is, with your permission.

1706
01:59:04,029 --> 01:59:07,074
Well, you've got it.
Oh, Mrs. Warren?

1707
01:59:08,033 --> 01:59:10,035
I think it's wonderful.

1708
01:59:11,787 --> 01:59:16,250
I guess this is the only engagement,
that ever started off of a spanking.

1709
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:17,800
(Laughter)

1710
01:59:20,379 --> 01:59:22,423
DRAGO: Mm-hmm,
I reckon Birnbaum was right.

1711
01:59:25,968 --> 01:59:27,261
All right.

1712
01:59:29,763 --> 01:59:32,933
Lord bless us,
this is gonna be a great day.

1713
01:59:33,058 --> 01:59:34,393
Doggone it, folks,

1714
01:59:34,518 --> 01:59:38,856
let's don't let a little old Indian raid
break up a good barbecue and a rodeo.

1715
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:40,357
(Cheering)

1716
01:59:40,357 --> 01:59:42,651
- The meat's on!
- Let's go!

1717
01:59:43,110 --> 01:59:46,196
You contestants get ready
for the cow pony race.

1718
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:47,990
(Cheering)

1719
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:50,590
(Knock on door)
 "Shave and a Haircut, two bits"

1720
01:59:50,742 --> 01:59:53,162
- Who is it?
G.W: It's me. Let me in.

1721
01:59:54,246 --> 01:59:55,372
Not now.

1722
01:59:55,530 --> 01:59:57,458
(Slams door open)
Right now!

1723
01:59:57,583 --> 02:00:00,294
KATE: Are you insane?
G.W: I want to talk to you.

1724
02:00:01,086 --> 02:00:02,713
KATE: It'll have to wait.

1725
02:00:04,423 --> 02:00:05,507
Oh, G.W.!

1726
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:08,510
G.W: I've taken all I'm going to take from you.
KATE: You are insane.

1727
02:00:08,635 --> 02:00:10,762
You are going to tell me why you
packed up, picked up,

1728
02:00:10,888 --> 02:00:12,389
and walked out on me.

1729
02:00:12,514 --> 02:00:15,392
Two years ago... you remember...
you came home from Denver...

1730
02:00:15,517 --> 02:00:17,352
with lipstick all over your...

1731
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:18,650
Aaah!

1732
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,050
(Crowd laughing)

1733
02:00:23,108 --> 02:00:25,235
Lipstick on my collar.

1734
02:00:27,230 --> 02:00:28,530
(Crowd laughing)

1735
02:00:28,614 --> 02:00:31,408
KATE: I've got the shirt to prove it.
G.W: Who cares!

1736
02:00:32,242 --> 02:00:33,994
Why, you big...

1737
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:35,490
Ah!

1738
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
(Crowd laughing)

1739
02:00:53,388 --> 02:00:54,765
GOVERNOR: Katherine!

1740
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:56,000
Ah!

1741
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
(Crowd laughing)

1742
02:00:59,144 --> 02:01:01,521
G.W., you are a ruffian.

1743
02:01:02,105 --> 02:01:04,316
Cuthbert, you are right.

1744
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:06,310
(Crowd laughing)

1745
02:01:13,575 --> 02:01:16,078
Well, what kind of a family
is that?

1746
02:01:17,829 --> 02:01:19,122
The best!

1747
02:01:19,414 --> 02:01:20,999
And dangerous, fella.

1748
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:26,296
AGARD: Well, what happened?
Who won the race?

1749
02:01:26,922 --> 02:01:29,841
BEN: Who cares, Agard?
History's being made.

1750
02:01:49,069 --> 02:01:50,153
Yes, Rufus?

1751
02:01:50,278 --> 02:01:53,740
I regret to inform you I've changed
my mind about matrimony.

1752
02:01:55,534 --> 02:01:57,119
Rufus!

1753
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,139
LEM: Hey! Mrs. McLintock!

1754
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:30,130
Kath...

1755
02:02:31,278 --> 02:02:32,654
Katherine!

1756
02:02:32,946 --> 02:02:36,533
G.W: Keep them out of here.
JAKE: Everybody out!

1757
02:03:01,224 --> 02:03:03,685
Looks like G.W.'s buying out
the whole store.

1758
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:05,854
I'm afraid you're right.

1759
02:03:12,444 --> 02:03:14,863
Crummy family! Crummy family!

1760
02:03:29,294 --> 02:03:30,462
G.W!

1761
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:36,460
(Kate screams)

1762
02:03:37,552 --> 02:03:39,763
KATE: Oh, G.W, G.W!

1763
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:43,760
Oh, oh, G.W, G.W!

1764
02:03:44,810 --> 02:03:47,040
Aah!

1765
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:53,540
(Laughing)

1766
02:03:53,735 --> 02:03:57,364
Oh, Mrs. McLintock, you're all wet!
- Am I? Try it!

1767
02:04:06,665 --> 02:04:08,291
Wrong woman, G.W.

1768
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:10,502
Oh, pardon me.

1769
02:04:29,604 --> 02:04:32,440
Mrs. McLintock,
you setting a new style?

1770
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:33,950
Uh!

1771
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:42,610
Shhh!

1772
02:04:52,168 --> 02:04:55,380
Mr. McLintock! In here!

1773
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:22,949
If I ever get through this humiliation,
you will rue the day you ever met me!

1774
02:05:23,074 --> 02:05:25,869
Oh, bellyache and fight all you want.
It won't do you any good.

1775
02:05:25,994 --> 02:05:28,872
You've been digging those burrs
into me for two years.

1776
02:05:28,997 --> 02:05:31,666
Now, you're going to get
your comeuppance.

1777
02:05:32,041 --> 02:05:33,126
Thanks.

1778
02:05:33,620 --> 02:05:35,020
(Kate screaming)

1779
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:37,881
My father would be proud of you!

1780
02:05:38,381 --> 02:05:40,300
Then I'll make him prouder.

1781
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:43,000
(Screams)

1782
02:05:45,722 --> 02:05:46,973
Stop it! 
Aah!

1783
02:05:50,518 --> 02:05:52,854
G.W: Keep it.
You may need it.

1784
02:05:53,104 --> 02:05:54,981
Now get your divorce.

1785
02:05:55,010 --> 02:05:55,980
Oh!

1786
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:57,980
Oooh!

1787
02:05:58,276 --> 02:06:01,196
- Home! Don't spare the horse.
- Home? Are you...

1788
02:06:01,321 --> 02:06:02,405
You heard me.

1789
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:05,283
KATE: Don't think you're going
to get rid of me that easy.

1790
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:06,450
Yah!

1791
02:06:29,265 --> 02:06:31,643
G.W: No more living in the capital?
KATE: No.

1792
02:06:31,768 --> 02:06:34,521
G.W: No more Newport in season?
KATE: Nope.

1793
02:06:34,771 --> 02:06:37,649
G.W: No more dancing
at the Governor's Ball?

1794
02:06:37,774 --> 02:06:39,108
KATE: No, G.W.

1795
02:06:39,234 --> 02:06:40,693
G.W: Happy days!

1796
02:06:42,987 --> 02:06:46,241
KATE: 310 times,
without a miss.

1797
02:06:47,533 --> 02:06:49,077
That's a record.
