1
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,810
" Leviathan Smiles "

2
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,120
"The latest news"

3
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,870
I fail to understand, if I who am most effect am not disturbed, why you should be

4
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,870
Perhaps I'm disturbed by a reason different from what you believe

5
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,400
Forgive me then for believing the one you've given

6
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,550
I disapprove of changing from day to day when the school is to be relocated

7
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,990
Speak to the theater people then

8
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,020
What disturbs me is your accepting the uncertainty without quarrel

9
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,000
For whatever reason, the theater people keep deferring their moving in

10
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:21,420
I don't want the children to feel they're leaving vacant what has been their place of education

11
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:23,851
I want them to leave it as a place with new life

12
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,784
Fine, Martha

13
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,359
What good would quarreling with them do?

14
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:27,040
Fine

15
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,962
It seems you waked intent we quarrel

16
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:34,600
Nor, may I say, claiming you were pleased with the outcome of your meeting with the other men of the camp,

17
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:37,521
did you retire last night with your customary sweetness

18
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:41,492
Do please then forgive me, for Christ's sake

19
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:50,191
Do please forgive me

20
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:03,412
Mornin'

21
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:08,950
How did Hearst take the letter?

22
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:11,073
I don't know. Is the paper even out yet?

23
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,913
Guess you don't fuckin' know much. Do you, Sol?

24
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,282
I guess I don't

25
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,431
You want to fight?

26
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,423
Whoo! Whoo

27
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,480
Hold on! Whoa!

28
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,452
Road agents! Ambushed us a couple of miles out!

29
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:46,452
Anyone hurt ?

30
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,942
Cocksucker dropped a tree across the road

31
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:52,491
We just come up on it and they started shootin' from the fuckin' ridgeline

32
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:55,062
Would have lost the strongbox sure, Sheriff,

33
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:58,413
not for them there that laid down rifle fire as covered us

34
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:01,570
Whoo! Fuck me! Holy fuck

35
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:03,511
Holy fuck, right, Wyatt?

36
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,770
I'd like to buy you both a fucking drink

37
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,610
That's a big fucking yes from the both of us

38
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:09,972
You hit anyone?

39
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:12,492
No, we were just trying to drive 'em off, Sheriff

40
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:13,922
How many were there?

41
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:15,590
Two or three

42
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:18,132
I heard one of 'em shout like you winged 'em

43
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,953
They was dodging behind stumps and making for cover

44
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:20,921
Hey!

45
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:25,491
Why don't you go in there and get drunk with them, let the Sheriff and I finish out talk?

46
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:27,201
All right

47
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,633
Little brother's got me for a hero

48
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:37,102
What's your name?

49
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:40,510
I'm Wyatt, and going in there to get drunk is Morgan -- Earp

50
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:45,982
I was a lawman in Dodge City, before that in Wichita

51
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:48,590
But I ain't looking for none of that here

52
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,023
What are you looking for?

53
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,261
We got a timber lease

54
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:52,461
You and your brother?

55
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:57,143
What's your name?

56
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,613
Seth Bullock

57
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:01,011
How do you do?

58
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:03,970
There is a fella that wants to buy you a drink.

59
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:06,661
Over at the Gem

60
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:07,800
All right

61
00:06:11,027 --> 00:06:15,062
Shall I authorize a watering and feeding of these gentlemen's horses, Sheriff?

62
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:20,740
As Mayor? As a gesture from the camp?

63
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:29,502
One at a time…lest they drag you to a deserved demise

64
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,442
Ugh, fuck!

65
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:45,183
It's me, Jane. If you want the bed, I'm leaving

66
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:49,192
Don't go nowhere on my account. I'm a fuckin' floor sleeper anyway

67
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,180
Wanna find fruit for the schoolchildren's morning snack

68
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:58,283
Uh, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up. I'll get the hell out of here

69
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:02,962
Why not stay?

70
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:06,040
I got errands all morning myself

71
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,342
If you just heard me fart, excuse me

72
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,652
Will you come back later?

73
00:07:23,386 --> 00:07:27,482
Uh…Maybe, maybe

74
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:33,173
It's heads or tails where any fuckin' day will take me

75
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:55,461
I'll not have vile affections or uncleanness on these premises! Find my specific meaning at Romans I:24 through 6-

76
00:07:56,137 --> 00:08:01,830
Fuck yourself with a fist punch up your ass, today, at the present moment

77
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:07,351
I gotta go

78
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,900
I'm moving outta that fucking place

79
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,890
Not me. Not me. I never fuckin' moved in

80
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:18,972
And verses following

81
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:33,961
Don't think you was offered a job here last night

82
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:38,021
Gauging the fucking level you'd fucking presume to was all that was

83
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:50,083
Maybe you declined 'cause you thought you ought to be partners in the fuckin' business,

84
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:56,552
name on the signage like a human's or God hadn't set man apart from the fucking beasts!

85
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:02,152
I got an errand, then I'm going to San Francisco

86
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:06,153
We will never be equal, sign or fucking no

87
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:12,463
And if I agreed to your name on the signage, we would know the fucking truth still

88
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:18,300
Fucking Nigger Bastard! 

89
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,101
Assuming  to leave without my consent

90
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,273
Not without a fucking saddle, he won't

91
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:42,493
Not if I hide his fucking saddle till he reveals fucking Hostetler's nigger voodoo ciphering methods

92
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:51,262
So accounts ain't constantly to be carried around in the man's mind till he lives in terror of taking a drink!

93
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,531
Implying what by that fucking lordly look?

94
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:11,900
That he'll outflank my tactics buying a new fucking saddle?

95
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:25,400
Then I don't suppose you'll mind the improved fucking strategy involves you coming unshod behind

96
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:26,830
Now give me a fucking hoof

97
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:31,800
Yeah. There we go

98
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:39,961
That's right

99
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:48,240
Harp and fucking criticize until there's a fucking solution in the offing,

100
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,892
and then become fucking obstinate

101
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:57,623
Now, for the last fucking time, give me a fucking hoof

102
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,142
Come sneaking up like an Injun

103
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:12,151
Can't wait on your boy no longer, Miss Lady

104
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,611
Bow on that money is the same one you tied

105
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,420
I'm grateful you waited on him as long as you did

106
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:22,981
It ain't being none of my business gonna stop me from asking how your boy's talk with Hearst went

107
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:27,000
Odell gonna meet up with in New York City with a man works for Mr. Hearst

108
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:28,773
Go back with him to Liberia

109
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,082
Ah

110
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:35,642
Odell say if Mr. Hearst wanted, he'd harm him here, get to see the hurt he done

111
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,382
Well, your water broke open a damn smart nigger, didn't it, Aunt Lou?

112
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,012
You think there's sense to that?

113
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:44,672
More than I've made since I've learned to talk

114
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,752
No place I guess you can hide a child from danger

115
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:53,462
If I knew, I'd keep that spot for myself

116
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:55,770
And can I fix you something to take away?

117
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,613
Something with meat and heat to it

118
00:11:57,886 --> 00:11:59,042
Come on, stand next to me

119
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:00,870
Here, let me get that for you

120
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:01,931
Thank you, Sir

121
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:12,793
Myself  and him over there, my strong right arm, along with Tom Nuttall that runs the Saloon No. 10,

122
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:14,813
was the first operators in this here camp

123
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:15,722
So…

124
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:20,672
Turned the first card, sold the first booze and snatch

125
00:12:21,237 --> 00:12:26,831
Road agents, story goes, don't work these hills but by my leave

126
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:31,260
Which if that's true, explains why I'm fucking interested in what you're telling

127
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,010
So…

128
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:33,090
So…

129
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:35,820
go the fuck ahead and tell me then

130
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:43,342
Me and my brother happened along and we balked some unknown parties who was having a few shots at the stage

131
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:46,042
That's all

132
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:53,831
Ears flat back to the head, nose without boils, fucking modest

133
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:57,090
A proper hero, Dan. How many unknown parties?

134
00:12:58,158 --> 00:12:59,820
Uh, two or maybe three

135
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:01,321
At what remove from you?

136
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:02,652
A hundred feet and more

137
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:03,802
Describe 'em

138
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:06,333
Nah, they broke off

139
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:07,651
We returned fire

140
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:08,880
Describe 'em

141
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,373
My meaning would be them firing, I didn't get a good fucking look at them

142
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:20,661
I'd also say you're fucking free with your reprehending tone

143
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:31,531
Drink?

144
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:32,791
All right

145
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,704
My opinion, may come out of vanity, your tale is full of shit

146
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:52,579
I say, or else I'd have known of 'em, there was no road agents

147
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:59,613
I say…to make a hero's entrance into camp, you and your friend kicked up dust,

148
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,111
whooped and hollered and played all the parts yourselves

149
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,471
Who is that with you?

150
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:08,542
It's my brother. 

151
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:12,953
This was my idea

152
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,193
Any others? Not brothers, ideas

153
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,841
how to pass your time in camp

154
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:23,611
I got a timber lease to work

155
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:24,481
Come by how?

156
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,143
Cards, last night in Custer City

157
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:37,240
Small chance that you want to explore options to working your lease,

158
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,342
anyone hires your gun, you report to me

159
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:40,861
I'll double what they're paying you

160
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:45,271
But your story ought be true, you understand?

161
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:55,151
I'll test the sense of it, that knows more of this place and I guess every other than you do

162
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:06,821
If you choose to fell the timber, axes, wedges', block and tackle Sheriff has at the hardware store

163
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,152
All right

164
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,661
You figure Hearst will take a run at him?

165
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,211
Hmm

166
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:45,491
Good cooking, big-hearted fat lady presiding over my rest, I wouldn't be headed for San Francisco

167
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:50,900
She'd probably know what I'm talking about

168
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,333
how the wicked live

169
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:57,891
And are always at fucking ease

170
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,863
Or just plain drunk before noon

171
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:28,090
Wyatt

172
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,392
Wyatt, this here's Jen, 

173
00:16:32,786 --> 00:16:35,873
whose sister turns out the both of us have knowed Mary Bess 

174
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:38,393
from the Yellow Bird in Gunnison

175
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:40,452
Even prettier

176
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:43,100
I was speaking to Jen of that $11…

177
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,140
We got to go acquire them tools

178
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:48,093
…That I loaned her sister

179
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:52,433
We was working out the forgiveness of the debt

180
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,720
Well you can work out her forgiveness later

181
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,570
I thought we was gonna capitalize on the good will we created

182
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:21,511
Seeing to our fucking capitalizing means more than getting your end wet

183
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,880
Here. This will buy the tools to cut our lumber

184
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,843
What are you going to do?

185
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,812
The next fucking step of my plan

186
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,212
To capitalize?

187
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:40,850
You go ahead down to that hardware place

188
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:42,671
I can see to the tree cutting and more

189
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:44,492
Well only start with seeing to the trees

190
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:45,510
Or don't you think I'm able?

191
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,123
Jesus Christ, Morgan

192
00:17:49,185 --> 00:17:50,491
Now probably I'll be in this place

193
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:52,100
Well, what did he want upstairs?

194
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,460
You ain't got time for me to get into that

195
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:08,102
Morning!

196
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:09,710
Good  morning, Mr. Hearst

197
00:18:11,978 --> 00:18:14,801
Very constructive reminder in this morning's edition

198
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,281
12 days to the election

199
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:22,932
Will you continue to show that calendar, uh, 11, 10 days, so on?

200
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,822
Assuming my press stays intact

201
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:32,842
Thanks, too, for publishing Sheriff Bullock's letter of condolence to the family of that murdered worker of mine

202
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,330
Oh, you're welcome

203
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:36,923
I suppose I should have written them myself

204
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,771
I'd  not presumed to suppose in that regard, Mr. Hearst, one way or another

205
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:45,662
Was the Sheriff's making his letter part of the public record meant to embarrass or reproach me?

206
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:47,450
I'd not suppose in that connection either

207
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,101
I'm to take you for majestically neutral?

208
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:57,872
I'd make the less exalted claim, as a journalist, of keeping my opinions to myself

209
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,912
You are less majestically neutral than-

210
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:03,580
than cloaking your cowardice in principle?

211
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,990
I can only answer perhaps, Mr. Hearst

212
00:19:11,758 --> 00:19:14,431
Events have not yet disclosed to me all that I am

213
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:17,793
Those kind of events could be in the weather, Merrick

214
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:20,623
You might have a second calendar for them

215
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,920
The fella all those hats was up in the air about, Mr. T

216
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:39,733
Ah

217
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:43,283
Claims he drove off them road agents

218
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:51,323
Elrod Yulaham from Galena, Illinois

219
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:53,382
Uh, afraid not

220
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:58,180
Oh, I see now. You got more flare about the nostrils than Elrod

221
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,873
Uh, this here Gentleman's a hero, Mr. Tolliver

222
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:05,572
Thwarted a band of brigands attacking the stage out of Cheyenne

223
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:06,921
Three, Craps

224
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:10,372
Don't levy the man's wager, Leon

225
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,383
His throw got queered by Con's chatter

226
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:14,783
Last was no roll

227
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:16,261
Cy Tolliver, Sir

228
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:19,441
It's a honor to meet you. Thanks in the name of us all

229
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:21,532
Aw, we just happened to happen by

230
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:24,593
That's the first I hear of a we

231
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:27,701
Six is the point. Point six

232
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,672
yeah, well, I come into camp with my brother

233
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:32,212
Who would be where at this present juncture?

234
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:34,703
Well, we acquired a timber lease

235
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,691
He's out buying tools for us to work it

236
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:38,633
Tools to work a timber lease

237
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,941
I guess you're even more a hero, guns being out of your line

238
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:49,713
I didn't call them a fully foreign subject now

239
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,093
I see

240
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:54,321
I see

241
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:57,743
Eight. Point six

242
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:59,630
Pay the man, Leon

243
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:03,052
But I didn't make my point

244
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:06,142
You did to me

245
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:16,331
We ought try…to cross the road…today

246
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,073
The thoroughfare's a menace

247
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:26,680
Ruts, sinkholes…

248
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:28,083
quick slimes

249
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:50,453
You're the producer, Jack

250
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,341
You'll manage

251
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:22,182
Forgive my presumption, Sir

252
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:26,753
Have you lanceolate pains hereabouts?

253
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:29,303
Yes

254
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:36,922
Intermittent, but sudden, sharp in the onset, occasioned by a tilt of a shoulder, a shift of weight?

255
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,060
I may try ice-water dousing

256
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:42,141
Ah

257
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:45,380
A german Doctor in Viginia City urged me to it

258
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:51,243
A vogue, if you would permit me to say, now quite exploded,

259
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:54,780
even recognized as possibly harmful

260
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:56,403
Really?

261
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:57,212
Y eah

262
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:04,133
The cold causing too rapid and painful a contraction of muscles already knotted in spasm

263
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:05,191
I see

264
00:23:05,788 --> 00:23:14,503
I am aware of a certain technique by whose virtue I was gradually and by degrees relieved of a similar suffering of my own

265
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:15,773
You are?

266
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:24,532
Blessed by my pain's entire remission for 15 years, 1 month and 3 days

267
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:27,752
I dread the prospect of ice-water dousing

268
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:31,732
Taught me by a former [Odabashi] of the Turkish artillery,[grade d'officier supérieur, du corps d'élite des "Janissaries" au service de l'empire Ottoman]

269
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:38,273
come himself to be afflicted through chronic lifting of cast-iron cannonballs

270
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:42,620
Can you help me…who does not know your name?

271
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:43,872
John Langrishe, Sir

272
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:49,330
Ah, permit me to say you are known to me

273
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:49,953
George Hearst

274
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:51,260
Yes. 

275
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:53,442
Oh, yes

276
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,640
Would later today be convenient to start, George Hearst?

277
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:01,613
Indeed

278
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,203
Better today?

279
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:26,241
No better

280
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,871
Nor will be to take him any day to come

281
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:34,000
Be good enough to inform the artisans they will not be renovating after recess at the school

282
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,413
Prepare his transport

283
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:39,010
We are going to show him the theater

284
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:41,540
Will you help me?

285
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,260
I've other fucking business

286
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:54,792
Seven out

287
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:58,012
Motherless whore

288
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:07,060
Speaking against the establishment's interests, you might leave with a rosier outlook still holding some of our money

289
00:25:29,218 --> 00:25:30,421
Big winner on the day

290
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:36,572
Well, those appear to have propagated

291
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:45,033
He worsens, Mrs. Bullock, never to improve, I'm afraid

292
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:46,911
I'm very sorry, Mr. Langrishe

293
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:50,551
Hope having postponed the old actor's visit to what will be our theater,

294
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:55,110
its abandonment now argues the visit's urgent execution

295
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:55,663
I understand

296
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,200
Forcing this directness upon me

297
00:25:57,688 --> 00:26:01,492
When, Mrs. Bullock, today, will your classes stand in recess?

298
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,601
How soon could you have him here?

299
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:10,211
The logistics of his transport and the histrionics of his porter may not make it till late this afternoon

300
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:12,352
I'll cancel the session right after the recess

301
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:13,520
Bless you

302
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,102
And thanks

303
00:26:19,918 --> 00:26:21,960
Oh. Beautiful

304
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:28,913
I got ammunition left

305
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:29,930
I see that

306
00:26:32,877 --> 00:26:34,393
I didn't order any shotgun

307
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:40,093
I'm doing you the courtesy of allowing you not to think I'm as stupid as evidently you believe

308
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,280
that girl off who you tore that piece of pussy off of is

309
00:26:44,015 --> 00:26:45,601
The girl's sister owed me money

310
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:48,280
From the Yellowbird in Gunnison

311
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:52,441
Well, Jen claims you worked that information from her

312
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:53,760
That her sister owed me money?

313
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,960
Yeah

314
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:58,830
Well, did she tell you how I did it?'Cause I'd sure like to remember for the next time I'm short

315
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,811
Worked it from her at this very bar in idle chatter

316
00:27:02,127 --> 00:27:10,231
having a sister who whored at the Yellowbird in Gunnison, and only then alleged the supposed owed $11

317
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,953
How long you been wearing shoes, counselor?

318
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,723
Did you fuck off the full 11?

319
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:22,243
She claims $5 was owed, but my inkling is the right total is seven

320
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:43,821
Thanks

321
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:44,741
Mm-hm. 

322
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:48,981
Where are the tools, Morgan?

323
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:51,882
That is a story in itself

324
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,700
You say it weren't an ass fuck, I believe you

325
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:08,101
You buying those Goddamned tools, or not?

326
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:11,003
I wouldn't have chose them not meaning to buy

327
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:19,463
As opposed to leaving chosen goods piled in the middle of the fucking store for every other piece of business to be conducted over and around

328
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:24,372
It's customary to stand by till the transaction's finished

329
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:26,711
I was called elsewhere

330
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:29,461
Elsewhere meaning the Gem

331
00:28:29,996 --> 00:28:31,993
You wouldn't be doubting my brother's word?

332
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:45,642
Pay for the tools and remove them, and I'll cease to doubt your ability to do so

333
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:49,721
How's that?

334
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,070
There is no losing in a match like that, Mr. Hearst

335
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:15,571
Never been much for draws

336
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:16,992
Well, I-I

337
00:29:17,126 --> 00:29:19,980
I meant to say, let the matter be joined aright,

338
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,341
whether Bullock or this gunsel stood at the finish, there's no losing in it for you

339
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:26,522
What  does "joined aright" mean?

340
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:35,071
Say Bullock was first provoked out the public eye, so his throwing down in public seemed…overquick

341
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:39,871
There's all kinds of implications to that, legal and political too

342
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:44,463
Have you taken steps to join this matter aright?

343
00:29:44,877 --> 00:29:49,070
Only steps I took so far, Mr. Hearst, was to bring me into your presence

344
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:53,422
As to what steps will be required if you give the go-ahead,

345
00:29:55,185 --> 00:30:01,371
easy as the Sheriff sparks, and cocky look as his kid wears, the number should be few

346
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:08,861
I would suggest, to keep you fucking protected, that the kid should think I'm at the helm

347
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,290
Very circumspect. Very considerate

348
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:23,093
There are the blankets

349
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,031
Oh, there they are

350
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:29,781
You are excused by age and illness

351
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,630
I am simply stupid

352
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:33,662
Oh, no

353
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:37,062
At a minimum, unforgivably forgetful

354
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:42,072
My dear boy, we are here now

355
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:46,130
You and I and the blankets

356
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:48,313
Yes, yes. Um-

357
00:30:51,618 --> 00:30:55,860
I wonder where the chair would be in which I'm to be transported

358
00:30:56,335 --> 00:31:01,450
Oh that the Countess and Claudia should be wheeling across the thoroughfare even as we speak

359
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,553
We shall swaddle you like the baby Jesus

360
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:32,613
making the most simple and economical of transactions to transfer to you the Countess and Claudia's chair once they arrive

361
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:35,902
All right. All right

362
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:40,781
Is he dying? Is he dead?

363
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:44,381
He's in a bad fucking way

364
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,280
Here. Take that for his care and burying

365
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:54,970
Let me get my fucking horse past

366
00:31:56,245 --> 00:32:00,992
And let the bank know, someone don't take over this place, that loan they made Steve is going bad

367
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:02,102
Why don't you tell them?

368
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,470
'Cause I'm a nigger, Doc, that don't care what stands or falls

369
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:06,131
Hostetler was too.

370
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:07,710
Hostetler was taller than me

371
00:32:13,818 --> 00:32:17,731
Fuck you, Steve. Fuck you, Hostetler

372
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,060
And fuck you too!

373
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:29,273
I can ask Jane Cannary to…see to keeping him comfortable

374
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:33,193
See to her bringing back a bottle while you're at it

375
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:37,442
I'll linger, look to these animals till the bank sends someone over

376
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,812
That chair is hotel property

377
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:52,363
I will deal with the bathhouse administrator, believe you me

378
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:56,310
Shoo! Shoo!

379
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:58,382
Where have you been?

380
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:01,090
Pushing this contraption through the muck

381
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,012
To the bathhouse, it was on loan

382
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:07,240
Wait till you see what they do there

383
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,551
Stay right there, Bellegarde. We're already knee-deep in shit

384
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:15,372
Are those assholes working for you?

385
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,232
Those heros that saved the stage?

386
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:19,612
That Dority collected

387
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:23,851
Once he confessed to the stretch I put the one on a fucking string

388
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:31,703
$200 in merchandise in the middle of our store like an interrupted shit

389
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,783
Commerce. Every hump above ground's your master

390
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,953
Letter was a fucking mistake

391
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:39,640
No

392
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,343
I'm not waiting on Hearst, I'll tell you that right now

393
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:48,212
I am not on his fucking timetable, or at his fucking beck and call

394
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:51,073
Yeah

395
00:33:51,908 --> 00:33:53,173
A.W. Merrick, Al

396
00:33:53,486 --> 00:33:55,941
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph

397
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:58,350
Is Sheriff Bullock inside?

398
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:04,710
Only briefly. He's out of sorts and going downstairs for a blowjob

399
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:08,822
Come in for fuck's sake!

400
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,662
Telegram for Sheriff Bullock

401
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:20,581
What reaction to your publication of Bullock's letter?

402
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:24,483
The great man himself took, um, umbrage

403
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:29,332
It was not a mistake, and we are waiting on Hearst

404
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:32,403
Unless you think those two assholes are his response

405
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:38,342
Not likely

406
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:50,253
Uh, the Sheriff is going for blowjob?

407
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:08,492
Now having paid, may we leave our tools here till we go out tomorrow to our lease?

408
00:35:09,636 --> 00:35:10,552
I've had a wire…

409
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,901
says your statement is true, far as having worked as a lawman

410
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:23,422
Not asking why you put the work aside, I'll say only some that do find themselves ready and uniquely able to work the other side of the street

411
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:28,452
Some do that

412
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,562
I took the badge off myself once…

413
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:50,360
without losing my impulse to beat on certain types

414
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:56,590
No, that seems never to go

415
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:10,242
Not now!

416
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:12,510
Could I come back soon then, Mr. Hearst?

417
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:13,893
God damn it

418
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:16,862
Come in Aunt Lou. Come in now

419
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,242
Boots are in the corner

420
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,992
I'd pay a man three weeks of my wages, Mr. Hearst

421
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:30,130
Rode quick to catch my son and give him this from his Mama

422
00:36:30,716 --> 00:36:32,590
Searched and searched before he left

423
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,553
Come to find it with him gone

424
00:36:37,808 --> 00:36:38,820
Lovely garnet

425
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:42,910
Does seem a moral law we find what we seek only tardily

426
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:44,602
Would you send somebody, Sir?

427
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:56,383
My imagination resists the approach, in that however quickly he might catch Odell, until he did,

428
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:59,552
the man would know he rode in the service of a colored person

429
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:05,582
I'd suggest, having packed the brooch carefully and securely, we ship it to New York,

430
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:09,421
where my man Fitzpatrick can give it to your son when he arrives

431
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:12,902
All right

432
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:22,171
Are you afraid that by his not receiving today the token of your love, something untoward might befall Odell?

433
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,392
Are you superstitious that way, Aunt Lou?

434
00:37:34,037 --> 00:37:36,551
Thanks for seeing to those. It's the reason I thought you'd knocked

435
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:51,253
Maybe we should head out for the lease

436
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:55,670
Well, now has the sun rose since last I looked?

437
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:58,953
Or more than you let on previous, do you even know the path we're going?

438
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,153
No, I do not fucking know

439
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:08,513
Second look, he don't seem such a bad sort, that fucking Sheriff

440
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:12,850
Maybe we ought to be fucking deputies, work our lease on the fucking side

441
00:38:13,497 --> 00:38:15,422
Well, did you hear him offer us work?

442
00:38:16,005 --> 00:38:17,482
Well, then let's kill him and take his job

443
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:23,402
On the other hand, here is a man who might be about to

444
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:26,893
The one that has a plan for you that factors into yours for us?

445
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:30,262
Do no fucking turn around, Morgan

446
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:31,811
I thought he didn't show up

447
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:37,132
Well, well. This the hero brother I heard about?

448
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:39,840
This is him, Morgan Earp. 

449
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:44,523
Morgan, meet Mr. Tolliver who operates the joint

450
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:45,602
How do you do, Morgan?

451
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,080
How do you do? What a beautiful fucking joint

452
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:49,782
Well, we like to think so

453
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,340
Come on, you fucknut

454
00:39:00,257 --> 00:39:06,311
Without a day's education, medical or otherwise, I vouchsafe this fucking truth:

455
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:11,271
Those as don't eat without exception fail to survive

456
00:39:18,116 --> 00:39:18,943
Fuck ya

457
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:24,832
He's all yours

458
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:27,780
Thanks for your help

459
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:29,763
Yup

460
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,142
You heard the lady, Steve. 

461
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,653
Them that goes on have got to fucking eat

462
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:49,280
Cocksucker

463
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,140
Cocksucker

464
00:39:55,266 --> 00:40:03,742
Do for me, Mr. Hearst, and much more for yourself, this one important thing

465
00:40:05,258 --> 00:40:08,871
Breathe, Sir. 

466
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:12,171
Breathe deeply, 

467
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:19,172
hungrily, as if your life depended on it

468
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:23,660
And yet slowly! 

469
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:30,662
As with the rhythm of the waves of the sea

470
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:46,342
The while, Mr. Hearst, allowing influx of my motion's heat

471
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:51,210
Do you begin to feel it, man?

472
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:54,193
I think so

473
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:55,022
Hmm?

474
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,320
I said I think so

475
00:40:57,445 --> 00:41:01,823
Then too…begin to feel this: 

476
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:12,283
One towards the neck and one towards the coccyx

477
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:16,702
Ooh!

478
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:17,693
What?

479
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:18,882
My God!

480
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:19,890
Are you all right?

481
00:41:20,206 --> 00:41:21,723
I am. How are you?

482
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:22,682
Ah

483
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,732
Some release in tension?

484
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:25,690
Ja

485
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:27,430
Yes

486
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:30,613
Yes, by God

487
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,642
Is the pain diminished in some measure?

488
00:41:34,065 --> 00:41:34,712
It is

489
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:51,960
Now lie still, Sir. As your nodals…

490
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:54,702
settle to the adjustment

491
00:41:55,856 --> 00:41:57,380
Try to sleep

492
00:41:57,797 --> 00:41:59,653
I don't want to sleep. I'm waiting for something

493
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:02,710
Very well, please yourself

494
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,310
Second look, she may have decided it didn't suit

495
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:25,050
This hasn't said…anything yet to spare my feelings

496
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:27,912
I don't believe Mrs. Bullock's that sort

497
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:32,360
I believe them theater people not moving in yet,

498
00:42:32,737 --> 00:42:41,593
she feels no call to disrupt her education activities by moving the children out yet from the Chez Amie into this place here

499
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:45,903
In other words, exactly what she said

500
00:42:47,535 --> 00:42:52,050
Does it trouble you, keeping watch on a dark place?

501
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:53,933
No, ma'am, it does not. 

502
00:42:56,345 --> 00:43:00,191
Especially when I know there's light coming to it

503
00:43:51,356 --> 00:43:52,701
One sorry-ass…

504
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:57,872
shit eating cocksucker

Claudia and the Countess have embroidered the tabs in gold: Thalia and Melpomene

The curtain rises. The stage is set before us

Dost thou know Dover? [Shakespeare, The Tragedy of King Lear, Act IV sc. 1]

514
00:44:56,857 --> 00:45:05,140
There is a cliff whose high unbending head looks fearfully on the confined deep

515
00:45:07,216 --> 00:45:12,222
Bring me but to the brim of it, and from that place…

Here's the fly tower

If you mount up, take firm a rail in each hand

I'll boost your bum, darling

Here's the place

How fearful and dizzy it is to cast one's eyes so low

522
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:16,371
Set me where you stand. Let go my hand

We'll see to him now

00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,993
Winner 10! 10 as hard as they come

529
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:42,872
That is my big brother, who I'm going to be assisting on some very important business for the man you work for,

530
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:46,933
and for whom I may put in a good word for you depending on how good you are to me

531
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:50,563
You seem blue, Jack

532
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:57,271
That old actor I spoke of … passed

533
00:47:58,606 --> 00:47:59,551
Sorry

534
00:48:00,148 --> 00:48:06,353
Wrapped like a mummy in blankets, drowning in his own fluids

535
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:21,863
Perhaps, Al, given the sleigh ride which ensues, the best connection to leviathan may not be by harpoon

536
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:23,490
Explain yourself

537
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:25,762
I mean the inimical Mr. Hearst--

538
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:34,363
suffering with discomfort at his back, the wiles of a bullshitter such as oneself may have use as a feint to occupy him

539
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:35,350
How?

540
00:48:36,115 --> 00:48:47,871
Campaign towards relief protracted, punctuated by Pentecostal whoops and manual pushes and prods while invoking arcane authorities

541
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:55,493
the host's unhealthy soul reliable to sustain his symptoms

542
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:22,923
You were good to try a net on that cocksucker, Jack, on such a sorry day

543
00:49:27,518 --> 00:49:33,043
Mr. Hearst! Are we still in a state of respite?

544
00:49:35,618 --> 00:49:39,440
The odd twinge, Mr. Langrishe, but overall much improved

545
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:43,341
A winning skirmish in a long campaign!

546
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:49,451
Mr. Swearengen

547
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:50,922
Mr. Hearst

548
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:53,870
Old friends!

549
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:01,662
Don't imbibe overmuch the evening chill

550
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:04,970
Waiting for something

551
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:21,302
It appears the theater people's moving in was delayed by the illness of one of their troupe, who today, I believe, has died

552
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:24,422
So they should be moving in very shortly

553
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:28,050
Thank you for telling me

554
00:50:33,257 --> 00:50:34,071
Without quarrel

555
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:49,571
And you acknowledge your lack of sweetness on retiring last evening?

556
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:57,321
I do, being uneasy about my letter's publication

557
00:50:58,217 --> 00:50:59,643
And Mr. Hearst's reaction

558
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:06,462
Perhaps tonight will be twice as sweet

559
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:16,741
Sweet mother of Jesus

560
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:32,093
Take them amateurs off the fucking sugar tit

561
00:51:32,658 --> 00:51:34,882
Mr. Hearst brought the pros to town

562
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:40,150
Leviathan fucking smiles

563
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:43,733
Synchro : Nikou3131
