1
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,653
Sorry, Bullock.

2
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:23,269
You abide me beside you,
20 paces or so?

3
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,183
Yankton's man is among us.

4
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:36,432
Even under the circumstances...

5
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:40,807
he may try you to confirm we're allied.

6
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,137
If he does...

7
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,143
your nod would advance the cause.

8
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:49,594
All right.

9
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:10,599
Yeah, you fat fuck, you're alive.

10
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:14,974
Let me die.

11
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,130
What is that, "thank you" in whale talk?

12
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,421
- Drink this.
- No.

13
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,555
Drink it.

14
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:50,967
Get up, get the doc,
and tell him he's got a live one.

15
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:54,084
Tell him, too,
his rupture patient left here...

16
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:56,544
to convalesce at his own fucking place.

17
00:04:56,758 --> 00:05:00,502
You gave him a shoulder to lean on
as he was getting the fuck out.

18
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:12,206
Next time he opens his eyes, he's
gonna think he died and went to heaven.

19
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,103
Cocksucker!

20
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,978
Yeah, San Francisco cocksucker, Wu.
Your mortal fucking enemy.

21
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,600
- Swearengen.
- Wu.

22
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,099
Swearengen.

23
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,684
Yeah, I make these
as burnt-up whores...

24
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:08,102
that I smelt on the char this morning
with your San Francisco rival...

25
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:09,930
turning the fucking spit.

26
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:12,427
- Swearengen fucking knows.
- Swearengen know.

27
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:15,850
I know about the burnt-up whores,
I know about the San Francisco...

28
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,808
cocksucker setting a match to them.

29
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,762
Now, here's the part
you gotta listen to, Wu.

30
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:24,184
- Chung Kuo.
- Is "China."

31
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:27,598
- Chung Kuo, "China."
- Yeah, Chung Kuo, "China."

32
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:33,047
Celestial whores in the fire. What?
Their spirits are fucking...

33
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:35,713
nothing, if their bones
don't get back home? Is that it?

34
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:37,714
And do you come to me
to back your move...

35
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,762
against your
San Francisco cocksucker rival?

36
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:41,424
Am I getting
the fucking drift to you, Wu?

37
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,003
- Swearengen!
- Swearengen fucking gets it!

38
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:47,344
Swearengen doesn't give a fuck!

39
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:52,341
Back to Chinks' Alley, Wu.
Fall to your fucking prayers.

40
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,630
I can use the plate
if you want to leave that.

41
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:26,872
Why don't I back him?

42
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:30,754
'Cause Hearst is
in the other Chink's corner.

43
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,118
Meaning Wu has to lose.

44
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:38,285
Wouldn't be the worst thing.

45
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,290
Backing a loser to Hearst.

46
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:47,413
Let him pick me up from the canvas
after, dust me the fuck off.

47
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,404
I raise the great man's hand...

48
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,453
murmur, best as I can through split lips:

49
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:59,867
"Your man beat my man's balls off,
Mr Hearst."

50
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:05,413
But Hearst's Chink...

51
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:10,201
bossing that alley
ain't to my fucking taste.

52
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,490
So what if something delays
the battle of the Chinks?

53
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:20,820
Say, during that interval I get to show
my ass a few times to Mr Hearst.

54
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,529
Meanwhile, that pain in the balls,
Wu, is sketching up a storm...

55
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:26,532
and drawing fucking little pictures of
himself brandishing the lash...

56
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:30,231
driving from a delivery ship a quota
of Chinks to be blown to pieces...

57
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:32,529
by dynamite working
in the mines for Hearst...

58
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:37,521
at half the fee per Chink that Hearst
is paying the San Francisco cocksucker.

59
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:40,363
Now, by this time, Hearst
has seen my ass so many times...

60
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:42,237
he knows I'm no long-term threat.

61
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,608
So, some brief opposition
of our interests...

62
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:46,189
ain't gonna make him
feel like he needs...

63
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,481
to engage me in a death struggle,
say, by opposing local elections.

64
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:56,692
Those circumstances
we can risk backing Wu...

65
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:58,816
and the great man figures:

66
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,225
"I am damaged by neither outcome.

67
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:04,524
"Why not retire to a neutral corner...

68
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,098
"and test my import against the locals?"

69
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,431
What delays Wu going after
the other Chink?

70
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,937
- Or the other Chink going after Wu?
- That, too.

71
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:17,480
Well, if the other Chink can
be dissuaded, Wu, we can put on ice.

72
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,849
Well, how do we dissuade
the other Chink?

73
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:24,310
I suppose laying eyes on him
would be the first step.

74
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:31,885
My only question is,
push comes to shove...

75
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,970
wearing them Chinese dresses...

76
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:39,134
how well can you ladies fight?

77
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,932
You're staying, Adams.

78
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,764
Cheyenne and Black Hills
Telegraph Company.

79
00:10:53,266 --> 00:10:54,841
Telegrams for delivery.

80
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:58,795
Mr Blasanov. On our day of grief.

81
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:05,508
Our acquaintance
is established, Blasanov...

82
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:07,587
and for my part, our friendship.

83
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,504
- Thank you.
- You needn't announce yourself...

84
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,385
every morning, and your purpose.

85
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,091
May I suggest, as well, that rather than
you delivering your telegrams upstairs...

86
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:21,006
interrupting the rest, or secret
depravities, of well-armed guests...

87
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:23,749
I could distribute them
in these pigeonholes...

88
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:26,413
to be collected by the guests
at their leisure?

89
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:28,167
I am not permitted.

90
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:34,580
A man must put bread on his table,
Mr Blasanov, I well understand.

91
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,041
Suppose, to compensate you for lost
gratuities, I were to pay you $5 a day?

92
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:48,659
Cheyenne and Black Hills
Telegraph Company...

93
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:51,579
requires personal delivery by Blasanov.

94
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,832
I am not permitted.

95
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:03,621
Yet avarice is numbered among
the sins, and stupidity omitted.

96
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:08,407
- No Gem whores at the railings today.
- Why not?

97
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,822
Al won't permit them on the balcony.

98
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:14,076
He lets them on, they'll be leaping off.

99
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:18,203
Very dramatic we get,
at the passing of the fucking young.

100
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:20,405
Yesterday was a terrible day.

101
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,698
Do not even fucking ask me
to account for my coming here...

102
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:26,111
advising you how to answer Ellsworth.

103
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:30,785
You haven't changed your opinion,
have you, Trixie...

104
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:34,485
as to my accepting
Ellsworth's marriage proposal?

105
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,783
My new opinion is...

106
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:40,775
few choices, as are ours to make...

107
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:43,735
others should stay
the fuck out of the process.

108
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:51,109
Quiet like that since the boy's accident?

109
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,597
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph.
Telegram for Mr Wolcott.

110
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:32,309
- How are you today, Mr Blasanov?
- Thank you.

111
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:48,592
- Telegram for Mr Jarry.
- Yes, I am he.

112
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:51,050
Thank you.

113
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:11,758
You've packed your things.
Thrown them, it looks like.

114
00:14:13,973 --> 00:14:15,798
What is it you wish to say?

115
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:21,504
That I'd hope in the throes of this day
you'd not make any final decision.

116
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,011
I can't bear to stay.

117
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:34,373
The minister's here
to discuss the service.

118
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,753
Reverend.

119
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:48,164
Mrs Bullock, my deep sympathies...

120
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:50,959
which I conveyed
to your husband last evening.

121
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:52,370
Thank you.

122
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:56,997
You wish to discuss William's service.

123
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:02,000
I suggested to Mr Bullock that
we hold service in front of the house.

124
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,166
That would be fine.

125
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:05,577
As to the substance of the service...

126
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,877
do you wish psalms,
a reading, my words...

127
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:13,954
hymns, chosen speakers in memoriam,
a second reading...

128
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,710
- Let the service be brief.
- Yes.

129
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,079
Certainly.

130
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,951
Do you wish to provide me
a detail or two of William?

131
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,499
I don't want that.

132
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,331
Do you have a favourite reading?
Did he?

133
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:32,571
- You choose something.
- Certainly.

134
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,904
And you'll announce that
the burial is private?

135
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:36,111
I will.

136
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:43,492
Will there, then, be a passing-by
of the casket after the service?

137
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:44,858
No!

138
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:49,949
- Certainly.
- Thank you, Reverend.

139
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:33,106
My condolences, Sheriff.
My deepest sympathies.

140
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:36,772
The answer is yes, Commissioner.
What you wanna know.

141
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:40,024
Having to do with Mr Swearengen
speaking with your voice.

142
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:43,023
Yes. That's all, now.

143
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:46,806
My reluctance to intrude
nearly kept me from coming at all.

144
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:00,470
Mose Manuel made it through.

145
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,557
- Thank heavens.
- The doc fixed Con's rupture, too.

146
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,060
Go shoot some dope.

147
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:13,225
Thank you, sir.
It's been a hell of a trying evening.

148
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,974
I have a cheque for $50,000...

149
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:22,262
I'd like to cash with you.

150
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:26,423
I show that courtesy to people
who gamble in my joint.

151
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:29,051
I wish to afford you, Mr Tolliver,
a chance to show...

152
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:33,091
my colleagues in Yankton that you are
not blinded by parochial rivalry...

153
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:35,882
as to what the greater good requires.

154
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,252
You'd deliver the 50 to Swearengen?

155
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:43,676
Who'd no doubt prefer the cheque,
to have the bribe on record.

156
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:47,541
So, this ain't you just being a twitch...

157
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:50,503
who likes rubbing people's noses
in their losses.

158
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:54,918
Shall we transact our business
in the cage, Mr Tolliver...

159
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,749
where I was attacked the other day,
and you failed to come to my aid?

160
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:11,714
I see you made it
through the fucking night.

161
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,296
Jesus fucking Christ.

162
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,835
This is gonna be a pleasant fucking day,
them wailing and gnashing their teeth.

163
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,202
Will they be allowed
to pay their respects?

164
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:26,874
- By who?
- By you, most importantly, as always.

165
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:29,531
And should you,
in your greatness, consent...

166
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:31,866
will he let them in his fucking house?

167
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,369
I won't object...

168
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:37,708
but it's yours to keep them she-apes
from disgracing me.

169
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:41,371
As to Bullock's feelings,
get the Jew to find them out.

170
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,956
Should I ask about you also?

171
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:51,245
What the fuck
would I wanna go there for?

172
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:02,993
Shut the fuck up!

173
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:16,485
Hot!

174
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:18,522
Hot!

175
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:25,777
I mean I know what it's supposed to
be, but I ain't fucking used to it.

176
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,358
Well, maybe wait a little.

177
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,730
Yeah, I'll wait a little bit
before I fucking get in.

178
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,359
Did it ever occur to you strange...

179
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:39,772
bathing in a tub you've dirtied,
coming out thinking you're clean?

180
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,975
- You need a bath, Jane.
- And I'm gonna fucking take it!

181
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:47,188
I'm raising a general fucking question.

182
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,433
If you want boots different
from your regular...

183
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:54,808
No, I do not.
I will clean my fucking regular boots.

184
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:59,140
- Shouldn't you do that before your bath?
- No! Turn around!

185
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,060
Don't go!

186
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:14,472
Dumb fucking luck it must have been
me living this long...

187
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,802
without your fucking guidance.

188
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:18,886
I don't like new boots, either.

189
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:23,301
I ain't afraid of newness...

190
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,682
it's the blisters give me pause.

191
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:32,434
God, I burnt my fucking snatch!

192
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:37,096
- Or funerals.
- Or funerals, what?

193
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,346
Any more than I like new boots.

194
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:46,136
- I don't like funerals.
- I do! I do! I can't get to enough of them!

195
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,171
Trixie.

196
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,038
He'd have me ask, might the whores...

197
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,877
pay the dead boy their respects?

198
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:27,995
The service is outside the home.
All in the camp are welcome.

199
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:30,459
They'd be sure to keep to their place.

200
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:32,663
Why did you go to him?

201
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,415
Now, hold to this counter
as I reveal this, Mr Star.

202
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:45,494
I've lived most of my life a whore,
and as much as he's her misery...

203
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,207
the pimp's a whore's familiar.

204
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:52,664
So, the sudden strange or violent
draws her to him.

205
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,120
Not that I wouldn't learn another way.

206
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,371
- You look fucking mournful.
- Even more.

207
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,782
Sad day, gentlemen,
on which commerce must intrude.

208
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:10,863
Says who that it must?

209
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,116
Because of the death
of the Sheriff's son.

210
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:16,871
You need to ask,
you don't deserve an answer.

211
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:19,787
I should say
that even in his hour of grief...

212
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,242
Sheriff Bullock conveyed to me
his reliance on you as his proxy.

213
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:27,075
And, as his proxy...

214
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:31,563
I don't do business on the day
of my godson's passing.

215
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,903
I'm compelled to wonder,
Mr Swearengen...

216
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:40,146
if this show of grief is a pretext
to some other purpose.

217
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:46,941
What a type you must consort with...

218
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:50,564
that you not fear beating
for such an insult.

219
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:53,773
If Montana, for example...

220
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:56,772
had sweetened the terms
in annexing this camp...

221
00:22:56,862 --> 00:23:00,144
and you'd delay the closing
of our business not for piety...

222
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:02,274
but to pursue your other negotiations...

223
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,228
Leave here with your
sick fucking ghoulish thinking.

224
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,020
I'll have further instructions
within the day.

225
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:09,894
If not honour...

226
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:13,977
practicality dictates granting Yankton
further counter.

227
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,899
You come back here offering
one more dollar than that 50...

228
00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:19,767
you'll find yourself facedown
in the horseshit.

229
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:23,518
But you would entertain
enhancement of the offer...

230
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:25,599
other than cash?

231
00:23:26,356 --> 00:23:30,266
I do not discuss business
on this day. Silas.

232
00:23:31,188 --> 00:23:34,186
You're buying yourself
a fucking bum's rush, Commissioner.

233
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:37,352
When Mr Swearengen says go,
he means it.

234
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:39,392
All right. All right.

235
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:42,307
I'm not without imagination.

236
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:46,976
A counter without currency
is in the offing.

237
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,509
Go over there with that guy.

238
00:23:59,641 --> 00:24:01,595
You do remember me, Andy?

239
00:24:03,723 --> 00:24:06,009
Three times we worked together.

240
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:11,044
Memphis, and on the river,
and in Kansas City.

241
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:15,216
And we were meant to here,
but you fell ill.

242
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,844
I've changed.

243
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:20,678
You're bound to resent my presence
in the camp.

244
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:23,842
Well, see, I haven't changed...

245
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:28,050
or changed the rules which,
against your having gone soft-headed...

246
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:32,080
are fucking inviolate against you
running a game in my territory...

247
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:35,457
without prior arrangement,
and on my fucking terms...

248
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,208
set and agreed in advance.

249
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,877
I'm not running a game, Cy.

250
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,620
I fucking schooled you, Andy Cramed,
to the variety that can be played.

251
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:48,463
I don't practise deception anymore.

252
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:51,248
The opening pronouncement
of a dozen we both can name.

253
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:54,335
I was nursed last fall
in the plague tent...

254
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:58,745
and saved to be born anew
and preach the risen Lord.

255
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,744
The Lord risen, or the wheel,
or the shell and pea...

256
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:05,998
in this camp, for you, it's by my leave.

257
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:10,291
- I will suffer any indignity...
- Which I still have not heard you solicit.

258
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:13,989
Interference with God's work,
I will not suffer.

259
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,744
Then you'd best be moving along, Andy.

260
00:25:18,582 --> 00:25:22,326
'Cause absent tribute,
even as His employee...

261
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,195
you don't get to fucking operate.

262
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:29,578
Don't let me find you trying, Andy.

263
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:34,614
Or it's into the woods once more,
only this time...

264
00:25:34,995 --> 00:25:37,199
left nailed to a tree.

265
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:49,616
I don't know what you'll understand
of my speech, and I don't give a fuck...

266
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:53,361
or what terrorizing them human bonfires
this morning intend towards...

267
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,357
the Chinks still under your thumb.

268
00:25:55,449 --> 00:26:00,153
A white man's son is dead,
that you will be doing business with.

269
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:02,278
On the day of his son's burial...

270
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:05,776
the smell of burning flesh
ought not offend his nose.

271
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,312
The only showing you need make
that you've understood our chat...

272
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:11,809
is a stop to them fucking fires.

273
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,234
And you might want to put off
other violence while you're at it...

274
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,060
as a decency to the day,
you heathen fucking cocksucker.

275
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:21,942
Jesus fucking Christ!

276
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:26,399
There will be no violence between you
and Wu, while the grieving goes on.

277
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:30,188
My God, act civilised even if you ain't.

278
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:32,722
I am a civilised person.

279
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:38,812
Then take your civilisation
and get the fuck out of here!

280
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:52,892
He got the fucking message.

281
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:58,019
- Wait on Wu if you want.
- Wait until what?

282
00:26:58,103 --> 00:27:00,934
You wanna go to the fucking service
or fucking not?

283
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,843
Don't have to ask us twice.

284
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:10,007
What the fuck I wanna go for?

285
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,470
What price will you take for your hotel,
Mr Farnum?

286
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:26,553
- Why do you ask?
- Because I wanna buy it.

287
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:27,835
Do you, sir?

288
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,802
- I presume as agent for other parties?
- Presume away.

289
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,960
Is it warm in here?

290
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:39,749
- To me it seems chilly.
- Chilly, is it?

291
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:43,209
Richardson, Mr Wolcott finds it chilly!

292
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:47,585
Not around. I'll see to it, sir.

293
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:51,669
If you are chilly in 10 minutes time,
pray for my immortal soul...

294
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:55,040
because some fatal mishap
will have befallen me.

295
00:27:56,382 --> 00:28:01,536
Short of which, I will not fail
to dispel the chill now afflicting you.

296
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:10,417
Cocksuckers.
Think they can take away everything!

297
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:12,667
Oh, cocksucker.

298
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:22,041
Found it outside dead,
under the window.

299
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:26,455
- Well, why'd you bring it inside?
- Poor little finch.

300
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,573
Throw it out and wipe your hands.

301
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:36,455
If a bird taps on a window
or crashes into one...

302
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:40,033
that means that there has been a death!

303
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:41,787
We know there's been a death.

304
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:44,574
We know now, but that bird
crashed into the window...

305
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:47,661
and died a while ago, before we knew...

306
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:50,745
for all we know.

307
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,489
I've shined me and Al's,
but I ain't doing yours.

308
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:56,782
Oh, well, I got me some new boots.

309
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:00,732
They pinch bad,
but they got that factory shine still.

310
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,484
Johnny, you can't wear
nothing new to a funeral...

311
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,566
especially not new footwear.

312
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:10,032
I ain't never heard that.

313
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,858
Maybe because when
they was telling it to you...

314
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:16,191
you was too busy listening to that
bullshit about birds flying into windows!

315
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:21,061
To be kept till after
the after-funeral fuck rush is over.

316
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:23,857
Fucking confiscated paraphernalia.

317
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:25,481
Boots on a bar?

318
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:28,393
What is the fucking matter
with you, Dan?

319
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,935
Give me a fucking whiskey bottle.

320
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,190
I'm sprinkling it...

321
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:42,022
at the fucking doorways.

322
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:48,849
Or would you rather
evil traipse past this fucking threshold?

323
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:51,595
Must have brought that
from the other side.

324
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,354
I've wished, sometimes,
only to play checkers...

325
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:02,679
or to occupy myself some other way...

326
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:05,722
than having to see
and feel so much sadness.

327
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:13,015
Or feel, every moment,
how difficult things are to understand...

328
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:15,893
or to live with.

329
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:20,386
I've sometimes felt
I couldn't live with them...

330
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,801
but I find I can, Sofia. I've found I am.

331
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:31,378
Even when I think I'm not, or that I can't.

332
00:30:38,223 --> 00:30:40,509
Can you look to me now, Sofia?

333
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,387
Can you try?

334
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:51,507
I will be so grateful
if you will trust me with your sadness...

335
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:56,337
and I will trust you with mine,
so that even when we are sad...

336
00:30:57,177 --> 00:31:00,376
we will be grateful for
how much we love each other...

337
00:31:01,968 --> 00:31:04,538
and know that we are...

338
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:07,252
in the world as much in our pain...

339
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,797
as in our happiness.

340
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,962
Thank you, honey.

341
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:25,579
Shall we dress now,
and say goodbye to William Bullock?

342
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:28,993
...that no one that's turned in a needle...

343
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,499
try eating the dope
or shoving it up theirselves...

344
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:36,745
as I will be checking eyes
for signs before we fucking leave.

345
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:42,781
And no being drunk, either, Jenn.

346
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:48,245
And wash your fucking mouth.
You got seven kinds of cock breath.

347
00:31:58,497 --> 00:31:59,871
Yeah.

348
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:04,037
Underarms clean, cunts braided?

349
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:08,115
- They're ready.
- You are accountable.

350
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,825
Why not come?
Make them accountable to you?

351
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:15,240
Shut the fucking door behind you.

352
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,270
William Bullock...

353
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,894
beloved son of Martha and Seth...

354
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:04,731
called to God age 11 years...

355
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,856
as we are called by his passing.

356
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,814
Let us bow our heads.

357
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:13,517
From Psalm number 23.

358
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,726
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

359
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,176
"He maketh me lie down
in green pastures...

360
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:26,718
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.

361
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:29,810
"He restoreth my soul...

362
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,056
"He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake."

363
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,928
"Oh that my words were now written.

364
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,004
"That they were graven
with an iron pen and lead...

365
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:56,213
"in the rock for ever.

366
00:33:57,181 --> 00:33:59,964
"For I know that my Redeemer liveth...

367
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:04,510
"and He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

368
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:09,756
"And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...

369
00:34:10,303 --> 00:34:14,675
"yet in my flesh I shall see God.

370
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:18,169
"Whom I shall see for myself...

371
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:22,916
"and my eyes shall behold...

372
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:36,004
"and not another."

373
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:09,410
From Psalm 121.

374
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:15,409
"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills...

375
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:18,282
"from whence cometh my help.

376
00:35:20,246 --> 00:35:24,702
"My help cometh from the Lord,
which made heaven and earth.

377
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,731
"The Lord is thy keeper...

378
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,282
"the Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

379
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:40,490
"The sun shall not smite thee by day...

380
00:35:40,575 --> 00:35:43,110
"nor the moon by night.

381
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:47,235
"The Lord shall preserve thee
from all evil...

382
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:49,611
"He shall preserve thy soul."

383
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:52,103
Let the people come
and say goodbye to William.

384
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:56,061
"...preserve thy going out
and thy coming in from this time forth...

385
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,478
"and even for evermore."

386
00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:04,858
At the request of the family,
the burial is private.

387
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:08,108
On their behalf, at their request,
I thank you all for coming.

388
00:36:08,194 --> 00:36:09,735
Let them see him.

389
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:18,555
Those who wish to pay final respects...

390
00:36:18,651 --> 00:36:23,520
to the corpse of William Bullock
are invited now into the Bullock home.

391
00:37:58,129 --> 00:38:01,708
The girls are gonna be awhile.
They're viewing the corpse.

392
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,665
- Get Wu now, please.
- At the icehouse.

393
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:07,785
How should we set up the shifts?

394
00:38:07,877 --> 00:38:10,496
- What does he mean?
- You know, guarding Wu.

395
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:13,448
Bring Wu here.

396
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:16,031
Put him in one of the whores' rooms.

397
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,283
Didn't make sense when he said it.

398
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,076
That's the first place
Wu's people would look.

399
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:26,081
"Put him on ice."
It's a figure of speech, Johnny.

400
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:28,155
Like, "Got you by the balls."

401
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:32,161
Up you go, little lady.

402
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:40,404
We picked flowers
in William's graveyard.

403
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:43,659
Me and Trixie.

404
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:47,859
"Trixie and l" is how
that's supposed to go, I think.

405
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,028
Yes, Ellsworth.

406
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:57,865
Yes, to the question you've asked me.

407
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:33,979
- Swearengen.
- Swearengen!

408
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,438
Now, Wu. Swearengen.

409
00:39:43,316 --> 00:39:44,891
Swearengen!

410
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:50,345
Mr Wu, why don't you just come with us
like a gentleman?

411
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:24,257
Seems to me, Wolcott,
last your eyes had that unsettled look...

412
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,139
matters got grave for some young girls.

413
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:31,713
What does it? Do you know?

414
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,255
Or does the water
just come on you quick?

415
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:38,291
- "Be ye afraid of the sword!"
- Jesus fucking Christ!

416
00:40:38,387 --> 00:40:40,342
"For wrath bringeth
the punishments of the sword."

417
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:42,383
Get him the fuck out of here!

418
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:52,041
You're a desperate man,
aren't you, Tolliver? Desperate.

419
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:53,923
You feel your position weakening.

420
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:57,705
And what I do, situation like that,
instead of murdering helpless women...

421
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,081
- I get on my hind legs and fight.
- Mr Wolcott.

422
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:06,913
I have nourished a suspicion
that we might pass each other...

423
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,250
in the telegraph office.

424
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,625
I, of course, would be communicating
with Yankton.

425
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:14,043
I wonder, would your messages
be sent to Helena?

426
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,826
Mr Hearst is not a partisan
in territorial rivalries, Commissioner.

427
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,491
Oh, God, I want to believe that.

428
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:24,417
The great man himself
will allay your doubts.

429
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,367
He joins us within the week.

430
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,410
Does he, for a fact?

431
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:35,494
I would hope, sir, that by that time,
Yankton's answer to my telegram...

432
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,995
would authorise me to offer,
and I would've heard accepted terms...

433
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:43,538
of annexation of this camp,
such that a huge banner...

434
00:41:43,623 --> 00:41:45,827
would be hung across
the thoroughfare...

435
00:41:45,915 --> 00:41:50,867
"Welcome, George Hearst,
to Deadwood of Dakota territory."

436
00:41:51,038 --> 00:41:53,324
I don't envy you the interval,
Commissioner.

437
00:41:53,413 --> 00:41:56,114
Ain't it the idle hours that try us?

438
00:41:56,204 --> 00:42:00,197
Ain't they what lead us sometimes
to the cliff, sometimes fucking over?

439
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:04,149
I may have to ask Mr Hearst
if that's his experience, too...

440
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:07,778
or, of any of those that he may know.

441
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:46,142
Let me ask you something.

442
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:51,770
You think you're giving me a treat,
drooling on my fucking nuts?

443
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:55,306
- Because I happen not to enjoy it.
- Sorry.

444
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,184
It's a strange fucking sensation.

445
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:01,308
Distracts me from my hard-on.

446
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:07,221
Fucking caskets.

447
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,811
Bring out the dunce
in the entire fucking community.

448
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:15,467
I took some fucking beating
after my brother's fucking funeral.

449
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:19,477
Smacks coming
from every fucking angle.

450
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:23,098
Still dizzy from the smack from the left,
here comes a smack from the right.

451
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:25,804
Brain can't bounce around fast enough.

452
00:43:26,227 --> 00:43:29,722
Headache I fucking had
for three fucking weeks.

453
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:35,342
Fuck fault is it of mine
if my fucking brother croaks?

454
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:37,340
Ain't even my fucking brother.

455
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:41,212
Fucking people take me in,
I didn't ask them to fucking take me in.

456
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:48,758
Fucking flopping like a fish on the dock,
my brother, the perch.

457
00:43:50,805 --> 00:43:52,629
Fucking falling sickness.

458
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:57,008
Let the old man beat you
because he's sad...

459
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:59,342
he has his load on.

460
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:03,167
I did better in the orphanage,
if that fat-ass Mrs Anderson...

461
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,416
hadn't turned out a fucking pimp.

462
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:11,498
Anyways, how was the funeral?

463
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:15,996
- Did you carry on, disgrace yourself?
- No.

464
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:20,670
- Everyone was sad, I expect.
- But it was pretty, too.

465
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:22,287
Shut up.

466
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,206
Do you dye your hair?

467
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:05,280
Whatever will let us live...

468
00:45:25,243 --> 00:45:26,901
as we are now.
